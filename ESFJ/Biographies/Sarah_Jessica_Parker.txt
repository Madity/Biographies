She is known for her leading role as Carrie Bradshaw on the HBO television series Sex and the City (1998–2004), for which she won four Golden Globe Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and two Emmy Awards. She played the same role in the 2008 feature film based on the show, Sex and the City: The Movie, and in its sequel, Sex and the City 2, which opened on May 26, 2010.
Sarah Jessica Parker was born in Nelsonville, Ohio, the daughter of Barbara Parker (née Keck), a nursery school operator and teacher, and Stephen Parker, an entrepreneur and journalist.[1][2] She was one of a total of eight children from her parents' marriage and her mother's second marriage (her full siblings include actors Timothy Britten Parker and Pippin Parker). After her parents' divorce, her mother married Paul Forste, a truck driver and account executive who was a part of Parker's life from an early age.[3] Parker's father, a native of Brooklyn, was of Eastern European Jewish background; his family's original surname was "Bar-Kahn" ("son of Kohen").[2][4] Parker's mother was of English and German descent; through her mother, Parker is descended from Esther Elwell, one of the accused during the Salem witch trials.[5][6] Parker has identified culturally and ethnically with her father's religion, Judaism, although she has had no religious training.[4] She has said that even while her family lived in Cincinnati, her mother emulated a New York lifestyle.[4]
As a young girl, Parker trained in singing and ballet, and was soon cast in the Broadway revival of William Archibald's The Innocents.[7] Her family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and then to Dobbs Ferry, New York, near New York City, so that she could get specialized training. There, her mother and stepfather helped Parker develop her career as a child actress. In 1977, the family moved to the newly opened planned community on Roosevelt Island, in the East River between Manhattan and Queens, and later to Manhattan. The family later moved to Englewood, New Jersey, where Parker attended Dwight Morrow High School.[8]
Parker attended the School of American Ballet in New York City,[9] the New York Professional Children's School,[9] the School for Creative and Performing Arts in Cincinnati,[10] and Hollywood High School in Los Angeles, California.[11]
Parker and four siblings appeared in a production of The Sound of Music at the outdoor Municipal Theatre (Muny) in St. Louis, Missouri.[12] She was selected for a role in the new 1977–81 Broadway musical Annie: first in the small role of "July" and then succeeding Andrea McArdle and Shelley Bruce in the lead role of the Depression-era orphan, beginning March 1979. Parker held the role for a year. In 1982, Parker was cast as the co-lead of the CBS sitcom Square Pegs. The show lasted just one season, but Parker's performance, as a shy teen who showed hidden depths, was critically well received. In the three years that followed, she was cast in four films: the most significant being Footloose in 1984 and 1984's Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, co-starring Helen Hunt. In 1986, Parker appeared in the cult classic Flight of the Navigator, a Disney science fiction film.
By the early 1990s, Parker's career was gaining momentum. In 1991, she appeared in a supporting role in the romantic comedy L.A. Story; both the movie and her performance garnered positive reviews.[7] The following year, she landed a starring role in the well-received film Honeymoon in Vegas, co-starring Nicolas Cage. Her 1993 role in the film Hocus Pocus was a higher grosser at the box office but received negative reviews. Also in 1993, she starred as a police diver opposite Bruce Willis in the film Striking Distance. The following year, she appeared opposite Johnny Depp in the critically acclaimed movie Ed Wood[7] as Wood's girlfriend Dolores Fuller. The film Miami Rhapsody, in 1995, was a romantic comedy in which she had a leading role. In 1996, she appeared in another Tim Burton-directed movie, Mars Attacks!, as well as in The First Wives Club and The Substance of Fire, in which she reprised her 1991 stage role. In 1997, she appeared as Francesca Lanfield, a washed-up former child actress, in the comedy Till There Was You.
The script for an HBO drama/comedy series titled Sex and the City was sent to Parker. The show's creator, Darren Star, wanted her for his project. Despite some doubts about being cast in a long-term television series, Parker agreed to star.[13] After five nominations, in 2004, Parker won an Emmy Award for her lead role. Parker said in 2006 that she "will never do a television show again."[13][14]
After Sex and the City ended in 2004, rumors of a film version circulated. It was revealed that a script had been completed for such a project. At the time, Parker said such a film would likely never be made.[15] Two years later, preparations were resumed, and the film was released on May 30, 2008. A sequel to the movie, Sex and the City 2, was released in 2010.
In addition to work in film and television, Parker has gained respect as a stage actor, having appeared in well-reviewed lead roles in the off-Broadway play Sylvia, alongside future husband Matthew Broderick in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and the Tony Award-nominated Once Upon a Mattress. In December 2005, Parker appeared in her first film in several years, The Family Stone; she received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress — Comedy for the role. Her next film, the romantic comedy Failure to Launch, co-starring Matthew McConaughey, was released on March 10, 2006, and opened at #1 in the North American box office, grossing slightly over $24 million on its opening weekend,[16] despite mediocre reviews.[17] Parker's work as a producer continued with the independent film Spinning Into Butter (which she also starred in), based on the Rebecca Gilman play.
On July 20, 2006, U.S. cable network Bravo announced it had picked up a reality show produced by Parker under the working title American Artist.[18] Parker participated in the United States version of the hit U.K. television series Who Do You Think You Are? for NBC, in which celebrities were helped to trace their family trees. The executive producer was Lisa Kudrow, and the series featured Parker, husband Matthew Broderick, Kudrow and others.[19]
For now, Parker guest stars on Glee as Isabelle Wright, a Vogue executive who takes Kurt Hummel under her wing after he graduates and moves to New York.
Parker runs her own production company, Pretty Matches, which has been creating content for HBO and other channels since 2009.[20] The company is currently running a web series called "City.Ballet" that takes viewers behind the scenes with dancers of the New York City Ballet.[21]
In 2000, Parker hosted the MTV Movie Awards, appearing in fourteen different outfits during the show.[22]
She has also become the face of many of the world's biggest fashion brands through her work in a variety of advertising campaigns. In August 2003, Parker signed a lucrative deal with Garnier to appear in TV and print advertising promoting their Nutrisse hair products.
In early 2004, shortly after the last season of Sex and the City wrapped up, Parker signed a $38 million contract with the Gap.[23] It was the first multi-season contract in the clothing company’s history, in which Parker was to appear in their upcoming fall ads, and continue until the Spring of 2005.[23] The endorsement sparked many levels of criticism from the public; the glamorous, urban-chic fashionista that her character Carrie Bradshaw has branded her with, was ironic considering the Gap maintains an image that does not promote high-end fashion.[24] Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL strategic retail, suggested that the Gap “felt the need for an iconic but contemporary face to represent [themselves]. . . . they were perhaps feeling a little insecure, a little in need of some high luster around the brand".[23] However, the ad campaigns were a success, and Parker had given the Gap a new, fresh face that appeared in many commercials, online and print ads, and other promotions.
In March 2005, Parker’s contract with the Gap ended, and was replaced with then 17-year old British soul singer Joss Stone. A rising star at the time, Stone’s replacing of Parker was a puzzling move to the public. The company then stated that “While Gap will always seek partnerships with celebrities, musicians and rising stars, we don’t have any future plans to sign a single person to a multi-season deal like the unique and special relationship we enjoyed with Sarah Jessica”.[25]
Parker released her own perfume in 2005, called "Lovely".[7] In March 2007, Parker announced the launch of her own fashion line, "Bitten",[26] in partnership with discount clothing chain Steve & Barry's.[27] The line, featuring clothing items and accessories under $20, launched on June 7, 2007, exclusively at Steve and Barry's.[28]
In July 2007, following the success of "Lovely," Parker released her second fragrance "Covet." In 2007, Parker was a guest on Project Runway for the second challenge.[29] In 2008, Covet Pure Bloom was released as continuous series of Covet.[30] In February 2009, as part of the "Lovely" collection, Parker launched a series of three new fragrances called "Dawn", "Endless", and "Twilight".[31]
Parker was romantically involved with actor Robert Downey, Jr. from 1984 until 1991. They met on the set of Firstborn. Downey had a drug problem, which affected their relationship. Parker has said, "I believed I was the person holding him together."[33]
On May 19, 1997, she married actor Matthew Broderick, to whom she was introduced by one of her brothers at the Naked Angels theater company, where they both performed.[34] The couple married in a civil ceremony in a historic synagogue on the Lower East Side in Manhattan. The couple's son, James Wilkie Broderick, was born in 2002. He was named after Broderick's father, the actor James Joseph Broderick, and writer Wilkie Collins.[35] Parker and Broderick's twin daughters, Marion Loretta Elwell and Tabitha Hodge, were delivered via surrogate in June 2009. Their middle names of "Elwell" and "Hodge" are from Parker's mother's family.[36] As of 2009, she lives in New York City with her husband, son, and daughters. They also spend considerable time at their second home near Kilcar, a village in County Donegal, Ireland, where Broderick spent summers as a child.[37]
According to a March 2013 interview with the Net-a-Porter online magazine The Edit: "Parker runs her own production company, is on the board of The New York City Ballet, is a UNICEF Ambassador and fund­raises for New York schools."[38]
Parker appeared in the premiere episode of the U.S. version of Who Do You Think You Are? on March 5, 2010, where she discovered she had ancestors involved in the California Gold Rush of 1849–50 and in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.[39]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Sarah Jessica Parker was born March 25, 1965, in Nelsonville, Ohio to parents Stephen Parker and Barbra Forste (who remarried Paul Forste after divorcing Sarah's father). After her mother wed Forste, she had four more children, bringing the total to eight. Sarah Jessica now had 3 full siblings and 4 half siblings. Trained in singing and ballet, Sarah was cast in the Broadway production of "The Innocents", which prompted her family to relocate to New Jersey. Already a professional performer (she studied at the American Ballet School and the Professional Children's School), Sarah was cast in "The Sound of Music" (along with four of her siblings), and landed the lead in the Broadway run of "Annie". After a year as the free-spirited orphan, Sarah attended Dwight Morrow High School, while continuing to add more credits to her acting resume. She landed a role in the made-for-TV movie My Body, My Child (1982), before being cast as one of the lead roles in the 1982 sitcom Square Pegs (1982), as high-schooler Patty Green.Once a graduate, Sarah decided to pursue a full-time acting career rather than further her education. Since Square Pegs (1982) did not last more than a year, Sarah moved on to supporting film roles in movies such as Footloose (1984), Firstborn (1984), and the lead role in the teenage film Girls Just Want to Have Fun (1985). Sarah was having lots of fun, although she had yet to land a star-turning role. After more television appearances in series and made-for-TV movies including A Year in the Life (1986), The Room Upstairs (1987) and Dadah Is Death (1988), Sarah finally landed the role of Steve Martin's bubbly lover in the 1991 comedy L.A. Story (1991). More substantial film roles soon followed, starting with a role opposite Nicolas Cage in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992) (which foreshadowed her comedic talent), Hocus Pocus (1993) and Ed Wood (1994).A big Woody Allen fan, she starred opposite the renowned filmmaker in the television movie The Sunshine Boys (1996), and that same year, she landed a starring role in Miami Rhapsody (1995). 1996 was a film intensive year with roles in The First Wives Club (1996), If Lucy Fell (1996), and Mars Attacks! (1996). All the while making a name for herself in film, Sarah was gaining respect as a theater actress, with her lead role as a dog (hard to imagine, but true) in the off-Broadway "Sylvia", and her Broadway roles in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" (starring her present husband, Matthew Broderick), and the Tony-Award nominated "Once Upon a Mattress".But Sarah's star has shot up since her portrayal of Manhattan sex-columnist Carrie Bradshaw in the HBO series Sex and the City (1998). Sarah's Golden Globe Best Actress victory in 2000 only underscores the fact that she plays the role of Carrie as though it were literally written for her. Sarah has been happily married to fellow actor Matthew Broderick for quite a while now. Before the marriage, she dated Robert Downey Jr. (who she also lived with), and the late John Kennedy Jr. When not serving as lead actress and producer of Sex and the City (1998), Sarah is a member of Hollywood's Women's Political Committee, and is UNICEF's representative for the Performing Arts.
      Hosted The 2000 MTV Movie Awards (2000), and changed into 15 different outfits throughout the show.
      Appeared as a special guest star in several episodes of Shalom Sesame (1987), the Israeli version of Sesame Street (1969).
      Played Annie during the original Broadway run of "Annie". Was third in the list of girls to play her.
      Dated singer/songwriter Joshua Kadison. After the break-up, Kadison wrote the song "Jessie" in the early 1990s about dealing with the break-up.
      Named the 52nd annual Woman of the Year by Harvard's Hasty Pudding Theatricals on February 7, 2002.

      After ending her television run of Sex and the City (1998), she negotiated a multi-million dollar contract to do advertisements for The Gap clothing; a brand she never wore once in her entire Sex and the City (1998) show!
      Attended the School for the Creative and Performing Arts (SCPA) in Cincinnati with Rocky Carroll.
      Played a role in the original stage production of "The Heidi Chronicles," only to be replaced when the show moved to Broadway...by Cynthia Nixon, her Sex and the City (1998) co-star. Kim Cattrall played a role in the 1995 film version of the play. That makes Kristin Davis the only regular cast member of Sex and the City (1998) not to appear in some adaptation of the play.
      Finally won an Emmy Award in 2004 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, after five consecutive losses.
      Is the only one out of the four main female actresses of Sex and the City (1998) not to have done any nudity in the show, because she has a strict no-nudity clause in her contract.
      She grew up having to share clothes with siblings and having only one or two pair of shoes for the entire year. She developed a "shoe fetish" that was also shared by her character on Sex and the City (1998). Parker admitted that she has a closet at her home just for her footwear!
      Many gambling and betting establishments actually stopped accepting some bets on Sarah Jessica Parker for the 2004 Primetime Emmys because she was so widely predicted to walk away with an Emmy Award, and she did.
      Hosted the MTV Movie Awards in 2000 and did a spoof with her co-stars in Sex and the City (1998) called Sex and the Matrix.
      After her multi-million dollar contract with the Gap was terminated, she rebounded by joining the ranks of J-Lo, Paris Hilton and Joan Collins by marketing herself and coming out with her own perfume, for which she is being paid in the seven figure range.
      Celebrated her 40th birthday at the Plaza. Among the guests were Kyra Sedgwick, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Noth, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis and Nathan Lane.
Sex and the City (1998) made her a fashion icon to women all over the world due to her extravagant New Yorkian style.
      She and husband Matthew Broderick had movies opening on the same day in the United States: December 16, 2005. His movie was The Producers (2005), hers was The Family Stone (2005).
      Has received eight consecutive Golden Globe nominations from the Hollywood Foreign Press; the first seven were for Actress in a TV Comedy for her work on Sex and the City (1998) and her eighth was for Actress in a Motion Picture - Comedy for The Family Stone (2005).

      Was turned down for the role of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman (1990), which went to Julia Roberts.
      Was offered the role of Danielle Bowden in Cape Fear (1991) but turned down the part. The role went to a younger player, Juliette Lewis.
      In Hocus Pocus (1993), she played a witch who was executed during the Salem Witch Trials in the late 1600s. While researching her family history for the show Who Do You Think You Are? (2010), Parker was shocked to discover that her 10th great-grandmother Esther Elwell was arrested in Salem in the late 1600s for committing "sundry acts of witchcraft" and choking a neighbour to death. Esther's case never went to court, she escaped with her life and the accusation ended the Salem Witch Trials.
      Returned to work two months after the birth of her twins Marion and Tabitha in order to begin filming Sex and the City 2 (2010).
      Returned to work six months after giving birth to her son James in order to begin filming the sixth season of Sex and the City (1998).
      Was six months pregnant with her son James when she completed filming on the fifth season of Sex and the City (1998).
      Gave birth to her first child at age 37, a son James Wilkie Broderick on October 28, 2002. Child's father is her husband, Matthew Broderick.
      Became the mother for the second and third time at age 44, when her twin daughters, Marion Loretta Elwell Broderick and Tabitha Hodge Broderick, was born on June 22, 2009 via surrogate. The children's father is her husband, Matthew Broderick.
      Counts Sex and the City: Valley of the Twenty-Something Guys (1998) as her personal favorite episode of the hit television series, a fact she revealed to host James Lipton as a guest on "Inside the Actors Studio" (19 May 2008).
      Despite playing the lead in a TV series about sexual relationships, Sarah Jessica Parker has always had a no-nudity clause in her contract. She has never done nude scenes in anything she has ever done and is always careful to take work that does not embarrass any of her family members.
      Admits to being quite prudish and clean-living. Even as a teenager, she never rebelled and was very straight-laced; she once went to a party and was so shocked by the amount of alcohol that was there that she made her father take her home straight home. She even had reservations about Sex and the City when she first read its script owing to its explicit content. However, once she signed up to it, she was dedicated to the show and is proud of its success.
      Orignally, she was set to appear with a cameo in Lovelace (2013) as Gloria Steinem. But eventually her scenes did not make the final cut. The role was originally given to Demi Moore, who dropped out due to health issues. Parker accepted the role a week before filming ended.
      Re-negotiated her contract to sell Nutrisse Hair Products in both print and television commercials, for an undisclosed amount believed to be in the seven figure range. [August 2003]
      Her father was of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Her mother has German, and a smaller amount of English, ancestry.
      She ranked #7 on Forbes' List of Highest-Paid Actresses in 2012, with an income of $15 million. It was noted that most of her income was profit from her perfume and endorsement deals.
      With an income of $30 million, she ranked #2 in Forbes Magazine list of "10 Highest Paid Actress of 2010-2011". She was placed behind Angelina Jolie, who also earned $30 million. However, $18 million of Parker's income was not based on her work in entertainment, but gathered by her collaborations with Halston and the best-selling fragrance NYC.
      In 2014, Vogue created the video "73 Questions with Sarah Jessica Parker" in which an interviewer followed her around her apartment and asked a series of random question, all done in just one shot.
      One of her favorite movies is The Way We Were (1973), which also was referenced prominently in Sex and the City (1998). One of her recent favorites is Melancholia (2011).
      Thank you. I've never won anything in my life. - on winning her 2000 Golden Globe Award for Sex and the City (1998).
      I tell my friends married life is boring, but that's just a fun thing to say to make single people feel better.
      The hardest part of leaving the show [Sex and the City (1998)] was this endless gypsy-like life that I'm back into, where it's like being the new kid in school all the time, which for some people is very easy but for me is not. I don't really like change, and I would like everything to be the same constantly, except that I love being terrified.
      Celebrity and the media are reliant on each other - always have been - but we have lost the elegance in that relationship, somehow.
      Fashion is a part of my work. I feel a responsibility to be presentable, to dress up if the occasion calls for it. But, really, fashion does not play that big a role in my life these days.
      One of the things that's great about New York is that it is not a one-industry town. It has education, academia, the service industry, arts, publishing, theater, politics, fashion, finance, as well as movie-making. There are so many people who are cogs in the great wheel of the city that a less bright light is shone on our lives. It still exists - there are always paparazzi at our house - but being a public person feels less like a business than it does in LA. And you have to approach it differently. I can't hide behind gates, or in a car, but if I can get a few yards from my front door, I can still get lost in a crowd. I am always moments, just moments, from obscurity on a crowded street in New York.
      "I get the feeling people are disappointed with me because I don't have the answers for them. I have to remind them that I don't have a Ph.D. in sex or counseling.
      Regarding her new Steve & Barry line of affordable conservative womenswear: "There's not going to be any inappropriate midriff showing, regardless of your age. I really don't care for it. I feel like, as a culture, we have seen enough damage done by it. It's provocative in a way that I just don't feel comfortable with."
      As a woman, I have an inherent need to be all things to all people, to make certain everybody's taken care of. I know I can't sustain that level all the time, so I'm finding the proper balance and it's made me infinitely happier.
      Pat knows the historical context of clothes, the periods of costumes and what century is what. But there are no rules with Pat when it comes to fashion. It's liberating. [on working with fashion designer and costumer Pat Field on Sex and the City (1998).] (Harper's Bazaar - 2004 - "Sarah Jessica's Next Step" by Wendy Wasserstein)
      [on the fact that she adored every costume of Carrie Bradshaw's on Sex and the City (1998).] The hits and misses. It was great fun to make mistakes and also be victorious. If I have a daughter, perhaps I'll give the clothes to her and tell her the extraordinary circumstances under which I received them. (Harper's Bazaar - 2004 - "Sarah Jessica's Next Step" by Wendy Wasserstein)
      I still want to be an actor for hire, but I can also see myself as a hard-driving producer. A person can have both, and I don't think you have to be male to do that. I understand why a lot of actresses are producing now; I understand how seductive it is and how hard it is not to have control. It's like if you were keeping kosher and then one day you had... bacon! You'd just be like: This is nuts! I can't never have suckling pig! I have to have it! Or if you flew coach all the time and then one day you got on, like, Cathay Pacific First Class, where there's a whole apartment on the plane that's yours? You couldn't possibly go back to coach! You're ruined! [on becoming a producer of Sex and the City (1998), in which she stars.] (Vogue - August 2003 - "The Busiest Girl In Town" by Steven Meisel)
      I kind of enjoy the idea that you can be a lady and be slightly titillating and you don't have to take all your clothes off. (Vogue - August 2003 - "The Busiest Girl In Town" by Steven Meisel)
      I have a team of style experts for being Carrie, but I am not Carrie. I'm not even much of a shopper. I don't feel I need a lot of clothes. But I work in an industry where appearance is everything and sometimes I have to work hard at looking good.
      When I go to a premiere I like to borrow lovely clothes and shoes from designers. It's like the library: if you return them in good condition, you get to borrow more. I'm very lucky.
      [on her rumored feud with Kim Cattrall] I don't think anybody wants to believe that I love Kim. I adore her. I wouldn't have done the movie without her. Didn't and wouldn't.
      People should dress the way they want. If you walk out the door feeling good about yourself, that's what counts.

A child performer who went on to become an adult actor in one of the more radical transformations in the history of the American entertainment industry, Sarah Jessica Parker has captained both a career and a public image that could be accurately classified under the heading Revenge of the Nerd. As a pubescent actor most famous for her roles in the acclaimed high school-set TV series Square Pegs and in the big screen's Footloose and Girls Just Want to Have Fun, Parker played the skinny girl with frizzy hair who was either the sidekick or underdog; when she wasn't cleaning up after Lori Singer in Footloose, she was battling snotty rich girls for the right to dance on local television in Girls Just Want to Have Fun. However, thanks to perseverance, talent, a fabulous stylist, and an HBO series called Sex and the City, Parker had emerged, by the end of the 1990s, as one of the most glamorous and employable actors around, known as much for the designer frocks she wore to awards ceremonies as for her work on the screen. Born in Nelsonville, OH, on March 25, 1965, as the fourth of eight siblings, Parker grew up in relative poverty following the divorce of her mother, an elementary school teacher, and her father, an aspiring writer. Raised by her mother and often out-of-work stepfather, she trained as a dancer and singer, bringing home paychecks from a young age. As a fledgling actor, Parker landed her first TV show at the age of eight; in 1976, after winning her first Broadway role in The Innocents, her family moved to New Jersey to encourage her career. Parker worked on the stage for the next few years, touring -- with four of her siblings -- in the national company of The Sound of Music and getting her first major break when she was chosen to take over the title role of Annie on Broadway, from 1979 to 1980.Continuing her training at the American Ballet Theater and the New York Professional Children's School, Parker made her film debut in the 1979 Rich Kids, which co-starred John Lithgow, Trini Alvarado, and Olympia Dukakis. In 1982, she won her first starring role in the aforementioned Square Pegs, and then received additional attention thanks to her role as Lori Singer's best friend and Chris Penn's girlfriend in the 1984 hit Footloose. The following year, Parker kept on dancing -- this time alongside a very young Helen Hunt -- in the similarly winning Girls Just Want to Have Fun. The actor's success in both films paved the way for steady work through the rest of the decade; in addition to her work on the big screen, Parker also starred in a number of TV shows, including the 1986 miniseries A Year in the Life and the drama series Equal Justice.The early '90s saw Parker segue into more adult roles, playing the Southern Californian creation SanDeE* alongside Steve Martin in L.A. Story (1991), then earning both critical and cult credibility as Nicholas Cage's fiancée in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992) and as the wife of consummate schlockmeister Ed Wood in Tim Burton's celebrated 1994 film about Wood's life and times. Offscreen, as well, she was garnering notice for her attachment to actor Matthew Broderick; Parker -- who had been in high-profile relationships with Robert Downey Jr. and John F. Kennedy Jr. -- married Broderick in 1997. Following a turn as Mia Farrow's daughter in the widely panned Miami Rhapsody (1995), supporting work in The First Wives Club and Burton's Mars Attacks! (both 1996), and a number of New York productions (including Sylvia, for which she earned a Drama Desk Award nomination), Parker landed the starring role of New York sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw on the new HBO series Sex and the City. Touted by some observers as the luckiest break in the actor's career to date, the show, which focused on the sex lives of four close friends (played by Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis) became a huge hit among both critics and viewers, ensuring Parker -- who won the Golden Globe for her work in 2000, 2001and 2002 -- both steady employment and an unimpeachably chic image that was eons removed from the bony elbows and frizzy bangs of her days as a square peg. Parker continued to appear in film roles during and after the Carrie Bradshaw years; among them include a starring role in The Family Stone (2005), and a supporting role in the 2008 comedy drama Smart People. In 2010 she starred in Sex and the City 2, and played a devoted mother attempting to balance her family with her career in 2011’s comedy drama I Don’t Know How She Does It. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi

With effortless charm, Parker is a unique star whose career began in childhood. After performing in a few Broadway shows, this precocious performer segued to TV and movies as a teen usually playing appealingly geeky heroines, even though off-screen she was all grown up and living with Robert Downey Jr. In the early '90s she broke up with Downey and transitioned to adult roles with sexy turns in a string of big-screen comedies such as L.A. Story. After shying away from series television for much of the decade, Parker took a chance on the female ensemble comedy Sex and the City and became an instant sex symbol and fashion plate. And while she was portraying a single thirtysomething New Yorker searching for Mr. Right, in real life she was happily married to Matthew Broderick. While researching her ancestry for an episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, Parker discovered that a distant ancestor was accused of witchcraft during the Salem Witch Trials in the late 1690s.Sarah Jessica Parker Fast Facts:

=======================================================
						Sarah Jessica Parker was born in Nelsonville, Ohio on the 25th March, 1965. As a child, Sarah participated in ballet and singing lessons, and was later cast in the broadway musical, "The Innocents". As an adult she went onto star in many television series , her most successful…more
Sarah and her husband, Matthew Broderick, welcomed twin daughters to their family in June 2009. The baby girls, named Marion Loretta Elwell and Tabitha Hodge, were born in Ohio via a surrogate mother.
In 2007, Sarah admitted that her mother still did her laundry for her, because Sarah loved the way it smelled after her mom did it. No matter how much Sarah has tried, and despite using all the same detergents, she can never get it to smell the same. 
Sarah had 81 costume changes in the 2008 Sex and the City Movie. She says her favorite article of clothing from the film was a vintage belt that she actually named "Roger."
Pretty Matches, Sarah's production firm, has teamed up with the producers behind hit US reality programmes Top Chef and Project Runway for a series that will see 12 visual artists tackle different disciplines - such as sculpting and painting - for the chance to win a gallery show, cash prize and a sponsored tour around the US.
In March of 2007, Sarah Jessica Parker announced plans to release a clothing line called "Bitten"  which will be her own low-price, high-fashion line available exclusively at Steve & Barry's stores. Everything in the collection comes in sizes 2–22 and costs less than $20.
Sarah was chosen as one of People Magazine's annual 100 Most Beautiful People in the World, Beauty at Every Age section, for age 42, in May 2007. 
Sarah Jessica is the only one of the four actresses in Sex and The City. never to have done any nudity on the show. This is because her contract has a strict no-nudity clause.
Sarah has been nominated for nine SAG Awards. She was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series from 2001- 2005. She won in 2002 and 2004. She was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series in 2000-2002, and 2005. She won in 2001. All nominations were for Sex and The City.
Sarah received recognition for her role as Carrie Bradshaw when she was awarded a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 2000, 2001, and 2002.
Sarah always dreamed of being Annie and her dream finally came true when she got to play Annie on Broadway.
Sarah has appeared in TV commercials for the clothing brand Gap. She has also modelled Gap clothes for magazine advertisements.  
When Sarah hosted the 2000 MTV Movie Awards she changed into 15 different outfits throughout the show.
Sarah: (revealing she's happy to look her age) It's a real crucible because you feel daunted by your peers who somehow get younger and younger. People older than me have fewer lines than I do. And no, you're not supposed to talk about it - you're supposed to admire the fact that they look 22 even though they're 58.
Sarah: (revealing motherhood has made it difficult for her to wear high heels like her "Sex And The City" character Carrie) I like shoes very much but not to the same degree as Carrie. As a working mother high heels don't really fit into my life any more - but in a totally wonderful way. I would much rather think about my son than myself.
Sarah: I can look back at pictures of myself with the great assurance that I will be embarrassed by about 60 percent of them. This is the nature of fashion.
Sarah: Women will say to me, 'Let me see your shoes.' And then I show them I'm wearing flip-flops... I say 'I'm old now. I can't run around in heels when I go to the market.'
Sarah: (after being named the Unsexiest Woman Alive by maxim.com) What they don't know is that one day I'll wake up fat. But I'll still be happy, just like I am now. I believe in the old 'sticks and stones' philosophy, so frankly their words don't come close to hurting.
Sarah: You don't have to be at the gym for hours -- I've gotten my routine down to 45 minutes. That way it doesn't feel like a chore.
Sarah: (on her new clothing line called "Bitten") It's about affordable, well-made American sportswear. It's about fashion not being a luxury, it's really, really important to us that it be good, feel good, have a life, that it make a difference in your life and that you have money left over to live.
Sarah: I am a city person. I love concrete, I love architecture, and I love the sound of cabs. I get uncomfortable if it's too quiet. I find it unnerving and unsettling. I just wouldn't go anywhere else.
Sarah: (on a possible "Sex and the City" reunion) We all wanted to do a movie but I think that time has passed. There was a script, there were sets, there were costumes, there was a crew, and that's all gone now. The sets are all broken down or sold or in a dumpster or, I don't know, on eBay. It'd be hard to buy it back. All the shoes, we have. We all have our shoes and they can have them back.
Sarah: I just hope that I'm providing my son with a beautiful home that he feels really safe and comfortable in. He loves his house. It's going to be a pretty tough pill to swallow to send him out into the world to live in a studio apartment but that is one of the beautiful challenges of being an adult, being independent. Yes, I can see why it's very appealing to live at home but it's also deeply thrilling being an adult and standing on your own two feet. 
Sarah: (on husband, Matthew Broderick) We don't pretend to hold our marriage up as a model by which everybody else should judge their but we're very happy. I'm not saying that we don't disagree about things or that I don't annoy him constantly, as I'm certain I do, and that there aren't endless issues that enter into things, like, the toilet seat, or picking up his laundry. But for the most part, we seem to have figured it out.
Sarah: I would say that anybody that thinks they can really change another person is slightly misguided. I have so many female friends who date men that have warning signs all over them and they really feel that they are uniquely gifted in some way that they will be the person that finally fixes whatever flaw they have. I find men far more complicated and interesting than that of course.
Sarah: The arts were a big part of my childhood. We went to the theatre and opera a lot as a family. We were not at all wealthy, but it was at a time when the arts were publicly funded and there were free tickets available. For someone like myself who wasn't that academically inclined, it was a great escape. For some reason when I was quite young I began to read about castings in the newspaper and wanting to go to to them. I suppose I found the whole thing quite magical at that age. So I started auditioning, because I didn't see any reason not to. We are not particularly confident or ambitious people in my family, but there were a lot of us in the house and it was a great escape for me. I found it a way to distinguish myself from seven other siblings. I became less interested in school. I still went, but I didn't choose to develop any other skills apart from drama. In the end I didn't really have any other choice. 
Sarah: (on her "Sex and the City" character, Carrie) Carrie definitely left a vivid imprint on those who loved her. She wasn't a perfect heroine and I think that was my salvation in a lot of ways. She was unpredictable, so people didn't always know her next move. I was a working actor for years in films like Honeymoon in Vegas, Ed Wood and The First Wives Club, before I played Carrie. She was an extraordinary character to play for so long, but I still pursue my career in the way that I always did. I still look for interesting characters and stories.
Sarah: I was lucky because I knew Matthew's family very well before we started dating. He was a good of friend of one of my brothers. I actually met his family before I had met him. I was never in that terrifying position of being the new person. Meredith's situation is slightly different because of her poor people skills and inability to know when to stop talking. I think it takes two to be in Meredith's situation. The Stone's could have thrown her a life line. They could see how uncomfortable she was with those surroundings. I have never seen anyone as socially awkward as her though. - comparing meeting her husband's parents to her character, Meredith in her movie "The Family Stone"
Sarah: (on the events that occured on 9/11) Matthew stumbled downstairs in his underwear, looked at the TV and said, 'Oh, my God! My God!' As he went running into the bedroom to get his trousers I saw another plane crash into the second tower. Matthew was outside in no time to look at what was happening. He came back in ashen. It was a demarcation point in our lives, We were bereft. Every part of the attack felt personal to us. It was not random. We in this city were the target. We have this love affair with our city. We would rather have been here that day than be in Los Angeles or Greece or anywhere else in the whole world. It's this sense of community we feel. I thought, 'Thank God we were here. I will go down with this island if I have to.' I would never leave.
Sarah: (about the main character in her film "Failure to Launch") It's very hard imaging being single again, but I tend not to be someone who bases my opinion on something as simple or superficial as someone being hot. If someone did still live at home and they were all grown up but they were really smart, witty, interesting and had a legitimate reason for being there it wouldn't be an issue. I would feel comfortable dating them. I don't know if I'd feel comfortable going into their bedroom and closing the door though... I think that might make me feel weird especially if the parent were there.
Sarah: (on what Christmas is like with her family) I have a very large family - with a total of seven sisters, brothers and half sisters and brothers - so it is tough for us all to get together. We are not particularly religious, so we just see it as a wonderful excuse to be together and relax in each others company. Now we all have partners and children so the house is even more packed. Everyone helps out with the dinner and gets stuck in. It is crazy, but somehow amazingly peaceful. I can only say that to me it is a time when I can finally relax.
Sarah: The hardest part of leaving the show (Sex and the City) was this endless gypsy-like life that I'm back into, where it's like being the new kid in school all the time, which for some people is very easy but for me is not. I don't really like change, and I would like everything to be the same constantly, except that I love being terrified.
Sarah: I get the feeling people are disappointed with me because I don't have the answers for them. I have to remind them that I don't have a Ph.D. in sex or counselLing.
Sarah: Fashion is a part of my work. I feel a responsibility to be presentable, to dress up if the occasion calls for it. But, really, fashion does not play that big a role in my life these days.
Sarah: Celebrity and the media are reliant on each other - always have been - but we have lost the elegance in that relationship, somehow.
Sarah: I tell my friends married life is boring, but that's just a fun thing to say to make single people feel better.
Sarah: One of the things that's great about New York is that it is not a one-industry town. It has education, academia, the service industry, arts, publishing, theater, politics, fashion, finance, as well as movie-making. There are so many people who are cogs in the great wheel of the city that a less bright light is shone on our lives. It still exists - there are always paparazzi at our house - but being a public person feels less like a business than it does in LA. And you have to approach it differently. I can't hide behind gates, or in a car, but if I can get a few yards from my front door, I can still get lost in a crowd. I am always moments, just moments, from obscurity on a crowded street in New York.
Sarah: The last line that I ever uttered, working as an employee on Sex and the City was 'And you can drive up and down this street as much as you want, because I don't live here anymore.
Sarah: When you grow up and you're different, all you want to do is find a way to be the same. And then as a more mature adult...you realize the beauty of thinking on your own.
Sarah: (about husband Matthew Broderick to Life & Style Magazine) I never liked Parmesan cheese, and now I love it. I never like pesto. I let him influence me.
I first saw SJP act on Square Pegs when I was 8,this show was so good it was a shame it only lasted one season.I watched her movies and tv shows,I loved Footloose and Girls Just Want To Have Fun and I loved A Year In ThE Life and Equal Justice,brilliant but canceled shows.I watched her in more movies,one of my favorites being Ed Wood,amazing movie. Then came SATC she is so brilliant as Carrie Bradshaw,I love this character and this show.She is one of the best actresses out there she is beautiful and down to earth and has a legendary career.When some of the actresses today are forgotten she will be a legend.moreless
