Victoria Caroline Beckham (née Adams; born 17 April 1974)[2][3] is an English businesswoman, fashion designer, model and singer. In the late 1990s, Beckham rose to fame with the all-female pop group Spice Girls and was dubbed Posh Spice by the July 1996 issue of the British pop music magazine Top of the Pops.[4] Since the Spice Girls split, she has had a solo pop music career, scoring four UK Top 10 singles. Her first single to be released, "Out of Your Mind", reached Number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and is her highest chart entry to date. During her solo career, she has been signed to Virgin Records and Telstar Records.
Beckham has found more success as an internationally recognised and photographed style icon. Her career in fashion includes designing a line of jeans for Rock & Republic and later designing her own denim brand, dVb Style. Beckham has brought out her own range of sunglasses and fragrance, titled Intimately Beckham, which has been released in the UK and the US. In association with the Japanese store Samantha Thavasa and Shiatzy Chen, she has produced a range of handbags and jewellery. In addition, Beckham has released two best-selling books; one her autobiography, the other a fashion guide.
In her television ventures, Beckham has participated in five official documentaries and reality shows about her, including Being Victoria Beckham, The Real Beckhams, and Victoria Beckham: Coming to America. She has since made a cameo appearance in an episode of American TV series Ugly Betty, and been a guest judge on Project Runway, Germany's Next Topmodel, and American Idol. She is married to David Beckham and they have four children. As of 2009, the couple's joint wealth is estimated at £125 million.[5]
Beckham was born at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex and raised in Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire.[6] She is the first of three children born to Jacqueline Doreen (née Cannon), a former insurance clerk and hairdresser,[7][8] and Anthony William Adams, who worked as an electronics engineer.[6] They founded an electronics wholesale business which allowed a comfortable upbringing for Victoria and her[2] sister Louise and brother Christian Adams.[9]
In 1980, she watched the musical film Fame and subsequently made the decision to pursue a musical career.[10][11] Jacqueline and Anthony Adams enrolled her at Jason Theatre School.[2] In 1991, Beckham entered Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom, Surrey and studied dance and modelling.[2][3] Beckham attended St. Mary's High School in Cheshunt, where she was embarrassed by her family's wealth and often begged her father not to drop her off outside the school in their Rolls Royce.[12] Eventually, she became a member of a band called Persuasion.[13]
Beckham auditioned for a March 1993 advertisement in The Stage which required girls who were "street smart, extrovert, ambitious and able to sing and dance".[6] In 1994, Beckham joined the all-female group, the Spice Girls. In the recordings before her marriage, she is credited with her maiden name as Victoria Adams. The group's first single was called "Wannabe" (1996), and she worked alongside Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisholm. It went to number one in the United Kingdom and United States, and another 29 countries. It was followed by nine further number one singles from their albums Spice, Spiceworld and Forever.[3] Each member of the group received a nickname from the media. Beckham was named "Posh Spice".[14][15] The group was one of the most successful pop acts of the 1990s, selling over fifty-five million records worldwide.[16] After the release of their third album, Forever (UK number 2), which was far less successful than their previous two albums, the Spice Girls stopped recording, leading Beckham to try to build a solo career.[citation needed]
On 14 August 2000, Beckham released her first solo single, "Out of Your Mind" in collaboration with Dane Bowers and Truesteppers.[6] The week of release coincided with the release of "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)" by Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor, resulting in a chart battle dubbed 'Posh vs. Posher' by the tabloids.[17] Before the single's release, on 8 July 2000, Beckham made her public solo debut at London's Hyde Park at a concert to raise money for the Prince's Trust charity. She sang "Out of Your Mind" to a 100,000-strong audience.[18] Beckham then signed a recording contract with her group label Virgin Records.[3] Her next single as a solo artist, "Not Such An Innocent Girl", was released on 17 September 2001.[2] Again, she faced competition in another hugely hyped chart battle, this time with Kylie Minogue's single "Can't Get You Out of My Head".[19] Despite a huge promotional campaign, Beckham was outsold eight to one, and her single debuted at number 6.[20] Beckham's eponymous debut album, which was released on 1 October 2001, reached Number 10 in the UK album chart.[21] The album cost a reputed £5 million to produce and it sold a modest 50,000 copies.[22]
The second and final single to be released from the album was "A Mind of Its Own" on 11 February 2002. The single reached number 6 in the UK[23] and sold 56,500 copies.[24] Rumours soon spread that Beckham was to be dropped by her label for not charting in the Top Three. These were strongly refuted at the time.[25] Beckham commented "You know what newspapers are like, they just like to put all the negative stuff in, but as far as I'm concerned and the record company is concerned it is all great."[25] A third single, "I Wish", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on Friday Night's All Wright.[26] Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B,;[27][28] but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: "No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue."[27][29]
In 2002, Beckham signed a contract with Telstar Records and 19 Management[22] worth £1.5 million.[3] Beckham then began recording a pop-influenced album, Open Your Eyes, which yielded the single "Let Your Head Go", but she allegedly chose not to release it after being disappointed with the results.[30][31] Instead of pop, Beckham wanted a more urban sound and worked with urban producer Damon Dash to work on the RnB and hip hop influenced album Come Together.[22][23] When Dash was first asked why he recorded with Beckham, he stated: "Because I see how much she gets photographed over here."[3] A Dash-produced track "It's That Simple" featuring M.O.P. premiered on radio stations in July 2003,[23] generating mixed reviews.[23] Beckham's first single with Telstar, "Let Your Head Go" / "This Groove",[23] was released in the UK on 29 December 2003, following heavy promotion and many TV appearances across the Christmas period with the video being directed by Andy Hylton. The single charted at Number 3 in the UK.[23] This double A-side lifted "Let Your Head Go" from Beckham's earlier pop-inspired work with "This Groove" one of her Hip-Hop/R'n'B songs and remains Beckham's last single release to date. She is currently the only Spice Girl never to have had a UK solo number one, though she is also the only Spice Girl to have all her single/album releases go Top 10.[citation needed] Outside of the UK, Damon Dash had plans for Beckham in the US, including a potential release of "Let Your Head Go / This Groove" under the name of "Posh Spice Victoria Beckham". The release was proposed for sometime between March to May 2004, but never eventuated.[32]
With the UK media describing her solo music career a failure, combined with a rumoured fall-out between Dash and Fuller, her hip hop album, Come Together, was not released.[2][33] Beckham's final attempt at a solo career came with the announcement of a new single "My Love Is for Real", in which she switched back from urban music to pop. She was dismissed from Telstar when the company became bankrupt, and gave up music to focus her fashion career.[34]
In 2007, the Spice Girls reformed and announced plans to embark upon a reunion tour,[16] from which they were said to have earned £10 million each (approximately $20 million).[35] Victoria had previously stated that she and her former Spice colleagues were enjoying their solo careers in various fields, saying "We're all still doing our own thing."[36] Their Greatest Hits album was released in early November 2007 and the tour began on 2 December 2007. At its advent, Beckham said "I wanted my children to see that Mummy was a pop star. It was the last opportunity for them to stand in a crowd full of people screaming for the Spice Girls."[37] When Beckham had her hair coloured brown for the tour, she stated that her sons immediately reacted by saying "Oh my goodness, it's Posh Spice. She's back."[38] She was the only member of the group not to sing a solo song on the tour, instead posing in the style of a fashion show on a makeshift catwalk, whereas the others each performed a number from their solo careers.[39]
Film-maker Bob Smeaton directed an official film of the tour titled Spice Girls: Giving You Everything, which was first aired on Fox8 in Australia. It later aired in the UK on 31 December 2007 on BBC One.[40] As well as their sell-out tour, the Spice Girls were contracted to appear in Tesco advertisements, for which they were paid £1 million each.[41]
In October 2009, reports suggested that the Spice Girls were to star in a reality show in which they would cast female actors to play their roles in a musical.[42] The following year, Judy Craymer teamed up with the Spice Girls and Simon Fuller to start developing a Spice Girls musical titled Viva Forever. Although the girls are not to be in the show, they are to influence the show's cast and production choices in a story which uses their music but bears no relation to their personal story, similar to that of ABBA's music in Mamma Mia!.[43] On 28 August 2010, it was reported that Jennifer Saunders would pen the script for the Spice Girls' musical, Viva Forever. Saunders had twice previously worked with the group: the first time, appearing in the Comic Relief version for the "Who Do You Think You Are" video, the second, making a cameo appearance in the 1997 feature film, Spice World. On 26 June 2012, all five Spice Girls were in attendance at a press conference in London to promote the launch of Viva Forever: The Musical.[44] The press conference was held at St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, the location where the Spice Girls filmed the music video for their breakthrough hit "Wannabe", sixteen years earlier, to the day.[45] The musical is due to open at the West End's Piccadilly Theatre on 11 December 2012.[44]
On 12 August 2012, after much speculation, Beckham and the Spice Girls performed a medley of "Wannabe" and "Spice Up Your Life" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting solely for the event.[46] Their performance was the most tweeted moment of Olympics closing ceremony with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute.[47]
Beckham has shot five official documentaries. The first, dated 11 January 2000, was called Victoria's Secrets, a programme only shown in the UK on Channel 4. It involved Beckham being followed by cameras while also discussing and interviewing other British celebrities, such as Elton John.[48] The second, Being Victoria Beckham, was broadcast in March 2002 and saw Beckham discussing her career as a solo artist with the release of her first album, and also showed her at various photo shoots and recording sessions. The documentary attracted a strong audience of 8.83 million,[49] coming top in its timeslot.[50] One critic described her as "so clearly level-headed, happy with her not inconsiderable lot and seemingly unfazed by the madly intrusive nature of her monumentally ridiculous fame".[51] The third, The Real Beckhams, aired on 24 December 2003 on ITV1 and focused on the Beckhams' move to Madrid from London after David Beckham was signed to Real Madrid. It also featured Victoria Beckham re-launching her solo career and showed her mocking the tabloid stories she reads in the paper every day. The special received an audience of 6.10 million viewers[52] and was later released on DVD on 2 February 2004.[53]
The fourth was titled Full Length & Fabulous: The Beckhams' 2006 World Cup Party, and followed Victoria and David Beckham organising and making preparations to host a 2006 World Cup Party at a marquee in the grounds of their mansion in Hertfordshire, which aimed to raise money for their charity.[54] Two tickets to attend the ball were auctioned on-line for charity, and sold for £103,000.[55] The documentary aired on 28 May 2006 and showed the event itself, where the menu was designed especially by friend and chef Gordon Ramsay and the charity auction was hosted by Graham Norton.[56] Ramsay catered for 600 guests, with the aid of 40 chefs and 100 waiting staff.[56] The ITV documentary attracted an average of 7.56 million viewers.[57]
To document Victoria Beckham's preparations for her family's move to the US, she signed a deal with NBC for six episodes of a half-hour unscripted reality TV series. Despite original plans for six episodes, the show was cut to a one hour special only as there "just wasn't enough (material) for a series."[58] The show, called Victoria Beckham: Coming to America, aired on 16 July 2007 in the US and Canada. It was heavily scrutinised by the American media and critics, with The New York Post describing it as "an orgy of self-indulgence" and also describing Beckham as "vapid and condescending".[58] The programme was the third-most-watched programme in its time-slot and received viewing figures of 4.9 million in the US, beaten by a repeat of Wife Swap and two sitcoms. The programme aired in Britain on 17 July 2007 on ITV with 3.84 million viewers tuning in.[59] The programme was produced by Simon Fuller who managed her and the Spice Girls on their come-back tour.[60]
In July 2007, it was announced that Beckham would shortly begin filming a cameo appearance as herself in an episode of the second season of ABC's TV series Ugly Betty.[61] The episode, "A Nice Day for a Posh Wedding", aired on 9 November 2007 in the United States and on 23 November in the United Kingdom. Despite her forays into television, Beckham has denied plans to embark upon a Hollywood movie career.[62] In February 2008, it was revealed that Beckham would be the guest judge for the finale of fourth season of Project Runway, which aired on 5 March 2008 in the US.[63]
On 13 September 2001, Beckham released her first book, Learning to Fly.[64] The title was taken from a line in a song from the musical Fame, which Beckham had enjoyed as a child. The verse that inspired the title was: "I'm gonna live forever, I'm gonna learn how to fly".[65] The autobiography documents her childhood, time during the Spice Girls, her marriage and family life, as well as her career at the time.[66] She describes her eating disorder associated with the need to be slim.[citation needed] Learning to Fly became the third best-selling non-fiction title of 2001 and the total UK sales stand at more than 500,000 copies.[67] When the book was first released, it went to Number 1 in the book charts after four weeks of release, relegating Robbie Williams' book to second place.[20] A high-profile guest appearance on Parkinson, watched by nine million people, helped to promote the book.[20] Hello!, The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday joined to buy the rights to preview and serialise the book before its publication. The figure paid was thought to be near £1 million.[13]
Beckham was quoted by a Spanish journalist in 2005 as saying: "I've never read a book in my life".[68] She later explained this was a mistranslation from the original Spanish in which the interview was printed, saying she actually stated that she never had time to finish reading a book because she was always too busy looking after her children.[69]
Beckham's second book, a fashion advice guide titled That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between, was published on 27 October 2006.[70] That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between includes tips from Beckham on fashion, style and beauty,[70] and also contains photography by Mario Testino, Annie Leibovitz and Steven Meisel. The book became another bestseller,[71] and has sold 400,000 copies in Britain alone since it was published in hardcover.[72] The rights have since been sold to the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, Portugal, Lithuania, Russia, and most recently China.[72]
Beckham has achieved a higher level of recognition as an international style icon, rather than as a musician.[16][73] Beckham made a guest appearance on the catwalk for Maria Grachvogel in 2000, marking her debut as a model at London Fashion Week.[74] Beckham also acted as a British ambassador for Dolce and Gabbana[75] and was briefly the face of Rocawear in 2003.[76] Beckham designed a limited-edition fashion line for Rock & Republic called VB Rocks in 2004, consisting mainly of jeans for the high end of the market, retailing at approximately $300 in the US.[77]
On 16 January 2006, Beckham walked the runway for Roberto Cavalli at Milan Fashion Week, and was for a period exclusively dressed by him for red-carpet and social events.[78] For the March 2006 issue of Harper's Bazaar, Beckham acted as fashion editor when she styled her close friend, Katie Holmes, for a fashion shoot.[79] She has admitted to a personal love of sunglasses, saying "I'm quite obsessed with sunglasses. I collect vintage Guccis and Carreras — they can make virtually any outfit look cool."[11] After Beckham's departure from Rock & Republic, in September 2006, she furthered her fashion ventures by launching her own denim label, of which she acts as creative director. The new line of Beckham's jeans collection is called dvb Style.[72][77] Beckham then launched her new official website, dvbstyle.com, which promotes her fashion work.[80]
On 14 June 2007, Beckham launched her dvb Denim collection in New York at the high-end Saks Fifth Avenue, along with unveiling her eyewear range in the United States for the first time.[81] In the same month, Beckham made her first appearance at London's annual Graduate Fashion Week as a judge alongside Glenda Bailey (editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar) and Lanvin's Alber Elbaz, to choose the winner of the River Island Gold Award, worth £20,000.[82] In August 2007, Intimately Beckham perfume hit US stores for the first time.[83] Victoria Beckham has stated "We are not just saying, 'We are celebrities, put our name on it.' I love to be involved with the whole process."[84] The Intimately Beckham line has been predicted to sell over $100 million worth of sales internationally, doubling this estimate in 2008.[84] In September 2007 her debut cosmetics line V-Sculpt was unveiled and launched in Tokyo.[85] In a 2007 appearance at an LA Galaxy press conference, Beckham is credited with having popularised Roland Mouret's 'moon dress' and his brand,[86] and Beckham was also the face of Marc Jacobs for his Spring 2008 collection.[87] Beckham's own fashion collection debuted during the 2008 New York Fashion Week at the Waldorf Hotel.[88] Her first collection was met with positive reviews; "it was a very impressive, accomplished collection, with not a single dud. ... it was the fabrics (silk, wool and organza) and the attention to detail that impressed", wrote one critic,[89] whilst others called it "Beautiful", "desirable" and "classy".[90]
Beckham's first appearance was on the April 2008 cover of British Vogue, then in November she appeared on Indian Vogue, and in February 2009 she made the cover of Russian Vogue.[91] Beckham has voiced her anti-fur beliefs, and promotes an animal friendly wardrobe filled with faux/synthetic furs. Her stand against the fur industry has generated admiration from animal rights organizations, including PETA. Of PETA's numerous anti-fur campaigns, Beckham stated that she is "supportive of its high-profile anti-fur campaigns," and pledged "never to work with fur in any of her own fashion collections".[92] In November 2011, Beckham was awarded the "Designer of the Year" gong at the annual British Fashion Awards.[93]
In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.[94]
In 1997, she started dating footballer David Beckham after they met at a charity football match, prompting him to request a meeting with her.[96] Of their initial meeting, she said, "I didn't really know who he was. I was never into football."[97] The couple announced their engagement in 1998 and were dubbed "Posh and Becks" by the media.[98] On 4 July 1999 they were married by the Bishop of Cork, Paul Colton, at Luttrellstown Castle, Ireland.[99] The wedding attracted much media coverage.[100] Beckham's team-mate, Gary Neville, was the best man,[96] and the couple's four-month old son Brooklyn was the ring bearer.[101] Most of the media were kept away from the ceremony as an exclusive deal with OK! magazine had been arranged, but photographs were released showing the Beckhams sitting on golden thrones.[102] Victoria wearing a diamond coronet created for her by jewellery designer Slim Barrett. A total of 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost £500,000 (US$823,650).[103] The couple bought what would become their most famous home for £2.5 million in 1999;[104] the property, which is set in 24 acres (97,000 m2) of land, was duly given a £3 million renovation and was subsequently dubbed Beckingham Palace by the media.[104] The couple have two bulldogs, Scarlet and Coco.[105]
Victoria and David Beckham have four children: sons Brooklyn Joseph (born March 4, 1999, Westminster, London),[106] Romeo James (born September 1, 2002, Westminster,[107] London),[108] Cruz David (born February 20, 2005, Madrid, Spain);[109][110] and daughter Harper Seven (born July 10, 2011, Los Angeles).[111][112][113] Elton John and David Furnish are reportedly the godparents of Brooklyn and Romeo, and their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley.[114]

In January 2000, a tip-off to Scotland Yard detectives exposed a plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in Hampstead, London.[115] The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made.[115] Later in March 2000, she received a death threat prior to performing at the Brit Awards with the Spice Girls,[115] and in the show's rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage.[115] After a fire door was found to be lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she was terrified by the experience.[115] In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper.[116] All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.[117] In 2004, allegations surfaced that David Beckham had had a brief affair with a former personal assistant, Rebecca Loos.[118] The affair had apparently taken place when David had moved to Madrid, although he denied all the allegations.[118]
It was reported in October 2007 that Beckham had turned down the opportunity to appear in Sex and the City: The Movie. She stated in an interview: "[I was] asked to be in the Sex and the City film, which I would have loved to have done, but because I am in full-on Spice Girls rehearsal mode, unfortunately, I can't do it."[119] Beckham's marriage and career as a singer have made her the 52nd richest woman in Britain[120] and the 19th richest person in Britain with husband David, with an estimated joint wealth of £112 million ($225 million).[5] In 2010, Beckhams's charity work with Save the Children earned her a nomination for the Do Something With Style Award from the VH1 Do Something Awards. The awards show, produced by VH1, is dedicated to honouring people who do good and is powered by Do Something, an organization that aims to empower, celebrate, and inspire young people.[121]

          Victoria Adams was born April 1974. She does not like being called Vicky. Instead, call her Posh, which stands for the best of everything (an old luxury liner term, P.O.S.H. stood for "Port Out, Starboard Home"-- the best rooms). Growing up, she didn't like being driven to school in her father's Rolls Royce (they were very wealthy; later, as Posh, she would have an image of someone who revels in wealth). Victoria began as a dancer before eventually landing a spot as a member of Spice Girls. While in college, Victoria was briefly in another band. After completing the 3-year course at Lanie Arts, she answered an ad in "The Stage" magazine, which was looking for 5 girls who could sing and dance. Victoria was picked, history was about to be made.

The Spice Girls became fantastically successful, achieving international fame. The wildly popular Spice Girls performed at sold-out concerts, did tours, and of course the Spice World (1997) movie. Victoria married soccer player David Beckham, and they had a son in 1999.

      [on fame] I cope because I have to, because it's just the way my life is. I'm hardened to it. I know how I'm perceived is not how I am, and that's what matters. When they say I'm too thin, I just think: you know what? I'm happy to be thin. I'm into fashion and I like to be able to wear whatever I like. It's my business, and if other people don't like it, that's their business.
      If a bride could splurge on a single thing, it's the booze, because that's what guarantees more fun.

=======================================================
                Victoria Beckham came to fame as Posh Spice in the largest girl band of all time and has now managed to make a name for herself as a fashion designer.Mother of four, football Wag, fashion designer and Posh Spice, Victoria Beckham was born Victoria Caroline Adams on 17 April 1974 in Hertfordshire. She is the eldest of the three children of Jacqueline and Anthony Adams, who worked as an electronics engineer and later founded an electronics wholesale business.  This meant that Victoria and her siblings Louise and Christian led a comfortable lifestyle. She doesn't like being called Vicky but instead prefers POSH, which stands for Port Out Starboard Home – an old luxury liner term for the best of everything.  From a young age, she took ballet lessons and was enrolled at the Jason Theatre School after watching Fame and deciding she wanted a career in music. She then attended St Mary's High School where she didn't like her father dropping her off in their Rolls Royce. Victoria was frequently bullied and often felt like an outsider.  Victoria then enrolled at Laine Theatre Arts School in Epsom, Surrey in 1991 for a three-year-course on dancing and modelling. At the age of 20 years, she moved to London to pursue a career in dance. Her big break happened when she answered an ad for an energetic and hard-working young woman for a girl band in 1993. Out of 400 women, she was chosen to form part of the group.  This was the beginning of her career as the band were called The Spice Girls, which was created by manager Chris Herbert. By mid-1993, all the members had been chosen – Victoria, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm and Geri Halliwell. As the band wanted more creative control, they parted with Herbert and signed with Brian Fuller. He helped them sign a contract with Virgin Records.  All five girls developed their own personas, which reflected what they wore on stage. Victoria became Posh Spice and was often seen on stage wearing little black dresses and heels. In 1996, they released their debut album Spice and its lead single Wannabe saw them reach the top of the charts in both the UK and US. This was followed by second single Say You'll Be There, which was also a success.  The band became one of the biggest in the world with their message of Girl Power and merchandise that appealed to young girls. In 1997, they released Spiceworld, which included the Christmas number one single 2 Become 1. The following year, they starred in their own film Spiceworld, which had cameos from Elton John, Hugh Laurie and Bob Geldof.  In 1998, Geri Halliwell announced she was leaving the band and while fans were worried this would be the end, the remaining four girls promised to keep going. They released the album Forever in 2000 before deciding to go their own ways.  Victoria chose to pursue a solo career releasing Out Of Your Mind in collaboration with Dane Bowers and Truesteppers on 14 August 2000. It peaked at number two in the UK charts. She then signed a deal with Virgin Records and went on to release singles Not Such An Innocent Girl, A Mind of Its Own and a self-named album.  On 29 December 2003, she released Let Your Head Go/This Groove, which reached number three. This was her final solo track. In 2007, the Spice Girls reunited to release a Greatest Hits with Halliwell and play a series of concerts into 2008. They also appeared together twice in 2012 – first to launch the Spice Girl musical Viva Forever and secondly to perform at the Olympics Closing Ceremony on 12 August 2012.  While her music career was going from strength-to-strength, her love life was too. She met football player David Beckham at a match in 1997 and they were soon being followed by the tabloids everywhere they went. They were dubbed Posh and Becks. After getting engaged in 1998, Victoria gave birth to their first son Brooklyn Beckham in March 1999.  Victoria and David wed at a castle in Ireland on 4 July 1999. The following year, she invited the cameras into her home in the reality show Victoria's Secrets before writing her autobiography Learning To Fly in 2001. The following year she gave birth to her second son Romeo Beckham.  In 2002, she hit the headlines when the authorities uncovered a plot to kidnap her and hold her for ransom but this never came to pass. The following year, David left Manchester United after 14 years and signed a deal to play for Real Madrid. Victoria, of course, followed her husband and settled the family in Spain.  She then started to carve out a name for herself in fashion. One of the most photographed women in the world, she is either a fashion inspiration or disaster depending on her choice of clothes. In 2004, she developed a line of jeans called VB Rocks for the Rock and Republic brand.  In 2005, she gave birth to son Cruz Beckham before moving to Los Angeles, California with her family as David joined the football team LA Galaxy in 2006. They caused a media frenzy and were often snapped with top celebrities, such as Tom Cruise. Victoria also managed to write That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between, which imparted her fashion knowledge. Since moving to the US, she has also made friends with Heidi Klum and Eva Longoria.  Victoria then launched her own line of sunglasses in 2007 followed by a line of jeans. She expanded her fashion range in 2008 with a new line of dresses that Beckham said she would wear herself. She then unveiled her own fragrance called Beckham Night and became the model for the Emporio Armani's female underwear range in 2009.  Since then, she has launched a His and Her perfume with her husband and a successful fashion line called VB. She debuted a range of evening gowns at New York Fashion  Week in 2008. Her designs were even recognised in the Olympics Closing Ceremony. In 2011, the couple also had their first daughter and called her Harper Seven.

							"If you haven't got it. Fake it! Too short? Wear high heels!" says Victoria. Having risen from obscurity as one of The Spice Girls and gone on to become half of one of the world's most high-profile couples, the singer can walk the walk - but she's certainly no fake.						
						Born Victoria Caroline Adams on April 17, 1974, in Hertfordshire, England, to parents Tony and Jackie, the singer admits to having wanted to be a star from the age of eight, after seeing the film Fame. Recognising the showbiz bug in their little girl her parents sent eight-year-old Victoria to the Jason Theatre School in Enfield where she studied until she was 17. 
A year later the budding performer moved on to Laine Arts Theatre College in Surrey, taking dancing lessons on the side. Three years later she answered an ad in the magazine The Stage looking for five girls who could sing and dance. It was to be her ticket to fame. The female quintet Geri Halliwell, Mel B, Mel C, Emma Bunton and Victoria would go on to become The Spice Girls. 
The band's first single, Wannabe, went straight to number one and, for a few years, the girls couldn't put a foot wrong. Capturing the imagination of youngsters around the globe, they notched up hit after hit, breaking records in the process. 
In 1997, when the Spice Girls were at the peak of their popularity and starring in their own movie Spiceworld, Victoria met her future husband, footballer David Beckham. The couple married two years later and have three sons - Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz. There's also a new arrival expected in the summer of 2011.
Everything changed in 1998, however, when the de facto leader of the group, Geri Halliwell, quit. The remaining Spices continued without her for a while, but marriage, motherhood and solo careers began to take precedence. Although Victoria released a solo single Not Such An Innocent Girl and self-titled debut album in 2001, her family was increasingly central to her life. 
In May 2003 she teamed up with US hip hop artist Damian Dash, but the project fizzled. Since then she's focused her attention on fashion, collaborating with several international design labels. 
In 2006 she published the style guide That Extra Half Inch, and has created jeans, handbags and a popular range of sunglasses under her DVB brand. "I dreamed of doing my own clothing line even before I was a Spice Girl," she says.
As her commitment to fashion developed, so did her social life. She cemented her friendship with Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, whose Rome nuptials she attended in 2006, and became pals with other members of the pair's exclusive Hollywood circle, including Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and Will Smith. The following year David signed to American soccer team LA Galaxy, and his family July relocated to California. 
In June 2007 Victoria dipped a toe back into the music scene when she reunited with her fellow Spice Girls to release a greatest hits album, which was followed by a world tour. 
Posh's real interest remained her design ventures, however. "It's been so much fun being a Spice Girl and I've loved every minute of it," she announced. "It's been great for my children to see mummy being a pop star. But it's been tough as well because fashion is my passion, not music." 
In 2009 Victoria released a Spring Summer line of dresses for her new fashion label Victoria Beckham. The collection has gradually grown over the past few years, with some major celebrities choosing to wear her designs on the red carpet. 
In July 2011 Victoria and husband David welcomed their first baby daughter into their family, Harper Seven Beckham.

Photograph by Mario Testino. Published in Vogue, December 2003.She may have entered the cultural lexicon as Posh Spice back in the 1990s—first, as a member of the bubblegum-pop phenomenon the Spice Girls, then as the wife of the lady-killing soccer player David Beckham—but Victoria Beckham only truly earned her nickname when she took to the London catwalk for the designer Maria Grachvogel in February 2000, sporting hot pants and a flamenco dress.
Since then, Beckham has emerged as one of the most unexpectedly serious fashion contenders in recent memory. Yes, she has been the face of Dolce & Gabbana, Marc Jacobs, and the street label Rocawear; she has walked the runway for Roberto Cavalli in Milan, and caused quite a stir when she posed with her muscular husband for a steamy ad campaign for Emporio Armani’s underwear line. But all that is par for the course, when it comes to celebrities of her ilk. It is her ever-increasing cred as a designer that has lifted her above the “pop singer creates a fashion line” fray.
In 2004, Beckham collaborated with the denim label Rock and Republic to create a line of jeans. In 2006, under the brand dVb Style—a monogram, of sorts, for David and Victoria Beckham—she launched her own denim line, as well as fragrance and eyewear ranges. (Sunglasses “hide a multitude of sins,”[1] the famously poker-faced star remarked. “Sunglasses—and a great pair of heels—can make virtually any outfit look cool. . . . They also happen to hide the fact that I’ve been up all night with my three children and didn’t have time to put on any eye make-up.”[2]) It wasn’t until September 2008, however, when she debuted her Victoria Beckham label with a collection of spring dresses at New York Fashion Week that the movers and shakers really began to sit up and take notice. She quickly forged a distinct design signature: neat-fitting, rather Roland Mouret–esque hourglass frocks, with lots of long zips, and body-conscious tailoring. The reviews have been consistently strong. “She takes conventional dresses and makes them stand out,”[3] said British Vogue’s editor, Alexandra Shulman.
As she grows as a designer, the Victoria Beckham look has evolved toward looser silhouettes with softer drapes and longer hemlines. “My first seasons had lots of structure and corsetry, but now I want women to have the freedom to be more comfortable as well as beautiful,”[4] she told Vogue’s Sarah Mower in 2011. 
Although her persona—in the tabloids, as well as a brand—is posh, Beckham comes from a solidly middle-class background that, she has said, has informed her work ethic in a very positive way. Despite having married one of the wealthiest men in international sports, she knows the value of being self-made. “I don’t do anything by halves,” she told The New York Times in 2010. “If you’re going to do something, do it properly, I think. Otherwise there is no point in doing it at all.”[5]
Victoria Caroline Adams born to Jackie and Anthony Adams—an electrical engineer who owns supply warehouses—in affluent Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire, England. As a child she will be embarrassed by her family’s relative wealth and beg her father not to drop her off at school in his Rolls Royce.
Watches Fame and decides she wants to pursue music. Her parents send her to the Jason Theatre School.
Heads to Laine Arts Theatre College in Surrey. Answers an ad in The Stage seeking girls who are “streetwise, outgoing, ambitious,”[6] and able to sing and dance. Picked—along with Melanie Chisholm, Geri Halliwell, Melanie Brown, and Emma Bunton—to become part of the group that eventually will be the Spice Girls.
Marries David Beckham at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland. Wears a strapless ivory gown designed by Vera Wang with a 20-foot train that reportedly costs £60,000. Son Brooklyn Joseph Beckham born at the Portland Hospital in central London.
Wearing hot pants, makes her debut on the runway at Maria Grachvogel’s London Fashion Week show. Reappears for the finale in a burgundy flamenco dress.
Named brand ambassador for Dolce & Gabbana. “We want to become a bit more exclusive and not make clothes for every celebrity who asks,” Stefano Gabbana says. “So we have picked one person from each country to work with, and the British celebrity will be Victoria.”[7] Becomes the face of Rocawear, along with Naomi Campbell.
For Rock and Republic, codesigns jeans, skirts, and knits. “I’ve always been interested in fashion,” she says. “It’s something which comes very naturally to me.”[8]
Splits with Rock and Republic. Launches her own denim line, dVb Style, as well as an eyewear range. Launches fragrance line, Intimately Beckham. At the Metropolitan Museum’s gala for the “Anglomania” exhibition, rocks the red carpet in a strapless scarlet Roland Mouret ballgown.
Wins two British Glamour magazine awards, for Woman of the Year and Entrepreneur of the Year. The Beckham family moves to America after David signs a deal to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy.
Marc Jacobs casts her as the face of his spring campaign. “Fashion is about risks,” he will say, “and I think that both of us work very, very hard.”[9] April: Appears on the cover of British Vogue. Reportedly sues Rock and Republic for $100 million for “loss of earnings”;[10] the jeans company later files Chapter 11 bankruptcy. September: Introduces the Victoria Beckham collection at New York Fashion Week. November: Appears on the cover of Vogue India.
Introduces handbags to her line for spring 2011. Vogue says the low-profile line “succeed[s] brilliantly.”[11]
February: Adds coats to her collection for fall. July: Daughter Harper Seven born. September: For spring 2012, introduces secondary label, Victoria by Victoria Beckham.
February: Shows fall line at New York Public Library. “If there’s still any doubt about her credibility as a fashion designer, this fall collection should erase all of that,” Forbes gushes. “What she sent down the runway was a coherent collection of well-made clothes that any woman would want to wear.”[12] April: Profiled in Vogue by Hamish Bowles, who praises the secondary line, now called simply Victoria.
