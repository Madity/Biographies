Randall Darius "Randy" Jackson (born June 23, 1956) is an American bassist, former television music competition judge, singer, record producer, entrepreneur and television personality. He is best known from his former work as a judge on American Idol and executive producer for MTV's America's Best Dance Crew. Jackson is currently a mentor on American Idol and has won a Grammy Award as a producer.[1]
Jackson was born on June 23, 1956, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the son of Julia, a homemaker, and Herman Jackson, a plant foreman.[2] His first marriage, to Elizabeth Jackson, was dissolved in 1990; they had one daughter named Taylor.[3] In 1995, Jackson married Erika Riker, with whom he has two children, a 14-year-old daughter named Zoe and a 12-year-old son named Jordan. In 2003, Jackson lost 114 pounds (52 kg) following gastric bypass surgery. He stated in a February 2008 television commercial that he has type 2 diabetes.[4]
In the early 1980s he played on three albums for Jean-Luc Ponty and with the rock band Taxxi. From 1986 to 1987 he was a session musician for the rock group Journey. Jackson played on Journey's 1986 album Raised on Radio. He moved to Italy in the late 1980s and played on a record by Italian pop star Zucchero. The record, Zucchero and the Randy Jackson Band, was produced by Corrado Rustici who played guitar with Jackson on many albums in the early 1980s. He also played with Billy Cobham.
In 1985, Keith Richards was asked to provide music for the Whoopi Goldberg comedy vehicle Jumpin' Jack Flash. Richards assembled an all-star band which included Aretha Franklin on piano and lead vocals and Jackson on bass guitar. This song was the fourth track on Aretha's 1986 album titled Aretha. Jackson can be seen in the song's video.
In the late 1980s, Jackson was still doing sessions. He was notably on the first solo album by famed session guitarist Steve Lukather. Jackson was a featured bass guitarist on five songs on Maze's 1989 "Silky Soul" album. He also performed on several of Kenny G's albums.
Jackson was the bass guitarist on the 1991 self-titled Divinyls album (which features the song "I Touch Myself") as well as featured bassist on several tracks of Tracy Chapman's 1992 release, Matters of the Heart. He performed on the singles "Bang Bang Bang", "Open Arms", and "Dreaming on a World". That same year, Jackson also played bass on Bruce Springsteen's song "Human Touch."
Jackson has recorded, produced, or toured with many well-known artists and bands, ranging from Mariah Carey (he has worked with her throughout her career, been her musical director for a number of her tours; he has formed part of her band during numerous performances including Live 8 in London in 2005) to 'N Sync, Whitney Houston, (produced) Dionne Farris' (critically acclaimed debut CD, Wild-Seed Wild-Flower), Céline Dion, Fergie (dating back to her days in Wild Orchid), Stryper,[5] and Madonna (he played some bass on her album Like a Prayer although not on the single of the same name).
Jackson played numerous times in Jean-Luc Ponty's backing band. His credits as a session musician range from playing with Aldo Nova, George Benson, Blue Öyster Cult, Jon Bon Jovi, Michael Bolton, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, Billy Cobham, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Herbie Hancock, Ernie Isley, Billy Joel, Brent Bourgeois, Journey, Richard Marx, George Michael, Stevie Nicks, Imogen Heap, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Waters to playing at the Grand Ole Opry with The Charlie Daniels Band. His production/songwriting work in the San Francisco Bay Area with Narada Michael Walden and Walter Afanasieff led Jackson to be in demand as a producer as well.
On March 11, 2008, Jackson released an album produced entirely by himself, titled Randy Jackson's Music Club, Vol. 1. The album's release was preceded by the single "Dance Like There's No Tomorrow" sung by Paula Abdul. In 2009, Randy began working with former Idol finalist Kimberley Locke, producing her 4th album. The lead single, "Strobe Light", was released March 16, 2010.[6] In February 2010, Jackson participated in We Are the World 25 for Haiti as part of the chorus.[citation needed]
Jackson is the manager for the Charlotte-based band Paper Tongues. With the help of Jackson, they signed with a major label, A&M/Octone Records. He has also worked as an executive, spending eight years as vice president of artists and repertoire (A&R) at Columbia Records and four years heading A&R at MCA Records.
Starting back in 2002, Jackson is one of the panel judges on the Fox Network reality television series American Idol, along with Paula Abdul (2002–2009), Simon Cowell (2002–2010), Kara DioGuardi (2009–2010), Ellen DeGeneres (2010), Jennifer Lopez (2011–2012), Steven Tyler (2011–2012), Nicki Minaj (2013), Mariah Carey (2013) and Keith Urban (2013). As a result of Cowell's departure, Jackson is left as the sole original judge on American Idol. His role was originally going to be reduced to that of a mentor, so the 2013 season will have all new judges,[7] but it was later decided that he will remain as a judge for season 12.[8] On May 9, 2013, Jackson announced that he would be leaving American Idol after twelve seasons due to him wanting to focus on other business ventures.[9] On September 3, 2013, it was announced that Jackson would replace Jimmy Iovine as the in-house mentor on American Idol.[10]
Jackson also hosts a radio top 40 countdown known as Randy Jackson's Hit List,[11] which is syndicated by Westwood One.[12] Every week, Jackson counts down his top 30 Urban AC and Mainstream AC hits. He also gives behind-the-scenes information on American Idol on the internet radio station Artist Underground.
Jackson produces America's Best Dance Crew, an American group dance competition and reality television show, which premiered on February 7, 2008 on MTV and was cancelled in 2010 due to declining ratings.[13] Each week, the teams showcase their creative talents in choreography and their dance skills, and one crew is eliminated by the judges. The competition continues until the sole winning dance crew is awarded the title of America's Best Dance Crew, and a cash prize of $100,000.[14] Jackson has admitted to using the show as a platform for his banner-making company.[citation needed]

Steven Randall "Randy" Jackson (born October 29, 1961) is an American singer and musician, a former member of The Jacksons. Nicknamed "Little Randy" he is the youngest of the Jackson brothers, and the second youngest of the nine Jackson whole siblings, before sister Janet.
Randy was only three when the Jackson 5 was formed and therefore was not an original member. While his brothers toured, he honed his skills as a musician, mastering piano.
Randy was born in Gary, Indiana to Joseph Jackson and Katherine Jackson. He was the youngest son and the second youngest Jackson sibling before his sister Janet Jackson.
Jackson has two children with his ex-girlfriend Alejandra Oaziaza, Genevieve Katherine (b. 1989). He also has one daughter, Steveanna (b. 1990), with his ex-wife Eliza Shaffy.
Randy first officially appeared live with his brothers at the end of 1971. The event was a Christmas show the Jackson 5 held for blind children. Although he was on every Jackson 5 tour from 1972 forward mainly playing the congas among other instruments, Randy didn't officially join the family band until 1975 when they left Motown Records for Epic Records and older brother Jermaine choose to stay with Motown, prompting Randy to replace him. The Jackson 5 officially changed their name to The Jacksons when they signed with Epic due in part to the fact Motown owned the name The Jackson 5. At the age of 16, he co-wrote The Jacksons' most successful single on Epic, “Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)” with Michael. He is widely thought of as the most talented instrumentalist of the Jackson brothers, playing congas, drums, keyboards, piano, bass, and guitar. In addition to singing and playing on the Jacksons' recordings, he worked with Michael on his Off the Wall album.
On February 4, 1980, Randy was seriously injured in a car crash in Hollywood, California. In June 1980, he appeared on the cover of the weekly African-American newsmagazine Jet. The cover headline read: "Randy Jackson Walks Again: Talks About His Future."[1]
Jackson was able to fully participate in the Jacksons' 1981 Triumph Tour and in the band's later projects. After the record-setting Victory Tour in 1984, Michael and Marlon left the band. Randy and his remaining three brothers later made one last album. He was part of the Jacksons 2001 reunion at Madison Square Garden, but chose not to appear on their 2009 A&E reality series The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty. However, he did contribute backing vocals with Jackie, Tito and Jermaine for Michael's This Is It.
After recording the 2300 Jackson Street album, the group disbanded and focused on separate projects in 1990. After this split, Jackson formed his own band, Randy & the Gypsys. The group only released one album before breaking up. On June 28, 1998, Jackson opened up his own record label Modern Records.
On June 25, 2009, his older brother Michael Jackson died after suffering a cardiac arrest at his home. On July 7, 2009, Jackson attended Michael's memorial service along with his brothers and family. Randy gave his first interview since the death of his brother on CNN during a live segment on June 10, 2010.

Life's WorkA talented and versatile bass player, Randy Jackson is also a prolific performer and record producer. After more than twenty years in the music business as a session player and record company executive, Jackson moved into the public spotlight in 2002 when he became one of the three judges on hit television talent show, American Idol.Jackson was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1956. He was the youngest of three children born to Herman Jackson, who worked at the local Exxon plant as a foreman, and his wife, Julia. In high school, Jackson was an accomplished athlete, but his first love was music. Inspired by hearing a local R&B band rehearsing in his neighborhood, he learned how to play the bass guitar; his brother, Herman, became a drummer. "I was so enthralled," Jackson told People magazine in a 2003 interview. "I thought, 'Wow, I wanna be one of those guys.'" As a teenager, he would sneak out in the evenings to hear live music and perform in local clubs.Worked as Touring MusicianJackson attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, studying music. He took some time off in his senior year in order to acquire more practical experience, playing in jazz drummer Billy Cobham's band and appearing on two of Cobham's records. After graduating from Southern in 1979, Jackson embarked on a full-time career in music. A talented keyboardist as well as a bass player, equally at home in jazz, pop or rock, he soon found ongoing work as a session musician (as well as a nickname Randy "The Emperor" Jackson) in studios on both coasts of the United States.After some early recording work with Jean-Luc Ponty, Bobby McFerrin, and a number of jazz fusion artists, Jackson played bass in a pickup band that included Carlos Santana and members of the Grateful Dead, playing at free concerts and benefits in and around San Francisco. He was hired by the rock group Journey to play bass on their 1983 album, Frontiers and, after Jackson performed on Raised on Radio, Journey invited him to tour with them to promote the album. Although the band then went on a prolonged hiatus, Jackson maintained his friendship with front man Steve Perry, and helped him assemble a band for his 1994 solo album, For the Love of Strange Medicine, and subsequent tour.Jackson later referred to the 1980s as a "bold, wild, crazy" period of his life, according to US Magazine. He became a sought-after performer, easily recognizable because of his distinctive, six-inch-high flat-top hairdo. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, his reputation as a stellar player won Jackson some high-profile touring and studio gigs with a diverse range of artists, including Madonna, Tracy Chapman, Kenny G, Aretha Franklin, Cher, Elton John, and Michael Bolton. He played bass on Bruce Springsteen's Lucky Town and Human Touch albums, both released in 1992. He also played keyboard and bass on Whitney Houston's first two albums, and performed on Celine Dion's first English-language album, Unison. Touring with Bob Dylan, Jackson was the bass player on two Dylan albums, Down in the Groove, and Under the Red Sky.Moved to Los AngelesJackson's musical ambitions extended beyond working as a sideman. Writing songs as well as performing, he grew "really tired of being the session guy," he told People magazine. In the early 1990s, he moved permanently to Los Angeles to find more creative opportunities.Jackson became vice president of A&R at Columbia Records, a position he held for eight years. At Columbia, Jackson produced and co-produced a number of albums, including Eddie Money's Right Here, Trisha Covington's Slow Down, and Flesh and Bone by Richard Marx. He also worked on a number of soundtracks and compilations, including First Wives' Club and The Truth About Cats & Dogs. He subsequently spent four years at MCA Records as senior vice president of A&R, producing Rahsaan Patterson's Love in Stereo, Gladys Knight's At Last, and Jesse Powell's 2001 album, JP.At Columbia Records, he had met and worked with Mariah Carey, who asked him to write and produce two songs, "Fireworks" and "I Know," for her 2001 film, Glitter. He also co-wrote two songs on Carey's 2003 album, CharmBracelet, "My Saving Grace" and "Irresistible."Became American Idol JudgeIn early 2002, Jackson's agent suggested he meet the production team behind a new reality TV show, American Idol. Developed by former Spice Girls manager and powerhouse producer Simon Fuller, American Idol was based on the popular British sensation, Pop Idol. The format was a televised singing contest, in which young singers competed for a recording contract, their performances assessed each week by a panel of judges. The show's twist was the involvement of the general public, who voted in record numbers by telephone to keep favorite contestants. Pop Idol had made a star of several of its young performers, as well as one of the judges, sharp-tongued record producer Simon Cowell.After more than a decade in Los Angeles, Jackson was a respected industry veteran, whose credits included over a thousand gold and platinum albums. His first reaction to the concept of American Idol was not positive. "TV's corny, cheesy, whatever," he told LA radio DJ JoJo Wright, in an interview posted on the deejay's website. Despite his years of experience in the music business, Jackson had spent little time in front of the camera--aside from a 1992 bass guitar instruction video, Randy Jackson: Mastering the Groove, and a guest appearance in the 1990 television special, Mother Goose Rock n' Rhyme. "I've been behind the scenes with all these artists," he said in a Newsweek on-line interview. "I've seen celebrity up close, but I've never really lived it."Believing the music business to be in a creative slump, Jackson had strong feelings about the increased emphasis on looks over talent, as well as concerns about the longevity of many new artists. But watching tapes of the original British version of the show persuaded Jackson to change his mind, joining Simon Cowell and singer Paula Abdul on the American Idol judging panel. "I'm doing the same thing I do as an A&R person," Jackson was quoted as saying in an interview with the Miami Herald. "You know what you're looking for, what makes a star."American Idol's star search attracted tens of thousands of aspiring singers in seven cities. In Los Angeles alone, an estimated 11,000 people registered for the second season's auditions, only two of whom made it through to the show's final 12, according to a special American Idol edition of People magazine. Although the judges were not asked to hear all the contestants, Jackson found the grueling audition process exhausting and at times dispiriting, despairing of the delusions of many of the hopefuls. "This is a hard, tough, tough business," he told Newsweek, "I think karaoke has done the record industry a huge disservice."American Idol proved a massive hit for the Fox network, swiftly graduating, said US magazine, "from guilty pleasure to outright pop culture obsession." The first season attracted an average of 12.7 million viewers, while the second season averaged 21.7 million, with more than 38 million viewers tuning in for the finale, according to The New York Times. Because of the public appetite for the show, it was expanded from 25 to 38 episodes in its second season. The series spawned a movie, concert tours, compilation albums, an interactive video game, associated merchandise and a spin-off series called American Juniors, while Newsweek reported on foreign versions of the show in more than a dozen countries. The album by first season winner Kelly Clarkson, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts in April of 2003. By the end of the second season, Jackson felt confident enough about the integrity of the judging process and public vote to laud the show's contribution. "This gives me hope for music," he told Newsweek. "It could be the start of a music business where it's based on talent, like it was in the '60s and '70s."American Idol propelled Jackson firmly into the public consciousness. Although he never became a media darling like the acerbic, controversial Cowell, Jackson became a household name. Some commentators poked gentle fun at Jackson's way of speaking: Newsweek suggested that the most notable change in season two was that "Randy, Randy, Randy has stopped saying names in triplicate and adopted a new verbal tic--Dawg." Described by Newsweek as "the least high maintenance of the three judges," Jackson was praised for his amiable, laid back approach to American Idol. Simon Cowell was quoted in People magazine as saying: "Randy is the only person on this show ... who has remained totally and utterly unaffected by it."Continued to ProduceJackson, who has taught A&R classes at UCLA, continued to work as a music producer throughout his commitments to American Idol. He recently produced vocals on a duet between Mariah Carey and Justin Timberlake, and made a personal appearance in the music video for Carey's song "Bringin' on the Heartbreak." Describing bass playing as "therapy" (to People magazine), Jackson still chose to play at occasional studio sessions, including Kelly Clarkson's debut, Thankful.Jackson manages his own artists, including former child star and singer Nikka Costa, and singer-songwriter Van Hunt, with whom he co-produced Dionne Farris' 1997 hit song "Hopeless." In addition to his television appearances as a judge on American Idol, Jackson was a presenter at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards and, in the same year, made a guest appearance on the Wayne Brady Show. He also appeared on British television in 2003, on alternative variety show Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway.Randy Jackson has been married twice. He divorced his first wife, singer-songwriter Elizabeth Jackson, in 1990, and married former ballet dancer, Erika Riker, in 1995. He has one daughter, Taylor, from his first marriage, and two children, Zoe and Jordan, from his second. In interviews, he is eager to correct the impression that he is related to either musical superstar Michael Jackson (who has a brother named Randy) or actor Samuel L. Jackson. He lives in Tarzana, a suburb of Los Angeles.

A music industry insider for more than 30 years, Randy Jackson has performed in a range of styles and produced and guided the careers of a multitude of stars. He has channeled his endless energy and depth of knowledge to enhance the recognition of one the most popular reality shows of the 2000s, American Idol. The show tests the star quality of wannabe singers as they face the judges, including Jackson, and the television audience. The show has made Jackson a celebrity, taking him from his decades of behind-the-scenes work and putting his beaming smile and hearty laugh in front of millions of viewers. Jackson explained his satisfaction with his work on American Idol to Jeanne McDowell of Time, "It's the best job ever. It never gets old for me."Born Randall Darius Jackson on June 23, 1956, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Jackson's father worked for Exxon and his mother was a homemaker. He took an early interest in music, which would seem likely in a region spilling over with a diverse range of styles. Growing up, Jackson was exposed to blues, jazz, and zydeco as well as fusion and rock music. He started out playing saxophone but eventually settled in with bass playing. During high school he managed to play football but also play music at night in places around town. When he was 17 years old he was playing in the band John Fred and the Playboys. The group enjoyed a modicum of success in 1967 with "Judy in Disguise (with Glasses)," a parody of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" by the British pop band the Beatles.After graduation Jackson attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, but his talent as a musician was quickly recognized by Billy Cobham, one of the best fusion drummers in the world. Cobham was visiting the Southern University campus and was impressed with Jackson's ability. He asked Jackson to join his band. Jackson left school and toured with Cobham for the next three years. He also worked with jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, recording three albums with him. After years of touring, Jackson eventually felt he needed to settle down and start getting some work outside the arena of jazz.In the 1980s, Jackson became a session musician in Los Angeles and found himself in demand working for a number of popular artists. Most of this work came to him through his association with Narada Michael Walden, a drummer and songwriter from the jazz fusion scene, who had established a production company in San Francisco. When Bruce Springsteen split for a short time from longtime backup band the E Street Band, Jackson stepped in on bass for the albums Lucky Town and Human Touch. Other artists he recorded with include Canadian pop star Celine Dion and American pop diva Madonna. He is a longtime pal of Mariah Carey, whom he met when she was a teenager. He worked with her on her 2002 comeback album Charmbracelet.During the 1990s, Jackson took on yet another role in the music business and stepped up to become vice president of artists and repertoire for Columbia Records. He held that position for eight years before moving on to MCA Records, where he became senior vice president of artists and repertoire. In that time, he helped find new talent while also figuring out ways to market them to audiences. With all his experience and know-how, he was perfectly prepared for the next step in his career.In the early 2000s, Jackson was shown a copy of the British basis for American Idol called Pop Idols. He enjoyed the show and agreed to become one of three judges for the American version. During his tenure as judge, Jackson has provided balance to overly cynical and snide comments from fellow judge Simon Cowell and the extremely enthusiastic Paula Abdul. His term "dawg" has become synonymous with his laid-back enthusiasm and down-to-earth advice for contestants.Jackson has been married twice. He has a daughter, Taylor, from his first marriage to Elizabeth Jackson. In 1995, Jackson married Erika Riker, with whom he has a daughter, Zoe, and a son, Jordan. In 2001, Jackson was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. He immediately changed his diet and began exercising but felt the changes were taking too long to have an effect. In 2003, he opted to undergo gastric bypass surgery. The resulting weight loss added up to more than 100 pounds.In early 2008, Jackson brought together a number of talents to create Randy Jackson's Music Club, Vol. 1. He explained to Shirley Halperin of Entertainment Weekly, "It's kind of a Quincy Jones record with all sorts—country, pop, hip-hop, R&B, jazz songs." Jackson's fellow judge, Paula Abdul, performed the first single from the album, "Dance Like There's No Tomorrow." Other performers include pop star Mariah Carey, country music star Travis Tritt, guitarist and songwriter Richie Sambora from the rock band Bon Jovi, European pop singer Barbi Esco, and newcomer Kelli Selah.Not one to rest for long, Jackson worked throughout 2007 putting together the reality show America's Best Dance Crew. In 2008, the first season of the show was incredibly popular. That same year saw Jackson heading into his seventh season as a judge on American Idol. He also hosts a weekly radio countdown show called "Randy Jackson's Hit List." Debuting in 2005 on the Westwood One radio network, Jackson's show airs for three hours, during which he shares music he enjoys. He explained to BMI.com, "[T]here's no better way to reach the music listener than through radio."Jackson has his own production company, Dream Merchant 21, at Warner Brothers where he develops shows, both reality and scripted. Dream Merchant 21 is also his recording company, which he used to launch his first record. Seemingly not able to rest on any of his numerous laurels, Jackson wrote a book, What's Up Dawg?: How to Become a Superstar in the Music Business, in 2003 to help new talent find their way in the music business. He has also tested his acting skills in episodes of the television shows Kevin Hill and Dr. Vegas.A strong desire to give back to the community leads Jackson to donate his time and name to many causes. He has toured and spoken for the American Heart Association and the Million Cat Rescue. He is an ambassador for the United States arm of Save the Children. He also started a foundation with his wife, Erika, called the Randy Jackson Family Foundation, which focuses on fighting childhood obesity.When discussing the music industry in particular, Jackson admits it's hard to succeed. He explained to  MSNBC.com, "[T]he journey to get anywhere near the top is really hard. In order to keep on that road, you have to have a pretty strong interior and exterior." Jackson must be one strong person having successfully navigated the music industry for more than 30 years. His work has appeared on more than 1,000 high sales records, including gold and multiplatinum albums. All told his work as a musician and an executive has figured in the sales of more than 200 albums that have sold over a million copies. He played a major, yet invisible, role in American popular music for two decades. Since American Idol he has expanded his role while enjoying the perks of being a recognizable celebrity.

Randall Darius "Randy" Jackson (born June 23, 1956) is an American bassist, singer, record producer, entrepreneur and television personality. He is best known as a judge on American Idol and executive producer for MTV's America's Best Dance Crew. Jackson has won a Grammy Award as a producer.[1]
Jackson was born on June 23, 1956, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,[2] His first marriage, to Elizabeth Jackson, was dissolved in 1990; they had one daughter named Taylor.[3] In 1995, Jackson married Erika Riker, with whom he has two children, a 14-year-old daughter named Zoe and a 12-year-old son named Jordan. In 2003, Jackson lost 114 pounds (52 kg) following gastric bypass surgery. He stated in a February 2008 television commercial that he has type 2 diabetes.[4]
Jackson played in bands with Carlos Santana and Jerry Garcia. In the early 1980s he played on three albums for Jean-Luc Ponty and with the rock band Taxxi. From 1986 to 1987 he was a session musician for the rock group Journey. Jackson played on Journey's 1986 album Raised on Radio. He moved to Italy in the late 1980s and played on a record by Italian pop star Zucchero. The record, Zucchero and the Randy Jackson Band, was produced by Corrado Rustici who played guitar with Jackson on many albums in the early 1980s. He also played with Billy Cobham.
In 1985, Keith Richards was asked to provide music for the Whoopi Goldberg comedy vehicle Jumpin' Jack Flash. Richards assembled an all-star band which included Aretha Franklin on piano and lead vocals and Jackson on bass guitar. This song was the fourth track on Aretha's 1986 album titled Aretha. Jackson can be seen in the song's video.
In the late 1980s, Jackson was still doing sessions. He was notably on the first solo album by famed session guitarist Steve Lukather. Jackson was a featured bass guitarist on five songs on Maze's 1989 "Silky Soul" album. He also performed on several of Kenny G's albums.
Jackson was the bass guitarist on the 1991 self-titled Divinyls album (which features the song "I Touch Myself") as well as featured bassist on several tracks of Tracy Chapman's 1992 release, Matters of the Heart. He performed on the singles "Bang Bang Bang", "Open Arms", and "Dreaming on a World". That same year, Jackson also played bass on Bruce Springsteen's hit "Human Touch."
Jackson has recorded, produced, or toured with many well-known artists and bands, ranging from Mariah Carey (he has worked with her throughout her career, been her musical director for a number of her tours; he has formed part of her band during numerous performances including Live 8 in London in 2005) to 'N Sync, Whitney Houston, (produced) Dionne Farris' (critically acclaimed debut CD, Wild-Seed Wild-Flower), Céline Dion, Fergie (dating back to her days in Wild Orchid), Stryper,[5] and Madonna (he played some bass on her album "Like a Prayer" although not on the single of the same name).
Jackson played numerous times in Jean-Luc Ponty's backing band. His credits as a session musician range from playing with Aldo Nova, Blue Öyster Cult, Jon Bon Jovi, Michael Bolton, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, Billy Cobham, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Herbie Hancock, Ernie Isley, Billy Joel, Brent Bourgeois, Journey, Richard Marx, George Michael, Stevie Nicks, Imogen Heap, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Waters to playing at the Grand Ole Opry with The Charlie Daniels Band. His production/songwriting work in the San Francisco Bay Area with Narada Michael Walden and Walter Afanasieff led Jackson to be in demand as a producer as well.
On March 11, 2008, Jackson released an album produced entirely by himself, titled Randy Jackson's Music Club, Vol. 1. The album's release was preceded by the single "Dance Like There's No Tomorrow" sung by Paula Abdul. In 2009, Randy began working with former Idol finalist Kimberley Locke, producing her 4th album. The lead single, "Strobe Light", was released March 16, 2010.[6] In February 2010, Jackson participated in We Are the World 25 for Haiti as part of the chorus.[citation needed]
Jackson is the manager for the Charlotte-based band Paper Tongues. With the help of Jackson, they signed with a major label, A&M/Octone Records. He has also worked as an executive, spending eight years as vice president of artists and repertoire (A&R) at Columbia Records and four years heading A&R at MCA Records.
Starting back in 2002, Jackson is one of the panel judges on the Fox Network reality television series American Idol, along with Paula Abdul (2002–2009), Simon Cowell (2002–2010), Kara DioGuardi (2009–2010), Ellen DeGeneres (2010), Jennifer Lopez (2011–2012) and Steven Tyler (2011–2012). As a result of Cowell's departure, Jackson is left as the sole original judge on American Idol. His role was originally going to be reduced to that of a mentor, so the 2013 season will have all new judges,[7] but it was later decided that he will remain as a judge for season 12.[8]
Jackson also hosts a radio top 40 countdown known as Randy Jackson's Hit List,[9] which is syndicated by Westwood One.[10] Every week, Jackson counts down his top 30 Urban AC and Mainstream AC hits. He also gives behind-the-scenes information on American Idol on the internet radio station Artist Underground.
Jackson produces America's Best Dance Crew, an American group dance competition and reality television show, which premiered on February 7, 2008 on MTV and is scheduled to return for its sixth season in April 2011. Each week, the teams showcase their creative talents in choreography and their dance skills, and one crew is eliminated by the judges. The competition continues until the sole winning dance crew is awarded the title of America's Best Dance Crew, and a cash prize of $100,000.[11] Jackson has admitted to using the show as a platform for his banner-making company.[citation needed]

American Idol: Which Singer Made Keith Urban Throw His Chair?May 14, 2014 10:44 PM ETby Liz RafteryAmerican Idol celebrated its 500th (!) episode Wednesday night, with tributes throughout the broadcast from past winners.

Did anyone go the sabotage route, or was everyone altruistic?
The show finally finds something for Randy Jackson to do, as he introduces the theme of the night and interviews each singer about what they would select for their counterparts. (Everyone seems to be playing nice, for the record.)

American Idol headed to Tinseltown in Week 3, with the Top 11 choosing their favorite songs from movie soundtracks to perform.
This week is important because only the Top 10 finalists will be included on the Idol summer tour, meaning that whoever gets eliminated Thursday will be left in the dust. Before the singing starts, however...
Let me start by saying that all the contestants on Season 13 of American Idol seem like truly lovely people. And also that I'd rather watch the green paint dry on that house in True Detective than sit through another 11 weeks of performances from this crew.
And apparently, I'm not alone. Idol's ratings have (once again) been in steady decline this season and hit an all-time low a couple of weeks ago with the Feb. 20 episode. Granted, the show faced stiff competition early on this year from the Winter Olympics, but its post-Olympics numbers remain languid.
Let me just start by saying that of the American Idol-watching editors at TVGuide.com, I'm the MK Nobilette fan. Therefore, it pains me to say that she wasn't very good in her first live performance as a finalist.
Did American Idol's Top 13 rise to the occasion?  Monday was the official debut of the Top 13 finalists and apparently, the debut of voting  at the top of the hour. The night's theme is "This Is Me," which we take to mean we can totally psychoanalyze the singers by their song choice. Will anyone dare to do "Billionaire"?
