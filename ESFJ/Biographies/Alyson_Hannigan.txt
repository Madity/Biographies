Alyson Lee Hannigan (born March 24, 1974)[1] is an American actress. She is best known for her roles as Willow Rosenberg in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003), Lily Aldrin on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother (2005–2014) and Michelle Flaherty in the American Pie film series (1999–present).[2]
Hannigan was born in Washington, D.C.,[2] the only child of Emilie (Posner) Haas, a real estate agent,[3] and Al Hannigan, a truck driver.[4] Her father is of Irish descent and her mother is Jewish.[5][6] Her parents divorced when she was two and she was raised mostly by her mother in Atlanta, Georgia.[7]
At age four, Hannigan began appearing in commercials.[8] She moved to Hollywood at age 11.[3] Living with her mother and attending North Hollywood High School, she successfully auditioned for agents while visiting her father in Santa Barbara. After attending North Hollywood High School, she attended California State University, Northridge where she earned a degree in psychology.[9]
Hannigan's first major film role was in My Stepmother Is an Alien,[2] a science fiction comedy released in 1988; one of her co-stars in the film was actor Seth Green, who later joined her in the regular cast of Buffy as her on-screen boyfriend. Then in 1989, her first regular role on a TV series came when she was cast in the short-lived ABC sitcom Free Spirit. As a teenager, Hannigan babysat for the kids of Bob Saget, who later narrated her TV series, How I Met Your Mother.[10]
In 1997, Hannigan was cast to play Willow Rosenberg, Buffy Summers' best friend, on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[11] The show became a success, and Hannigan gained recognition, subsequently appearing in several notable films aimed at teenage audiences, including American Pie, American Pie 2, Boys and Girls and American Wedding.[2] She also had a guest spot on the Buffy spin-off, Angel, reprising her role of Willow in a few episodes (including most notably "Orpheus," during the fourth season of Angel and the seventh season of Buffy), but none after Buffy finished production.
In early 2004, Hannigan made her West End debut, starring in a stage adaptation of When Harry Met Sally... at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, opposite Luke Perry.[12] In 2005, Hannigan returned to starring in a regular television series, appearing in the hit comedy How I Met Your Mother as Lily, and also playing a recurring guest role on Veronica Mars as Trina Echolls.[13] In February 2006, Hannigan starred as Julia Jones in Date Movie, a parody of romantic comedies.[2] She was also a guest star on the ABC animated sitcom The Goode Family in 2009.[14]
Hannigan joined forces with Emily Deschanel, Jaime King, Minka Kelly, and Katharine McPhee in a "video slumber party" featured on FunnyorDie.com to promote regular breast cancer screenings for the organization Stand Up 2 Cancer.[15]
Hannigan married fellow Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor Alexis Denisof at Two Bunch Palms Resort in Desert Hot Springs, California, on October 11, 2003. The couple have two daughters, Satyana Marie Denisof, born March 24, 2009, also Hannigan's birthday,[1] and Keeva Jane Denisof, born May 23, 2012.[17] Hannigan and her husband are godparents to Joss Whedon's son, Arden.[18]
On February 13, 2013, Hannigan was granted a temporary restraining order against New Hampshire resident John Hobbs after he began sending her threatening and obsessive messages via the Internet, wishing to meet and possibly kill her. On March 6, 2013, the restraining order was extended to last for an additional 4 years.[19]

      "It was great for a change to share a week's work, rather than being on different projects. With the hours Alexis and I spend on set, you can tend to pass like ships in the night. Weekends, however, are great because we can share precious time together. But when we're at home, I promise you, we certainly don't talk about vampires or suck each other's blood for tea" [on playing the season 4, episode 15, role of "Willow" as a crossover on Angel (1999) June 4, 2003].

I had butterflies in my stomach. I don't know why I was so nervous -- maybe because I don't know how to pronounce half the lines I have to say today. They're in some made-up language".
      It's like walking around a history book. You have all these beautiful buildings that were built before 1980. - on London.
      Nerds are far more interesting human in later life. - on the varying times of "blossoming" for individuals.
      Asked in a May 6, 2003, interview by Fred Topel what might be her final thoughts on playing Willow Rosenberg, Hannigan answered, "Oh, I'm going to miss everything. It's been the most amazing and significant job of my life obviously and I'll always have it near and dear to my heart. I'm so grateful and appreciative that I worked with the best crew and the best writers and producers and cast and I love them all." The follow-up interview question was: "What would you like the fans to do with an extra hour in their schedule?" Hannigan replied firmly: "Read."
      [She was asked in a May 6, 2003 interview by Fred Topel how she developed the "Willow voice"] I sort of got her voice when I was auditioning. I was sitting in the parking lot looking at the material, and I didn't have it, I didn't have it. Then there was one particular line which, from there on, I was like, "Okay, I know how I want to play this character."

You've invested nine years in this show and if Mrs. Mosby has been sleeping with the fishes all this time, as it was heavily implied last week, it feels cheap, disappointing, lazy and manipulative.

Alyson and Alexis Denisof became engaged on Christmas 2002 and were married on Saturday, October 11 2003
Alyson: (on her 2011 pregnancy rumor) NO, I'm not pregnant! I just ate too much carnival food, that time of the month, hurt my back & couldn't suck my gut in, & need 2 do cardio!
Alyson: (On the finale of How I Met Your Mother) The writers on our show always have a lots of things up their sleeves for the season finale.
Alyson: (on motherhood) Motherhood has changed me completely for the better, and I really think it has taught me to slow down and try to go at her pace as much as I can.
Alyson: (on the possible Buffy reboot with Joss Whedon) A BUFFY movie without Joss, I would crap on that. Joss was Buffy.
Alyson: Have you ever had sex on the Buffy set? No. Some of the other crew members have, but I'm not saying who.
Alyson: (on her daughter Sati) Satyana said "Oppsy daisy" this morning. How am I suppose to handle this level of cuteness?!?
Alyson: (about getting away for the night) It doesn't really even matter what you do, it's just that you're doing it. There's something really lovely about saying 'she's with the babysitter and I'm closing the door.
Alyson: (when asked how often a Mom should take a break) Every night! I'm just kidding. Needs and should are different! My husband and I are really trying to be good about date night. So once a week we get a babysitter and we go, even if it's just go to dinner. Just to know that you have that to look forward to is such a gift.
Alyson: (talking about a certain late night host) Certain hosts have you do your pre-interview and then you have to go on the show and retell every story verbatim or you're not coming back. Every show is different that way. I'm not saying who, but it's not Jimmy's.
Alyson: (when did she knew she wanted to act) Just from the moment I was born, I knew this is what I wanted to do. So I was lucky that way. But I absolutely had a wonderful teacher in high school. Her name was Mrs. Horn. She was the English and drama teacher. She was so supportive and encouraging and went above and beyond.
Alyson: (On the seaon finale of How I Met Your Mother) You'll get some pieces to the puzzle, and you'll get more empty spaces to the puzzle. And the baby talk is back on the table because that got sidetracked after the death of Marshall's father. But I think the fans will be really happy because it will be satisfying and frustrating all at the same time, which is what you want out of a season finale.
Alyson: (on keeping her daughter distracted) Exactly. Funny voices help, but she's smart, so I have to constantly come up with new ones. It takes a really funny voice to keep her from doing somersaults.
Alyson: (On her daughter Sati) Sati is hilarious all the time. She has a great sense of humor. She knows she's funny, too. Like whenever she does something cute, she gets this smile on her face and announces, "Funny baby!"
Alyson: (What she loves to have as a mother) Give me a good wet wipe and I'll be happy! And, I know this is terrible for the environment, but they now make sunscreen wet wipes and those have been coming in handy. Unfortunately, my daughter inherited my pale skin, so those are fantastic!
Alyson: (On motherhood) You are eating something that has just been spit out of a child's mouth – and not flinching at all!
Alyson: (on Mother's Day) My husband's so good at spoiling me. He'll have some special tricks up his sleeve. I'm just saying I hope it involves sleeping-in and hopefully maybe some kind of breakfast in bed. But honestly, as long as I'm with my husband and my daughter, it's going to be a great day.
Alyson: (on shooting the kiss scene with Amber Benson) After one take Joss did say, "Can we have one that's less like you're going to sleep together in about five minutes?"
Alyson: My husband, Alexis, is my favorite souvenir from my time working on Buffy The Vampire Slayer. We should've gotten married after the first date - I mean, we knew then.
Alyson: When I got to L.A., I would walk around with my head held high, just waiting to be discovered.
Alyson: (about filming How I Met Your Mother) I miss the intensity and drama of Buffy, but feel lucky to be on a set where all day long we just make each other laugh.
Alyson: (about ending Buffy the Vampire Slayer) We've known for a while even though nothing has been said. I think everybody is pretty much feeling it was a good run and it's time to go.
Alyson: (Alyson on being presumed dead) There was a rumor that I was dead. I happened to be off work that day and I had a beeper and the batteries had died so I was just shopping and looking round book stores. People were frantically trying to get in touch with me and people were calling hospitals and the news, people were calling my agent trying to see if it was true, and I got home and my voice mail was filled with people going, "Call me if you're ok" - and I was completely oblivious.
Alyson: (Alyson on filming an Angel episode with husband Alexis Denisof.) It was great for a change to share a week's work, rather than being on different projects. With the hours Alexis and I spend on set you can tend to pass like ships in the night. Weekends, however, are great because we can share precious time together. But when we're at home, I promise you, we certainly don't talk about vampires or suck each other's blood for tea.
Alyson: I know quickly whether a guy is boyfriend material. If I can have a good time doing absolutely nothing with him, then that's boyfriend material for me. Like if we're able to have fun at a gas station. I've had some really good times at gas stations.
Alyson: (Alyson on her time on Buffy the Vampire Slayer) It's been the most amazing and signigicant job of my life, obviously, and I'll always have it near to me heart.
Alyson: (Alyson on being nervous with some Buffy the Vampire Slayer lines that were in Latin) I had butterflies in my stomach. I don't know why I was so nervous-maybe because I don't know how to pronounce half the lines I have to say today. They're in some made-up language.
Alyson: (Alyson talking about her fans) It's great that they're devoted. But, it makes you a little paranoid too, wondering how they're gonna interpret every little thing you do.
Alyson: I love this profession, but God, it can just destroy people, and I don't want that to happen and become some monster.
Alyson: This is what I always wanted to do in my entire life, so I am not going to sit here and complain that it is so terrible to be in successful movies, because it becomes a trilogy!
well, for sure the first thing that comes in mind: she was brilliant as Willow in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" -- she made me smile or cry in almost every her scene, and the way she portrayed her character... it's hard to believe that we could have some other Willow!  but Willow is not the only reason to love Alyson Hannigan: she is the cutie kid from "My Stepmother is an Alien", she is the crazy Michelle from "American Pie" thrilogy with the catchphrase "This one time, at the band she is hilarious Lily from "How I Met Your Mother", and she's so much more -- nice, cute, awesome person.  sometimes you feel like you know her but then she surprises you with smth and you start admire her even more, though you think "more" is impossible! few days ago I watched "Beyond the City Limits" -- and the character Aly played there was SOOO not her. and I liked it SOOO much (even though the movie didn't impress me). I wish we had the opportunity to see her on screen more often.moreless
I usually don't find many different actresses that funny. In fact most actresses I claim of being "funny" really are more "goofy" than "funny". And I didn't like Alyson's character for two episodes on my previous favorite show, That '70s Show, but as I have continued to watch How I Met Your Mother, my eyes have been opened. Alyson Hannigan is an amazing actress, funny too, and don't forget beautiful. She does have that "goofiness" attribute as well, but in a definite good way. I'm sorry I ever doubted her just because of her character as Sally the police officer in two episodes of That '70s Show.moreless
