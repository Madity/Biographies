Regis Philbin (/ˈriːdʒɨs ˈfɪlbɨn/; born August 25, 1931) is an American media personality, actor and singer, known for hosting talk and game shows since the 1960s.[3] Sometimes called (alternatively attributed to James Brown) "the hardest working man in show business",[4][5] he holds the Guinness World Record for the most time spent in front of a television camera.[6] His trademarks include his excited manner, his Bronx accent, his wit, and irreverent ad-libs.
Philbin is most widely known as the host of the New York City-based nationally syndicated talk show Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee starting in 1988, which became Live! with Regis and Kelly starting in 2001 and continued until Philbin's departure in 2011.[7][8][9]
Philbin has also hosted Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,[9] Million Dollar Password,[10] and the first season of America's Got Talent.[11]
Philbin hosted Crowd Goes Wild, a daily sports talk show on Fox Sports 1, from it's launch in August 2013, to its cancellation in May 2014.
Regis Francis Xavier Philbin[1][2] was born in the Bronx, New York City. His father, Francis "Frank" Philbin, a U.S. Marine who served in the Pacific, was of Irish heritage.[12] His mother, Filomena "Florence" (née Boscia), was of Arbëreshë descent. They lived in the Van Nest section of the Bronx.[13] Philbin was raised Roman Catholic.[12] He was supposedly named "Regis" because his father wanted him to attend the prestigious Regis High School. It was long believed that Philbin was an only child, but on the February 1, 2007, broadcast of Live with Regis and Kelly, Philbin announced that he did have a brother, Frank M. Philbin (March 1, 1951 – January 27, 2007), who had died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma several days earlier.[14] Philbin said his brother, 20 years younger than he, had asked to not be mentioned on television or in the press.[15]
Philbin attended Our Lady of Solace grammar school in the Bronx,[16] and graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School[1] in the Bronx in 1949 before attending the University of Notre Dame, where he graduated in 1953 with a sociology degree.[14] He later served in the United States Navy as a supply officer, then went through a few behind-the-scenes jobs in television and radio before moving into the broadcasting arena.[14]
In his earliest show business work, Philbin was a page at The Tonight Show in the 1950s.[17] Later, he wrote for Los Angeles talk show host Tom Duggan, and nervously filled in one night when the hard-drinking Duggan didn't show up.[17][18] He also was an announcer on The Tonight Show in 1962.[3] In 1957, Regis left his job as assistant news editor to Baxter Ward at KCOP, Los Angeles to make his fortune in New York. His replacement at KCOP was George Van Valkenburg.
His first talk show was The Regis Philbin Show[1] on KOGO-TV (now KGTV) in San Diego, California. For budgetary reasons, he had no writing staff, leading him to begin each show with what has become his hallmark, the "host chat" segment (influenced by Jack Paar), where he engages his audience (and later on, his co-host) in discussions about his life and the day's events.
Philbin gained his first national exposure in 1967 as Joey Bishop's sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show[19] on television (1967–1969). In a Johnny Carson-Ed McMahon vein, Bishop would playfully tease Philbin and Philbin would take the barbs in stride. Philbin, however, got his feelings wounded when he learned from the network grapevine that ABC executives were dissatisfied with his work and his thick accent. In response, Philbin, during the opening of one of the programs in 1968, suddenly stopped the show with an unplanned diatribe about 'not being wanted and letting down" the program and abruptly quit on air. A few nights later, assured by Bishop that all was well and the barbs were not personal, Philbin returned. As revealed in Regis' book, How I Got This Way, this was actually all a ruse planned by Bishop and Regis to steal the spotlight and attract some of Johnny Carson's viewers. When The Joey Bishop Show was canceled, Bishop returned the favor and walked off the show on the air unannounced, leaving Philbin to successfully carry the night on his own.
In 1964, Philbin took over the show that replaced The Steve Allen Show when Steve Allen left the show.[20] The audience did not accept Philbin as a replacement for the zany antics of Allen and the appearance lasted only a few weeks because of dismal ratings. Johnny Carson was too strong in the ratings for the same time slot. Carson was an inspiration for Philbin, according to his own words (PBS, 2008, Pioneers of Television).[citation needed]
From 1975 to 1981, he co-hosted A.M. Los Angeles, a local morning talk show on KABC-TV,[21] first with Sarah Purcell (1975 to 1978), then with Cyndy Garvey (1978 to 1981).[21] Philbin's presence brought the show from the bottom of the local ratings to No. 1.[22]
During the early 1970s, Philbin also commuted each weekend to St. Louis, where he filmed Regis Philbin's Saturday Night in St. Louis[21] on KMOX-TV (now KMOV).
In 1981, Philbin and Mary Hart co-hosted a national morning variety series for NBC. The show lasted 18 weeks.[23]
After Garvey left Los Angeles in 1982 and moved to New York City,[21] Philbin rejoined her on The Morning Show,[21] on WABC-TV.[21] At the time, the 9 am time slot for WABC suffered from low Nielsen ratings because of competition from WNBC-TV's Donahue and WCBS-TV's game show block featuring The Joker's Wild and Tic Tac Dough. After Garvey left again, and Ann Abernathy briefly shared co-hosting duties, Philbin was paired with Kathie Lee Johnson (later Gifford), in June 1985, and ratings improved significantly. The show became nationally syndicated in September 1988 as Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee[21] and the success continued. The program replaced A.M. Los Angeles upon its cancellation in 1991 and was eventually picked up by all of the ABC owned-and-operated stations except for WLS in Chicago, which aired The Oprah Winfrey Show in that time slot and had done so since the show's debut as A.M. Chicago.
When Gifford departed in 2000,[25] the show was temporarily named Live! with Regis.[25] Philbin had guest co-hosts until a replacement was found.[25] Philbin won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 2001.[25] Kelly Ripa was chosen as the permanent co-host in 2001, and the show was renamed Live! with Regis and Kelly.[25] Their chemistry proved to be successful as the show continued to enjoy high ratings.[citation needed]
Philbin set a Guinness World Record for "Most Hours on Camera" on his August 20, 2004, Live show (replacing Hugh Downs), which gave him a total of 15,188 hours on television.[6] On the September 14, 2006, episode of Live, his record was updated to 15,662 hours.[26] His on-air time continues to accumulate.
In 2008, Philbin's contract with ABC was renewed through 2011.[27] Under this contract, Philbin reportedly earned more than US$21 million. He received a similar contract with CBS for hosting Million Dollar Password).[27]
It was announced on the September 17, 2009, episode of Live with Regis and Kelly during their World Record Breaker week, that Philbin's Guinness Book World Record for most time spent in front of a TV camera had reached 16,343 hours.
Philbin was also a game show host. He hosted The Neighbors, a short-lived game show on ABC from late-1975 to early-1976. The show had two female contestants guessing which of her three women neighbors said gossipy things about her.[3] In 1976, he was a "field reporter" for ABC's Almost Anything Goes, an American adaptation of the British game show, It's a Knockout. Both shows suffered from poor ratings.[citation needed]
Philbin was the original host of the U.S. version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, an ABC game show that had its roots in Britain. Millionaire was a big ratings success in its 1999 debut, when it was intended as an occasional special series. ABC aired Millionaire as a regular series with frequent episodes, but its viewership slowly declined. After Millionaire was canceled, it was retooled in 2002 as a syndicated series hosted by Meredith Vieira, which continues today. ABC brought back Millionaire in 2004 with Philbin, retitled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire, a related series that was aired on a more limited basis. Philbin had appeared in 11 episodes of a special edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, which started on August 9, 2009, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the show.[28] He also was a celebrity contestant in this version. Millionaire, in its syndicated format, uses guest hosts for selected weeks during the season and Philbin hosted a week of episodes that aired in November 2009, coinciding with his 2009 surgery.
Philbin's Millionaire hosting duties won him a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host in 2001, and later, in a 2007 Time article, he was listed among the 15 Best Game Show Hosts in History.[29] When Millionaire was honored on GSN's Gameshow Hall of Fame special, Philbin's tenure as the show's host was praised. Leigh Hampton, then executive producer of the syndicated version, said that he "[knew] when to take rein of it and when to sit back and let the contestant be the contestant,"[30] and Jennifer Slater of twogirlsandatv.com called him "the sweetest man on television."[30] Philbin himself recalled his own Millionaire tenure on said special with the following statement:
You could only have a minute or two with it before the questions began. I did everything I could to make them more available for the right answer.[30]
In November 2005, ABC announced that Philbin would host the network's revival of This Is Your Life. In August 2006, he reported that his option on the contract for the show had lapsed and he declined to renew it.[31]
Philbin hosted the first season of America's Got Talent, a Simon Cowell-produced amateur talent search show on NBC, during the summer of 2006. He flew between New York City and Los Angeles during that time period to participate in both Live with Regis and Kelly and AGT. Because of his difficulty with commuting cross country and his health problems, he was replaced in 2007 by talk show host Jerry Springer.[32] In regards to filling Philbin's spot, Springer noted that "no one fills in for Regis. He's the best there ever was at this so you pay homage to him."[33]
Philbin's affiliation with FremantleMedia started to develop at this time. He hosted a revival of the Password franchise entitled Million Dollar Password, which premiered June 1, 2008, and ended in 2009.[34]
On December 31, 2004, Philbin filled in for Dick Clark on ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, as Clark was recovering from a stroke. Philbin (who is a year and a half younger than Clark) lightheartedly claimed to have interrupted his previously planned vacation to do the show.[35] During CNN's New Year's Eve special, hosted by Anderson Cooper and broadcast on both CNN and CNN International, revelers in Times Square told CNN reporter Jason Carroll that Philbin was "all right" filling in for Clark, though they had Cooper and Carroll.[36]
Philbin was also the host of the finale of The Apprentice 2 on December 16, 2004,[37] and the official 30-minute red carpet arrivals at the 80th Academy Awards ceremony on February 24, 2008.[38]
Philbin makes regular guest appearances on Late Show with David Letterman.[40] He is often introduced by Letterman as "Regis Lee Philbin", a play on his former morning co-host, Kathie Lee Gifford. He has also appeared on other late night talk shows, such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
Philbin has appeared on the sitcoms Spin City, How I Met Your Mother, Mad About You, Hope & Faith, Seinfeld, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, as well as the sketch comedy program, The Dana Carvey Show, and The Larry Sanders Show.
Philbin was a celebrity guest at WrestleMania VII in Los Angeles in 1991, commenting on the main event between Hulk Hogan and Sgt. Slaughter.
In 1998, Philbin made an appearance in Disney's Hercules as the voice of the mythical monster Typhon. Kathie Lee Grifford was also present as the voice of Typhon's mate, Echidna.
On December 25, 2000, Philbin appeared as a panelist on the first season championship game of the ESPN game show 2 Minute Drill.
On May 15, 2006, Philbin appeared as a special guest, alongside Howie Mandel, for a two-hour special episode of Deal or No Deal on NBC.
Philbin has appeared three times on Celebrity Jeopardy!, the most appearances for any competing celebrity on the game show Jeopardy!. He played for Cardinal Hayes High School, his alma mater. In November 2006, he won his competition and earned $50,000 for the school.[41]
Philbin appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? in November 2007. He again played for his alma mater, Cardinal Hayes High School. He dropped out of the game and went home with $175,000 for the school.
In September 2008, Philbin guest starred as himself on How I Met Your Mother,[42] where he joined the cast in the search for New York's best hamburger. The show revealed that he worked out at Barney's gym. During the best hamburger hunt, his picture hung in the "Best Burger" restaurant, and every other suspected best burger restaurant, such as Corner Bistro and Veggie Heaven. In the show, he hosted a "show within a show" called Million Dollar Heads or Tails, which referred to both Million Dollar Password and Millionaire.
On December 25, 2009, Philbin attended Christmas Mass with Father Edward L. Beck and Timothy Dolan, the current Archbishop of New York, at The Sunday Mass[43] and gave a special interview discussing how being a Catholic had influenced his life.[44]
In February 2011, Philbin made an appearance on Take Two with Phineas and Ferb. On July 3, 2011, he was a celebrity guest on the The Marriage Ref, along with Tracy Morgan and Susie Essman.
On May 29, 2012, Philbin appeared on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight during the show's Guest Host Week. Philbin's guest was his long-time friend and fellow television host David Letterman.
In 2013, while Jon Stewart was absent from the Daily Show, Philbin made a guest appearance, and at the end of the interview, kissed guest-host John Oliver on the head.
Fox Sports announced on March 5, 2013, that Philbin will be hosting Crowd Goes Wild, a daily sports talk show featuring a panel of hosts on their all new national sports network Fox Sports 1, which launched on August 17, 2013. He will again partner with his producer from Millionaire, Michael Davies.[46][47]
Philbin is also an author and singer. His two autobiographies (with co-author Bill Zehme), I'm Only One Man! (1995) and Who Wants To Be Me? (2000), are written in the conversational or anecdotal style of his host chats. The former book follows a year (1994–1995) in his life recalling, among other things, his personal life, his memories with celebrities, and work on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. The latter book was a response to the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and deals with the show and his life.
As a singer, Philbin can best be described as a crooner in the style of his favorite singers: Dean Martin, Perry Como, and Frank Sinatra. He tested the musical waters with his 1968 pop vocal release, It's Time For Regis! After receiving poor reviews, Philbin was reluctant to record another studio album, but he occasionally sang on Live, usually in duet with another singer. After 36 years, he recorded When You're Smiling (2004), a more mature-sounding pop standards album. The Regis Philbin Christmas Album was released September 2005. This album features several duets, with close friend Donald Trump ("Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"), Steve Tyrell ("Marshmallow World"), and wife Joy ("Baby, It's Cold Outside" and "Winter Wonderland"). A special edition of the album was produced with tracks recorded with the Notre Dame Glee Club.[48] Philbin is signed on to Hollywood Records.[citation needed]
Philbin has been married twice and has four children. He was married to Catherine "Kay" Faylen, daughter of actor Frank Faylen, from 1955 to 1968, and he has been married to interior decorator Joy Senese since 1970. His children are Amy, Daniel (both with Faylen), Joanna, and Jennifer "J. J." (both with Senese). Joy Philbin occasionally co-hosted with her husband Regis. On Live, he often mentioned Joy, and to a lesser degree, Joanna, J.J., Amy, and Danny. When Danny was born, he didn't have some vertebrae and he was missing some muscles in his leg.[citation needed] He had to spend his childhood at the Angel View Crippled Children's Foundation in California. During the September 11 attacks, Philbin noted on air that he was very worried about Danny, who worked at The Pentagon and uses a wheelchair. Danny emerged from the terrorist attack safe, and since the tragedy Regis has joined Danny at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to visit injured troops.[citation needed] In August 2007, Regis and Joy Philbin announced that their daughter J. J. and her husband, Michael Schur, were expecting their first child in February 2008. William Xavier Schur was born on February 18, 2008. He weighed 6 lb. 5 oz., and was 19 inches in length. William Xavier is named after Regis, Xavier being his confirmation name. He is also nicknamed "Mr. Trouble" by Regis and often referred to as such on Live. At 7:54 p.m., on July 14, 2010, J.J. gave birth to a daughter, Ivy Elizabeth, in California.[citation needed] Philbin spends time between his home in Greenwich, Connecticut, and apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan across from the WABC-TV studios.
Philbin follows the professional sports world extensively, enjoying baseball as well as football. He is an avid fan of the New York Yankees and a proud supporter of the sports teams of his alma mater, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish – so proud, in fact, that Philbin narrated the two audio CDs that accompanied Joe Garner's book, Echoes of Notre Dame Football: Great and Memorable Moments of the Fighting Irish, and is unwilling to waver even when St. John's coach Steve Lavin offered a trade to gift him a pink t-shirt.[49] Philbin played on the Notre Dame tennis team (putting his recent statements in an ad where he claimed to have learned tennis from second wife Joy, in doubt). Notre Dame football coaches, such as Charlie Weis, Tyrone Willingham, and Lou Holtz have appeared on Live. Along with being a Yankees fan, Regis is also "keeping an eye on the Florida Marlins."[50] On May 5, 2009, he delivered the first pitch at a Marlins game. He has also supported the Pittsburgh Pirates in recent years as well.[51] During his Southern California years, he was a regular at parties at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion.
In March 1984, Philbin opened a Ford dealership in Gilbert, Arizona, as a side investment during his career in television. The dealership, Philbin Ford, suffered due to the already saturated auto market in the area, and was closed in late 1988.[52]
He is known to have trouble handling new technology and is frequently confused when operating electronics (such as remote controls and DVD players). He does not usually use computers (although he did use one for an episode of Live during summer 2008, demonstrating how to find homes online) and did not own a cell phone until September 10, 2008. It is often noted, however, that Philbin does not completely reject the technology; he simply has Joy make calls and send e-mails for him.[53]
Philbin had an angioplasty in 1993.[54] On March 14, 2007, he underwent triple bypass surgery at Weill Cornell Medical Center because of plaque in his arteries.[55] Prior to the surgery, Philbin talked with David Letterman, for whom Philbin had substituted on Late Show with David Letterman during Letterman's own quintuple bypass surgery.[55] Following Philbin's successful heart surgery, he returned to the show on April 26.
On December 1, 2009, Philbin had hip-replacement surgery.[56][57] He returned on Monday, January 4, 2010, to his regular hosting duties.[58]
In May, 2010, Philbin underwent surgery to have a blood clot removed from his calf. He returned to work the next day.[59]
He was cast as car salesman, Handsome Hal, on Kelly Ripa's sitcom Hope & Faith. He once played the piccolo in this role.
He was chosen as the voice of a minor female character in Shrek the Third: Mabel, the sister of the Ugly Stepsister (played by Larry King).
In the Animaniacs episode "Pigeon on a Roof" (a Goodfeathers musical parody of Fiddler on the Roof), a key plot element involves toppling a statue of Martin Scorsese—and replacing it with one of Philbin.
Also, several Hey Arnold! episodes would feature a talk show that parodied Regis and Kathie Lee. The male host, in addition, would always get extremely excited in a parody of Philbin.
Features in the How I Met Your Mother Episode: "The Best Burger in New York", with his picture being displayed in the background of all the burger restaurants.
During the successful first run of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Philbin popularized the monochromatic look in men's formalwear that emphasizes color rather than pattern in ties and dress shirts. His look was a suit, shirt and tie coordinated in solid, slightly varying shades of the same, usually dark or muted, color.[40] A Van Heusen clothing line based on this look, called Regis, was short-lived.[60]
When Philbin hosted Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, he used the phrase "Is that your final answer?" whenever he had to confirm a contestant's answer. Adopted from Chris Tarrant, this became Philbin's catch phrase during his tenure with the show.
In August 2009, Philbin returned for a two-week stint as host of Millionaire. The 11 shows (Sunday-to-Thursday twice, plus one extra Sunday) started airing August 9 on ABC primetime.
Philbin (along with Steve Harvey and John Henson) were named the 2009–10 guest hosts of the daily Millionaire. Philbin's episodes aired November 30-December 4, 2009, and debuted new rules on the show.
In October 2007, Philbin was featured in the 100th anniversary issue of the Neiman Marcus Christmas Book. He was a host of the Classical Superstars Fantasy Concert, which included piano virtuoso Lola Astanova with Russia's Kirov Orchestra led by conductor Valery Gergiev. The super concert for 500 guests was offered for sale at $1.6 million.[61]
In Morris Park, Bronx, Cruger Avenue between Sagamore Street and Bronxdale Avenue was co-named Regis Philbin Avenue.[62]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          TV-talk show host, game-show host, singer, author, and TV personality, Regis Philbin became one of the most popular talk-show hosts in America and in Canada, especially. Growing up as an only child in The Bronx, New York, Philbin went to the University of Notre Dame and got a degree in sociology. Later, he would serve in the U.S. Navy and went through behind-the-scenes in radio and TV, before going into broadcasting.After moving to California, Philin got his own show on KGTV in San Diego called That Regis Philbin Show (1964). However, with no writing team, for budget reasons, this led him to begin the show that would become his hallmark, where he engages his audience in discussions about his life and events of the day. It was, then, that he got his first big break as Joey Bishop's sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show (1961). Bishop liked to tease Philbin. But the teasing stopped when Philbin walked off the stage on a live broadcast and stayed away for several days.Philbin later hosted A.M. Los Angeles (1970), a local TV talk show on KABC-TV. With his presence, he brought the show to Number One in Los Angeles.On the show, Sarah Purcell was his first co-host, followed by Cyndy Garvey. However, when Philbin moved to New York City, they both paired up on "The Morning Show". But due to low ratings, Garvey then left once again and Philbin was then joined by Kathie Lee Gifford on the show and the ratings improved and the show's name was changed to "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee" (1988). Gifford left the show, which was called "Live with Regis" until a permanent replacement could be found.During the search, Philbin won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host, his first only Daytime award. When Kelly Ripa was chosen the same year, the show was later changed to "Live with Regis and Kelly". The pairing became successful.Besides being a successful TV host, Philbin was also a game show host on a short-lived game show called The Neighbors (1975), in which part of the game is that a contestant, usually a woman, would have to find out which one of her neighbors is gossiping about her. He then hosted Almost Anything Goes (1975). Despite both shows being failures, Philbin then hosted Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (1999), which became one of the most popular shows on TV before it was canceled in 2002 and came back with Meredith Vieira replacing Philbin. For his work on the show, he won his second Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Game Show Host.Philbin then signed a contract for "Millionaire's" spin-off: Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire (2004).

      Host of an infomercial for "The Best of the Dean Martin Variety Show". Also appearing is Greg Garrison.
      I had a blocked artery. The great thing about it was that all the people sitting at home, watching on the couch, feeling the same thing...got up and called the doctor. I still get letters thanking me for saving people's lives.
      [Of Mickey Rooney's 90th birthday in 2010]: Celebrating his 90th birthday, after all these years. When I was a little kid, I used to watch him when he was in his heyday, and it was a great show tonight, it really was, it meant a lot to a lot of people.
=======================================================
Birth Name: Regis Francis Xavier PhilbinBirth Place: New York, NYDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 08/25/1933, VirgoProfession: TV host; actor; singer
A beloved TV personality known for his emotional outbursts and uniquely inflected speech, Philbin first came to national prominence as Joey Bishop's sidekick on the comedian's eponymous late-1960s talk show. It took another decade of various on-air gigs before Philbin hit it big as the host of WABC's local Manhattan morning show in 1983. Kathie Lee Gifford joined him as co-host in 1985, and in 1988 their series, renamed Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, went into national syndication and turned them into superstars. Over the years, Philbin was tapped to host a number of other shows (Walt Disney specials, prime-time game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire) and appeared as himself in countless movies and television shows. He also weathered Gifford's 2000 departure and found great chemistry with her replacement, Kelly Ripa. In 2004, after over 15,000 hours on national television, Philbin entered the record books as the most filmed personality ever. All of those TV hours eventually took a toll on the energetic host, as he had to undergo hip-replacement surgery in 2009---though Philbin was back at work on Live just a few weeks later.Regis Philbin Fast Facts:
Famously walked off the set of The Joey Bishop Show during a 1968 broadcast in a disagreement with management, but returned three days later. 
Appeared as himself in a movie for the first of many times in Woody Allen's Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (1972). 
Achieved prime-time success in 1999 when he began hosting the hit ABC game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. 
Won his first Daytime Emmys in 2001, for Outstanding Talk Show Host (Live with Regis) and Outstanding Game Show Host (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire). 
Returned to prime time to host two seasons of the game show Million Dollar Password, a Password update that ran 2008-09 on CBS.Regis Philbin Relationships: Florence Philbin - MotherFrank Philbin - FatherFrank Philbin - BrotherDaniel Philbin - SonAmy Philbin - DaughterJoanna Philbin - DaughterKay Faylan - Ex-wifeJ.J.

Another Justin Bieber Racist Rant?! This One's Allegedly Peppered With KKK References & Is Even Worse Than The First!
Regis Philbin's wheelchair-bound son, Danny, has tried to kill himself with a pill overdose after a nasty split with his wife, Judy.
Back in December, Judy publicly appealed to her father-in-law for financial support as she and Danny struggled to make ends meet. Danny was apparently too proud to ask for help himself.
Despite throwing out a lifeline, Judy and Danny's marriage continued to drown. Judy told The Enquirer, "Danny kept telling me he could no longer be a complete husband and that I should have a sexual affair with another man. Finally, I did. But Danny went nuts and kicked me out of the house in a jealous rage. He even got a restraining order against me, falsely claiming that I had threatened him."
According to Judy, Danny then went on a rampage and "broke all the windows in the house and everything he could reach with a baseball bat" and after that "he tried to kill himself with pills. He has lots of pills, including the narcotic pain medication Darvon and also Xanax. Police told me he took a massive overdose."
A friend discovered him and rushed him to a crisis center. He was then admitted to the psychiatric ward at Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center.
The icing on the drama cake is Danny's charges that Judy was attempting to extort money from Regis. In official court documents, Danny "learned by her [Judy's] admission that she had a plan to blackmail and extort money from my father."
Perez, this is beneath you! Who fucking cares about Regis, let alone his son? Give us some real dirt that hasn't been reported by TMZ first, please!
wow, that's awful. but life is a gift; love is a bitch sometimes, and quite frankly so is life itself, but that's the whole fun of it.
Howard Stern wrote about it in his book Private parts 15 years ago, and Regis STILL doesnt give him some cash?
Regis is sending his daughters off traveling all over the world, but cant throw his disabled son some cash?
Both his kids from his first marriage are mental messes,so was his first wife. His daughter lived in a run down trailer last I heard, he's no father of the year with them.
Disgusting old creep.  Your children are always your children,  You don't divorce them when you trade in the wife for a new model.  The bastard has money to burn,,,But not for his son?
Yeah, she couldn't possibly have stayed for him. Rolls eyes. What a kick in the teeth for her for trying everything she could think of to help him.
If it WAS finally about the money, she didn't get any, now did she; and she's certainly been pushed far away either way. Dad'll have to look after him now.
This poor bastard has issues because Regis pretends he doesn't exist.  I'm boycotting Regis the cheap mother too.
There has to be more to this story. I cannot believe Regis would be this cold and unloving toward one of his children!
And what is with comment #5? How horrible a person are you that you comment like that? If you don't care about these people, say nothing and read elsewhere. Must be nice to be so perfect!
Criminal the way Regis and the midget Joy only talk about their kids together and not the children from Regis's first marriage.
JUDY is a real piece of shit.  She sold a story to National Enquirer now this crap because Danny caught her running around on him. I pray he dumps her and can get over that trash.
Regis Philbin had children with Catherine Faylen: Amy (b. 1961) and Danny c(b. 1967) and then children, with Joy Philbin, Joanna (b. 1972) and Jennifer (aka J.J. Philbin, b. 1974). Too bad he never talks about his other children… wonder how they feel about being excluded in his daily chat!  HUGS, BJ
Re: ethel –  ..how sad that you 'cannot believe Regis can be this cold and uncaring towards one of his children'…….because he is……if you listen to him, he only talks about his children with Second Wife…and again…..and I don't care….and I'm entitled to that opinion.
Regis treats his kids from his first marriage like 2nd rate.  He acts like he never had them. He always talks only about his kids with Joy….He abandoned them in many ways.
I feel bad for this guy.  His dad didn't even acknowledge him until Howard Stern outed the whole thing years ago.  But all these years later he seems to have forgotten he created Danny once again.  It's strange to think of old Regis as a sperm donor.
The only funny thing about this situation is I bet Gillman is FREAKING OUT!  wondering how the hell they are going to spin this.  They will probably have reruns of the show all week.  It is off putting how he NEVER speaks about his son and acts like he doesn't exist.
Two rules that can't be broken are 1. Money does not buy happiness. 2. You can't live someone else's life. My guess is Regis has done much over the years to help his son BUT he can't live his life. In the end the son is responsible for himself. I DO NOT BELEIVE REGIS JUST BLEW OFF HIS SON. Oh and as far as the Little Mrs leaving (join the club) they are all just a tw*t in the end?
First of all, with all that money Regis has; he should've been paying for all his disabled son's medical bills.  Secondly, what heartless bitch listens to her disabled husband when he says to go get some action somewhere else?  Many disabled people say stuff like that, but they don't mean it; damn!  And hello, what about your wedding vows, bitch?!?
Justin Bieber Apologizes For His Disgustingly Racist Song Gone Wrong: 'I Need To Step Up And Own What I Did'

Regis PhilbinTV Personality / Game Show HostBorn: 25 August 1931Birthplace: New York, New YorkBest known as: Host of the TV morning show Live With Regis And..., 1988-2011TV veteran Regis Philbin was the host of a long-running morning show that bore his name from 1988-2011.  Regis Philbin graduated from Notre Dame University in 1953, and after a stint in the U.S. Navy he got right into television. He became an upbeat jack of all trades, hosting local and national shows of all kinds, including a stint as sidekick to Joey Bishop on the comedian's late-night talk show from 1967-69. Philbin's morning show Live With Regis and Kathie Lee debuted nationally on ABC TV in September of 1988. It became his signature show, with Philbin's energy and gift of gab keeping things rolling on for years. ("In a daytime landscape filled with bland, polished hosts and smarmy good cheer, Mr. Philbin was crumpled, nasal and histrionic," said the New York Times in 2011. "He was a snaggle-tooth amid cosmetic dentistry and porcelain veneers.") His co-host Kathie Lee Gifford left the show in 2000 and was replaced by Kelly Ripa; renamed Live With Regis and Kelly, the show kept going strong until "Reeg" himself stepped down with a final show on 18 November 2011. His jolly personality made him a regular guest on other shows, and Philbin has enjoyed an ongoing played-for-laughs rivalry with late-night host David Letterman. Regis Philbin also hosted another hit, the prime-time game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, from 1999-2002. Philbin won two Emmy awards in 2001, one each as host of Live and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? He has published the memoirs I'm Only One Man (1995), Who Wants to Be Me? (2000) and How I Got This Way (2011). He was inducted into Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame in 2006.Extra credit: Regis Philbin was married to the former Catherine Faylen from 1955 until their divorce in 1968. They had two children, Amy and Daniel. Phibin then married Joy Senese in 1970, and they have two children, Joanna and Jennifer (who is known as J.J.)... Regish Philbin had triple-bypass surgery in 2007 and a hip replacement in 2009... Philbin had small roles in the movie The Bad News Bears Go to Japan (1978) and on the TV soap opera Ryan's Hope (1987-88)... Regis Philbin was succeeded as host of Millionaire by Meredith Vieira, although he returned later for stints as host in 2004 and 2009.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

Regis was Born ...: ... on August 25, 1931, as Regis Francis Xavier Philbin.  His father named him after his high school (Regis High School) and St. Francis Xavier. Long believed to be an only child, Regis announced on his Feb. 1, 2007, program that he has a brother, Frank.Growing up with Regis:New York born and bred, Regis grew up in the Bronx.  He graduated in 1953 from the University of Notre Dame (he's famous for spotlighting his alma mater) with a degree in sociology.  After college, he joined the United States Navy, launching his television career after leaving the service.Regis's First Job:p]Behind-the-scenes jobs in radio and television led Regis to his first stint as a talk show host, on the local San Diego, Calif., program The Regis Philbin Show.  His lack of a writing staff turned into his signature style; chatting to the audience about the goings on in his daily life and theirs.
His success in San Diego placed him on the national stage in 1967, when he joined The Joey Bishop Show as Joey's sidekick.The Early Years:After Joey Bishop, Regis went on to a number of talk show gigs, including A.M. Los Angeles, which he co-hosted first with Sarah Purcell and then with Cyndy Garvey.  His aplomb and easy going style quickly raised the show from the ratings basement to number one.
He eventually moved to New York and was re-teamed with Garvey (who had left previously) on WABC's The Morning Show.  It wasn't until Regis was joined by Kathie Lee (Johnson) Gifford that the show, once more, zipped up the charts.Becoming a Talk Show Host:To be honest, when has Regis not been a talk show host?  Unlike his contemporaries  David Letterman, Jay Leno, who started in comedy and landed in the talk show world, or his co-host, Kelly Ripa, who started as an actress  Regis has always occupied the hosts chair.
In fact, Regis entered the Guinness Book of World Records in 2004 when he appeared on television for the 15,188th hour, making him the record holder for Most Hours on Camera.Key Moment in His Career:Arguably his move from behind the camera to in front of the camera in the 1960s.  Add to that his ability to create a signature style, and Regis is the definition of today's talk show host.What Does the Future Hold?:Beyond his contract with Live, the broadcast world is decidedly Regis' oyster.  He's been a successful game show host (he was the original host of the American version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?) and a stellar emcee.
He's also a writer, having penned two autobiographies -- or snapshots of time, really -- and a musician and singer, taking on the crooning style of Sinatra and Martin.  He's recorded a few albums, singing pop standards, that have enjoyed moderate success.
But health and time away from family saw Regis leave Live on Nov. 18, 2011. Regis says the move isn't retirement, but merely "moving on."And Just for Fun:His father was Irish and his mother Italian-American.
Joey Bishop relentlessly teased Regis while he acted as sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show.  On one occasion, Regis grew so upset that he stormed off the live set and did not return for several days.
On New Year's 2004, Regis filled in for Dick Clark, who was recovering from a minor stroke, on Dick Clarks New Years Rockin' Eve. Regis cut short his vacation to take on the duty.
On his Christmas album, Regis sings a duet ("Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer") with Donald Trump.Regis underwent triple bypass surgery in March 2007.
