Jason Jordan Segel (born January 18, 1980) is an American actor, author, and screenwriter. He is known for his role as Marshall Eriksen in the CBS hit sitcom How I Met Your Mother, as well as his work with producer Judd Apatow on the cult classic, short-lived television series Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared; the films Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up, I Love You, Man, Gulliver's Travels, Bad Teacher, Despicable Me, The Muppets and The Five-Year Engagement.
Segel was born on January 18, 1980 in Los Angeles, California, the son of Jillian (née Jordan), a homemaker, and Alvin G. Segel, a lawyer,[1][2] and grew up in Pacific Palisades, California. His father is Jewish and his mother is Christian.[3] He has stated that he was raised Jewish,[4] as well as "a little bit of everything".[5] He went to Hebrew school and had a Bar Mitzvah, and also attended St. Matthew's Parish School, a private Episcopal school.[6][7] He has an older half-brother, Adam, and a younger sister, Alison.[8][9]
Following elementary school and middle school, Segel completed his high school studies at Harvard-Westlake School,[10] where his 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) frame[11][12] helped him as an active member of the 1996 and 1997 CIF state champion boys' basketball team. He was a backup to the team's star center, Jason Collins, who went on to play in the NBA.[10] Segel had hopes of becoming a professional actor at the same time as going to college, although he ultimately chose not to go to college. Instead, he acted in local theater productions at Palisades Playhouse.
Segel's first major role was as stoner "freak" Nick Andopolis on the critically acclaimed but short-lived 1999 NBC comedy-drama series Freaks and Geeks. The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[13] Cardellini and Segel dated for a few years following the show's cancellation.[14][15] It was rumored that she broke up with him for gaining too much weight,[16] but it was later revealed that the statement was in fact a joke taken out of context.[17]
Segel had recurring roles on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as Neil Jansen and on Undeclared as Eric. He played Marshall Eriksen on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother; he had previously stated he would move on to other projects in 2013 when his contract expired,[18] but was successfully convinced to finish the series after its ninth season in 2014.[19] Feature film appearances include Slackers, SLC Punk!, The Good Humor Man, and Dead Man on Campus. In 2007, he appeared in Knocked Up, directed by Freaks and Geeks creator Judd Apatow. Segel starred in the lead role of 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, a film he wrote and Apatow produced with Shauna Robertson for Universal Pictures. He also starred in I Love You, Man, which was released on March 20, 2009[20] by DreamWorks.
In Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Segel's character writes a "Dracula" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in a full frontal nude scene in the film.[21] In an interview,[22] he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the Jim Henson Company, and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a Muppets movie.[23] Segel performed a song from the film, entitled "Dracula's Lament", on the 1000th episode of Craig Ferguson's show, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.
For the 2010 comedy Get Him to the Greek, Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional band Infant Sorrow. He also appeared on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and sang an original song entitled "Wonky Eyed Girl".[9]
In 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, Despicable Me and appeared as "Horatio" in a fantasy comedy film Gulliver's Travels directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in Bad Teacher, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[24] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest Muppets film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but after realizing that he was an avid fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was Muppets from Space in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[25] He has stated that he will not star in the sequel to The Muppets.[26] He filmed The Five-Year Engagement, with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012.
In 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21.[27] Segel will also be in the cast of a film based on the 2012 Quebec maple syrup heist, which will be directed by Seth Gordon.[28]
Segel dated his Freaks and Geeks co-star Linda Cardellini for a few years following the show's cancellation. Segel dated actress Michelle Williams for about a year, breaking up at the end of February 2013.[29] He subsequently began dating actress Bojana Novakovic that summer.[30]
He is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.[31] He performed a wedding ceremony on The Tonight Show on July 6, 2010 for a couple that solicited his services by placing wanted pictures of him around his home town and the bar he frequently visits.[32]

          Multi-talented Jason Segel was born in Los Angeles, California, where he was raised by his parents, Jillian (Jordan), a homemaker, and Alvin Segel, a lawyer. He was educated at St. Matthew's Parish School in Pacific Palisades, before moving on to Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. During his education he showed an interest in acting and often performed in plays at the Palisades Playhouse.His major break came in 1999, when he was cast as Nick Andopolis in Judd Apatow's well-regarded series Freaks and Geeks (1999). Further TV and film roles followed, notably in How I Met Your Mother (2005) and Knocked Up (2007). His film breakthrough, however, came in 2008's hit Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) which he wrote and starred in. Segel also went on to co-write and star in The Muppets (2011).Segel is also a musician and songwriter, with his songs appearing in many projects including Freaks and Geeks (1999), Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), I Love You, Man (2009), How I Met Your Mother (2005) and Get Him to the Greek (2010).
      Was chosen for the role of Marshall Eriksen in How I Met Your Mother (2005) because of his work on the short lived television show Freaks and Geeks (1999) of which creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas were huge fans.
      Is an Ordained Minister with the Universal Life Church and married couple Jason Wood and Abbe Wood on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno: Episode #18.79 (2010) on July 6th, 2010. This was only the second marriage to be performed on the Tonight Show. The first marriage was Tiny Tim and his wife, Vicki Budinger, in 1969, on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson: Episode dated 17 December 1969 (1969).
      His father's family is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Russia, Poland, and Austria). His mother has English, Scottish, Irish, and fairly distant French, ancestry.
      When a woman does nudity in a movie, men immediately switch into a sexual mode. For women, from what I understand, it's not like that. They see a naked, out-of-shape man crying and it's funny -- something weird, disturbing and disgusting we can all laugh at.
      {On his full-frontal performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)] I drank a lot to get me through that. I remember just pacing up and down, drunk, with these voices in my head saying, "Jason, what are you doing?" I'm a little nervous, I won't get a date anymore, they won't be satisfied with what they saw.
      [on the Muppets] They'e not puppets. We never use the word puppet because Kermit is a frog, Piggy is a pig. They exist in the world, like we do.
      One thing that I think never goes out of style is just purity. Niceness and purity. And the Muppets have never lost that. Kermit especially is just wide-eyed wonder, unblinking. And he can't blink. Which I think probably helps.
      [on his religion] ...my father is Jewish and my mother is Christian, but I was raised Jewish... I was the only Jewish kid at this all-Christian school and that was a little weird... So, I am at this school and they really don't like me very much there. And then after Christian school I would in the afternoons walk to Hebrew school and then at Hebrew school they would tell me I was not really Jewish because my mother is Christian. So, all of a sudden I'm like this young kid--I would have been happy to believe whatever--whoever would have been nice to me. You know? But it was this feeling of not really belonging or not really fitting in... what occurred to me was that this certainly isn't God. God doesn't want an 11 and 12-year-old kid to feel this way. You know. My belief in God is that God wants you. God wants you to believe in him, or it, whatever you would call it.

Los Angeles native Jason Segel is a lucky guy. The former basketball star got his big acting break when he put on a play The Zoo Story by Edward Albee in high school all on his own, and the head of the acting department suggested he give up basketball and give acting a try. Segel first laughed at the suggestion, but finally agreed to audition for the teacher and another woman. The woman happened to be the casting president at Paramount, and it was this audition that helped him land the role in the film Dead Man On Campus that jump-started his career. 
He has come a long way since, appearing in films Can't Hardly Wait(1998), SLC Punk!(1998), and New Jersey Turnpikes (1999), before landing the role of Nick, a "freak" on Judd Apatow-produced cult television series Freaks and Geeks. A talented piano player, Segel wrote a song for his character to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini), in an episode of the show, and Segel and Cardellini dated for a few years after the show ended. He then played parts in films such as Slackers (2002), 11:14 (2003), Certainly Not A Fairytale (2003), The Good Humor Man (2005), and Bye Bye Benjamin (2006), and guest starred in television series Undeclared (2001 to 2002), Alias (2005), and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2004 to 2005). 
His more well-known roles are in the popular Hollywood films Knocked Up (2007) and Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), and the television comedy series How I Met Your Mother which debuted in 2005. Segel employed many of his creative talents in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, as in addition to starring in the film, he wrote the entire screenplay and the music for the puppet musical. He had been writing the musical, Dracula's Lament, separately from the film, but decided eventually to incorporate the two together. Segel also made a big splash by including his own full-frontal nudity in the movie, aiming for pure comedic value. "If you can find the line between sympathetic and creepy, you have reached a very funny area," he explained. He is no stranger to this type of comedy, often choosing to take in the view out of his Los Angeles home in the nude.
In addition to continuing his role as Marshall Eriksen on How I Met Your Mother, Segel can be seen in the comedy I Love You, Man (2009) alongside Paul Rudd, Gulliver's Travels (2010), Despicable Me (2010), Bad Teacher (2011) and Friends with Benefits (2011). In 2011, he got to bring his love for the Muppets to the big screen when he co-wrote, co-produced and starred in the feature film The Muppets. Segel also has two big films, both comedies, lined up for 2012: Jeff, Who Lives at Home about a man who discovers his destiny while out running an errand for his mother, and The Five-Year Engagement about a couple who have an extra long engagement because they can't nail down a date for their wedding.
He loves Disneyland and is a fan of classic rock and reggae music. In February 2012 he was honored with the title of Man of the Year by Harvard Universityâs Hasty Pudding Theatricals, Americaâs oldest undergraduate drama troupe.

Born January 18th, 1980, the first decade or so of Jason Segel's career as a Hollywood actor, he spent his time earning cult-favorite status -- beginning with the jet-black comedy Dead Man on Campus (1998), then the NBC comedy drama Freaks and Geeks (1999). Segel subsuquently achieved broader recognition for his long-running performance as Marshall on the beloved sitcom How I Met Your Mother. He also played Jason in the big-screen feature Knocked Up (2007), Judd Apatow's uproarious follow-up to The 40-Year-Old Virgin. 
Fresh off his success in Knocked Up, Segel parlayed his newfound wide-scale popularity into the ultimate chance to showcase his skills, writing and starring in the side splitting romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), alongside Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, and Russell Brand.
The massively succesful film also featured a supporting performance by funnyman Paul Rudd, who reteamed with Segal for 2009's buddy comedy I Love You, Man. Having found a niche with audiences, the actor next picked up another tonally similar comedy, appearing with Cameron Diaz in the sharp witted, hard-R rated Bad Teacher in 2011. Later that same year, Segal showcased his talents on both sides of the camera yet again, writing the script for a reboot of Jim Henson's beloved Muppets, and starring in the film alongside the furry stars as well. As Segal geared up for 2012, he signed on to star alongside Emily Blunt in the romantic comedy A Five Year Engagement. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi

After Freaks and Geeks, Segel bounced around in different roles until his next big break in 2005, when he landed the role of Marshall on the CBS show How I Met Your Mother.
With the success of his new TV series, Segel teamed up again with Apatow in the movie Knocked Up. Then, in 2008, Segel landed the lead role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which he wrote after being inspired by a real-life relationship.
