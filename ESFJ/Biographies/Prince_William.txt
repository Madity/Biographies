Prince William, Duke of Cambridge KG KT ADC(P) (William Arthur Philip Louis;[fn 1] born 21 June 1982), is the elder son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. His paternal grandparents are Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is second in line to succeed his grandmother, after his father.
Prince William was educated at four schools in the United Kingdom and obtained a degree from the University of St Andrews. He spent parts of a gap year in Chile, Belize, Tanzania, and Kenya, where he has lived and holidayed several times. Prince William has also taken Kiswahili studies at universities in Kenya and Tanzania. He also completed training as an officer (eventually being commissioned as a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals Regiment), and a pilot (earning his wings by completing pilot training at Royal Air Force College Cranwell) in the British military. He then underwent helicopter flying training in order to become a full-time pilot with the Search and Rescue Force.
Prince William married Catherine Middleton, on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey. Hours prior to the event, Buckingham Palace announced that he would be created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus. Their first child, Prince George of Cambridge, was born on 22 July 2013.
Following the end of his more than seven-and-a-half years of full-time service with the British armed forces, in early 2014, from early January to late March, Prince William will attend a series of seminars, lectures, and meetings in agricultural management at the University of Cambridge.[2]
Prince William, the first child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, was born at St Mary's Hospital, London, on 21 June 1982.[3] A week later on 28 June his name was announced by Buckingham Palace: William Arthur Philip Louis.[3] He was baptised in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace on 4 August 1982 (the 82nd birthday of his paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.[4] William had six godparents; former King Constantine II of Greece (his paternal cousin); Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy (his paternal cousin); the Duchess of Westminster; Lady Susan Hussey; Lord Romsey (his paternal cousin); and Sir Laurens van der Post.[3][5] He was the first child born to a Prince and Princess of Wales since Prince John in 1905.[6] The Prince was affectionately called "Wombat" by his parents[7] or "Wills" (the latter a name coined by the press).[8]
At age seven, William reportedly told his mother that he desired to be a police officer when he was older so that he might be able to protect her; a statement to which his brother responded: "Oh, no you can't. You've got to be King."[9] William's first public appearance was on 1 March 1991 (Saint David's Day), during an official visit of his parents to Cardiff, Wales. After arriving by aeroplane, William was taken to Llandaff Cathedral where he signed the visitors' book, thereby demonstrating that he was left-handed. On 3 June 1991, William was admitted to Royal Berkshire Hospital after being accidentally hit on the side of the forehead by a fellow student wielding a golf club. He did not lose consciousness, but suffered a depressed fracture of the skull and was operated on at the Great Ormond Street Hospital, resulting in a permanent scar.[10] In a 2009 interview, he dubbed this scar a "Harry Potter scar". He was reported to have said, "I call it (the scar) that because it glows sometimes and some people notice it—other times they don't notice it at all".[11]
His mother wanted him and his younger brother Harry to have wider experiences than are usual for royal children. She took them to Walt Disney World and McDonald's as well as AIDS clinics and shelters for the homeless. She bought them typical teenage items, such as video games.[12] Diana, who was by then divorced from the Prince of Wales, died in a car accident in 1997. William, along with his brother and father, was staying at Balmoral Castle at the time. The Prince of Wales waited until early the following morning to tell his sons about their mother's death.[13] At his mother's funeral, William accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather and maternal uncle in walking behind the funeral cortège from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey.
William was educated at independent schools, starting at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London.[14] Following this, he attended Ludgrove School near Wokingham, Berkshire, and was privately tutored during summers by Rory Stewart.[15] At Ludgrove he also participated in football—along with swimming, basketball, clay pigeon shooting, and cross country running. William sat for the entrance exam to Eton College and was admitted. There, he studied geography, biology and history of art at A-Level, obtaining an A in geography, a C in biology and a B in history of art.[16][17][18] At Eton, he continued to play football, captaining his house team, and took up water polo.[19] The decision to place William in Eton went against the family tradition of sending royal children to Gordonstoun (William's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins all attended); however, both Diana's father and brother had attended Eton.[12] The Royal Family and the tabloid press agreed that William would be allowed to study free of paparazzi intrusion in exchange for regular updates of the Prince's life. The chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, John Wakeham, said of the arrangement: "Prince William is not an institution; nor a soap star; nor a football hero. He is a boy: in the next few years, perhaps the most important and sometimes painful part of his life, he will grow up and become a man."[12]
After completing his studies at Eton, the Prince took a gap year, during which he took part in British Army training exercises in Belize,[20] worked in English dairy farms, visited Africa,[21] and for ten weeks taught children in southern Chile. As part of the Raleigh International programme in the town of Tortel, the Prince lived with other young teachers, sharing in the common household chores, including cleaning the toilet, and also volunteered as the guest radio jockey for the local radio station.[20]
By 2001, William was back in the United Kingdom and had enrolled, under the name William Wales,[22][23] at the University of St Andrews. News of this caused a temporary increase in the number of applications to St Andrews, mostly from young women who wanted an opportunity to meet him.[24] The extra attention did not deter him, though, and he embarked on a degree course in art history, later changing his main subject to geography, and going on to earn a Scottish Master of Arts degree with upper second class honours. While at university, he represented the Scottish national universities water polo team at the Celtic Nations tournament in 2004.[19] He was known as "Steve" by other students to avoid any journalists overhearing and realising his identity.[8]
The Prince returned to St Andrews in February 2011 as Patron of the university's 600th Anniversary Appeal.[25]
William began to accompany his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas royal tour was with his parents to Australia and New Zealand in 1983,[26] a decision made by the Princess of Wales that was considered to be unconventional; not only was William so young, but both the first and second in line for the throne would be travelling together.[12] However, he accompanied either both parents or his father on subsequent tours, and, upon graduation from university, began to undertake duties of his own, as well as obtaining experience in the private workforce when he worked with land management at Chatsworth House and interned at HSBC.[12]
Having decided to follow a military career, in October 2005 William attended the four-day Regular Commissions Board at Westbury in Wiltshire where he underwent selection to judge his suitability to become an army officer. Having passed selection, William went up to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 2006.[27] Successfully completing the course, William graduated from Sandhurst on 15 December 2006, the graduation parade being attended by the Queen and the Prince of Wales, along with other members of the Royal Family. William officially received his commission as a lieutenant at midnight. With his rank obtained, as "Lieutenant Wales" (a name based on his father's title, Prince of Wales), he followed his younger brother[28] into the Blues and Royals as a troop commander in an armoured reconnaissance unit, after which he spent four months in training for the post at Bovington Camp, Dorset.
Once officially enrolled and commissioned in the armed forces, William wanted active service; in this there were recent precedents: his great-great-uncle Edward VIII, when Prince of Wales, served in France during the First World War; his great-grandfather King George VI served during World War I with the Navy at the Battle of Jutland and in France with the Air Force; and his paternal grandfather Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, served with distinction during World War II. More recently, his uncle Prince Andrew, Duke of York, served in the Falklands War.
Though Major-General Sir Sebastian Roberts, General Officer commanding the Household Division, had said William's deployment was possible, the Prince's position as second in line to the throne, and the convention of ministers advising against the person in that position being put into dangerous situations, cast doubts on William's ability to see combat. These doubts increased after Prince Harry's deployment was cancelled in 2007, due to "specific threats". William, instead, went on to training in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, obtaining his commission as a sub-lieutenant in the former and flying officer in the latter (both broadly equivalent to the rank of lieutenant in the army). With this complete, William undertook an attachment with the Royal Air Force, undergoing an intensive four-month training course at RAF Cranwell.[29][30] Upon completing the course on 11 April 2008, he was presented with his RAF wings by his father,[31] who had himself received his wings after training at the same college.[32] During this secondment Prince William flew to Afghanistan in a C-17 Globemaster, which repatriated the body of Trooper Robert Pearson, in what Max Clifford described as a "PR exercise".[33] William had been affectionately known by his fellow airmen as "Billy the Fish", a pun on the name "William Wales".[34]
William was then seconded to train with the navy for two months, from June to August 2008, during which time he spent three weeks at the Britannia Royal Naval College, training on units of the surface fleet and submarines, as well as with the Fleet Air Arm and Royal Marines.[35] He spent a day on submarine HMS Talent.[36] During a five week deployment on HMS Iron Duke in the Caribbean, he took part in a joint operation with the US Coast Guard that identified and captured a speedboat carrying 900 kg of cocaine worth approximately £40 million.[37][38] The ship also took part in other raids.[39]
Owing to William's future role, a long-term career in the military was considered out of the question; due to his position his desire to see active service was always unlikely to be granted. William originally joined the military on a short-service commission lasting three years. However, it was announced in September 2008 that he would be extending his time in the forces, first by taking on another secondment in 2008 (including working at the MOD and non-operational flying with the Army Air Corps).[40] Then it was announced that he would transfer from the Army to the RAF in order to train as a full-time search and rescue helicopter pilot, a role that enables him to take an active role in the armed forces without being deployed on combat operations.
In January 2009, William transferred his commission to the RAF and was promoted to Flight Lieutenant. He trained to become a helicopter pilot with the RAF's Search and Rescue Force. In January 2010, he graduated from the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury, where he had been under the instruction of Squadron Leader Craig Finch.[41] On 26 January 2010, he transferred to the Search and Rescue Training Unit at RAF Valley on Anglesey to receive training on the Sea King search and rescue helicopter and graduated from this course on 17 September 2010.[42] This made him the first member of the British Royal Family since Henry VII to live in Wales.[43]
It was announced on 15 April 2010 that William will remain at RAF Valley for his operational tour, being assigned to C Flight No. 22 Squadron[44] and initially performing co-pilot duties.[45] His operational tour was expected to last 30 to 36 months.[46]
His first rescue mission (as co-pilot of an RAF Sea King Helicopter) was a response to an emergency call from the Liverpool Coastguard on 2 October 2010. The Prince, who was excited to finally take part in an active mission, and the other three members of the crew, flew from their base at RAF Valley to an offshore gas rig in Morecambe Bay, northwest England. A man who had suffered an apparent heart attack on the rig was airlifted to a local hospital.[47] In November 2011, he participated in a search and rescue mission involving a sinking cargo ship in the Irish Sea. As co-pilot, he helped rescue two sailors, who were then transported to a hospital in Bangor.[48]
William deployed to the Falkland Islands for a six-week tour with No. 1564 Flight, beginning in February and ending in March 2012.[49][50] The deployment of the Duke to the Falklands close to the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the conflict (2 April 1982) was condemned by Argentina as a "provocative act".[51][52]
In June 2012 Prince William gained a qualification to be captain or pilot in charge of a Sea King rather than a co-pilot.[53] His active service as an RAF search and rescue pilot ended in September 2013.[54]
At the age of 21, Prince William was appointed as a Counsellor of State, and began his royal duties by first serving in that capacity when the Queen was in Nigeria to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2003. For his 21st birthday, William accompanied his father on a royal tour of Wales, visiting the Anglesey Food Fair and opening a centre for the homeless in Newport.[55] By July 2005, he was on his first solo overseas tour, travelling to New Zealand, to participate in World War II commemorations on behalf of his grandmother in her role as Queen of New Zealand. For the 30th anniversary of his father's charity, The Prince's Trust, William and his brother were interviewed together for the first time by Ant & Dec.[55] In July 2007, Prince William accompanied his grandmother's cousin the Duke of Kent, who is President of the UK Scout Association, in opening the 21st World Scout Jamboree, celebrating the centennial of the founding of the Scout Movement.
Tina Brown said in her 2007 biography of Diana, Princess of Wales, that Prince William had, like his father, expressed a desire to become Governor-General of Australia,[56] though the idea was considered doubtful by Prime Minister of Australia John Howard, who said: "We have for a long time embraced the idea that the person who occupies that post should be in every way an Australian citizen."[57]
In 2009, a private office was set up for William by his grandmother, with Sir David Manning as his adviser.[58]
Manning personally accompanied him in January 2010 as he toured Auckland and Wellington on behalf of the Queen; William opened the new building of the Supreme Court of New Zealand and was welcomed by a Māori chief.[59] William succeeded Lord Attenborough in 2010 as the fifth President of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[60]
In March 2011, William visited Christchurch, New Zealand, after the recent earthquake,[61] and addressed the memorial service at Hagley Park, on behalf of his grandmother[62] Upon leaving New Zealand, William travelled to Australia, to visit areas badly affected by flooding in the states of Queensland and Victoria.[63][64] After twice accompanying his parents to Canada, the Prince, with his wife, toured the country and visited the United States in June and July 2011, attending Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill.[65][66] On 2 November, the Duke and Duchess visited the UNICEF Supply Division Centre for supplying food to malnourished African children in Copenhagen, Denmark.[67][68] In September 2012, they toured Singapore, Malaysia, Tuvalu and the Solomon Islands as part of the Queen's Jubilee celebrations.
Following his parents' examples, William took interest in various causes from a relatively early age. The late Princess of Wales' work with HIV/AIDS aid and prevention, and the Prince of Wales' work with the natural environment and the inner-city disadvantaged, directed William into those areas. He also showed a desire to focus on the needy in Africa, sometimes working with his brother's charity, Sentebale.
William became aware of HIV/AIDS in the mid-1990s, when his mother began to take her two sons to visit shelters and clinics for those suffering from the disease. In January 2005, William and his brother volunteered at a British Red Cross aid distribution centre to pack emergency supplies for countries that were affected by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.[69] Later, in September, William granted his patronage to Centrepoint, a charity that assists the homeless.[70][71] During the period when his mother had been patron of Centrepoint, he had accompanied her on visits to its headquarters and projects.
William also worked in the children's unit at The Royal Marsden Hospital for two days of work experience in 2005, as well as helping out in the medical research, catering, and fund raising departments.[70] The same year, he spent two weeks in North Wales with a mountain rescue team.[69] In May 2007, William became patron of both organisations (his mother had also previously been patron of the Royal Marsden Hospital) and he became attracted to Mountain Rescue England and Wales in order to, in his words, "highlight and celebrate the vital, selfless and courageous work of our mountain rescue organisations".[70]
The Prince also became a patron of the Tusk Trust in December 2005,[70] a charity that works towards conserving wildlife and initiating community development, including providing education, across Africa.[72] He became associated with the organisation after he witnessed its work first hand in Africa. Saying "rural African initiatives that foster education, responsibility and participation in the local community light the way to conservation",[73] he carried out his first official duty with the trust in launching a 5,000-mile (8,000 km) bike ride across the African continent in 2007. In 2010, he became a patron of 100 Women in Hedge Funds Philanthropic Initiatives.[74]
In March 2011, the Duke and Duchess set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers who wanted to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities instead.[75] The gift fund supported 26 charities of the couple’s choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation. These causes are close to their hearts and reflect the experiences, passions and values of their lives so far.[76][77][78][79][80]
William plays polo for charitable causes. He is a fan of football and supports Aston Villa.[81] He became President of England's Football Association in May 2006 and vice royal patron of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in February 2007 (supporting the Queen as patron of the WRU).[70] The same year, the WRU's decision to name a new cup for test matches between Wales and South Africa the Prince William Cup caused controversy, with some believing it would have been more fitting to name the trophy after Ray Gravell.[82][83][84]
In 2006, the Prince, along with other Sandhurst officers, took part in running one mile to support the charity Sport Relief, as he had done in 2004 with a team from Clarence House. In May 2007, William became patron of the English Schools' Swimming Association.[70]
The Prince and his brother are both enthusiastic motorcyclists, with the Prince owning a Ducati 1198 S Corse.
During Prince William's years at university, he participated in university life and said: "I'm not a party animal, despite what some people might think."[12] As with his father before him, William's private life became the subject of tabloid speculation, especially around his relationship with Catherine Middleton, who had been one of William's university flatmates and whom William began dating in 2003. Middleton attended William's passing-out parade at Sandhurst, which was the first high-profile event that she attended as his guest. The relationship between them was followed so closely that bookmakers took bets on the possibility of a royal wedding and the retail chain Woolworths produced memorabilia bearing the likenesses of the couple.[85] Media attention became so intense that William asked paparazzi to keep their distance from Middleton.[85]
It was reported in April 2007 that the couple had split,[85] though Middleton, in June, attended a party at Lulworth Army Barracks as the guest of Prince William and in July the Concert for Diana, which had been organised by Princes William and Harry. In subsequent months, she accompanied William on holiday and joined the Royal Family on private outings and at public events.
On 16 November 2010, Clarence House announced that William and Catherine were to marry; the couple became engaged in Kenya in October. The engagement ring given by William to Catherine was that which had belonged to his mother.

The wedding took place on 29 April 2011 in Westminster Abbey, London.[86] Catherine and William chose to break with royal protocol and, like Diana, Princess of Wales, omit any vow by Catherine that she "obey" her husband.[citation needed] A few hours prior to the ceremony, William's new titles of Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus were announced,[87][88][89] as is customary for princes on the occasion of their weddings.[90] The titles became official on 26 May 2011, when Letters Patent to that effect were signed and recorded on the Roll of the Peerage.[91]
The Duchess of Cambridge's first pregnancy was announced on 3 December 2012.[92] She was admitted on 22 July 2013 to the Lindo Wing, St Mary's Hospital, London, where Prince William himself had been delivered. Later that day, she gave birth to a baby boy—Prince George of Cambridge—with Prince William present.[93][94]
William is godfather to Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece and Denmark (grandson of William's godfather, the former King Constantine II of Greece),[95] Tom Pettifer (son of William's former nanny, Tiggy Pettifer) and Grace van Cutsem (daughter of William's friend since childhood, Hugh van Cutsem).[96]
The Duke's style and title in full is His Royal Highness Prince William Arthur Philip Louis, Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, Baron Carrickfergus, Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter,[100] Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle,[97] Personal Aide-de-Camp to Her Majesty The Queen[101]
As a British prince, William does not use a surname for everyday purposes. For formal and ceremonial purposes, the children of the Prince of Wales use the title of "prince" or "princess" before their Christian name and their father's territorial designation after it. Thus, Prince William was styled as "Prince William of Wales". Such area-based surnames are discarded by women when they marry and by men if they are given a peerage of their own,[102] such as when Prince William was given his dukedom.
For the male-line grandchildren of Elizabeth II, however, there is currently some uncertainty over the correct form of family surname to use, or whether there even is a surname. The Queen has stipulated all her male-line descendants who do not bear the titular dignity of prince shall use Mountbatten-Windsor as their family surname (although Letters Patent exist stipulating the name Windsor, but with the same caveat). According to their flight suits as seen in television interviews, Princes William and Harry both used Wales as their surname for military purposes; this continues to be the case for William since his creation as Duke of Cambridge.[103]
On the morning of his wedding, it was announced the Queen would confer the titles Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus upon William.[87] The letters patent received the great seal on 26 May 2011.[104]

Accompanied by his father, Prince William proceeds to St George's Chapel to be installed as a Knight of the Garter.
 Since 25 May 2012: Extra Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle (KT)[112][113][114]
Prince William is the 1,000th member of the register of the Order of the Garter,[115] and was officially invested by the Queen on 16 June 2008 at a service at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[116] The last time a monarch appointed a grandchild into the Order of the Garter was in 1894, when Queen Victoria invested Prince Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

Prince William was granted a personal coat of arms on his 18th birthday. It is based on the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, with a white (or silver) label with three points, the centre point bearing a red clam shell (an "escallop"), to distinguish it from the arms of other members of the Royal Family. The escallop is drawn from the Spencer coat of arms, a reference to his mother, who was the daughter of the Earl Spencer.[125]
Quarterly: 1st and 4th, Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale Or (England); 2nd, Or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory counterflory Gules (Scotland); 3rd, Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent (Ireland).
The whole distinguished by a label of three points Argent, the central point charged with an escallop Gules.
 The Duke of Cambridge's personal Royal Standard is that of the sovereign in right of the United Kingdom, labelled for difference as in his arms.  The Earl of Strathearn's personal standard in Scotland follows the pattern of the Royal Standard used in Scotland, labelled for difference.
As the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, Prince William's coat of arms has a label of three points.[126] The escallop (seashell) alludes to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, whose Spencer coat of arms includes three escallops Argent.
In September 2013, the Queen granted a conjugal coat of arms to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, consisting of their individual arms displayed side by side, beneath a helm and coronet denoting the Duke's status as grandson of the Sovereign.[127]
The Duke of Cambridge also holds a personal royal standard for Canada, consisting of the shield of the Canadian Royal Arms defaced with both a blue roundel surrounded by a wreath of gold maple leaves and shells, within which is a depiction William's cypher (a W surmounted by a coronet), and a white label of three points, charged with a red shell.[128]
Prince William is a descendant by alternating male and female lines of William the Conqueror, first king of Norman England. He is therefore also a descendant of Charlemagne.
By direct paternal ancestry, via his grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh, he is a descendant of Elimar I, Count of Oldenburg, and as such a member of the House of Oldenburg, one of Europe's oldest royal houses, and more specifically the cadet branch known as the House of Glücksburg, founded by William's paternal ancestor Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. William's ancestors on the male line include five kings: Christian I of Denmark, Frederick I of Denmark, Christian III of Denmark, Christian IX of Denmark and George I of Greece, and also eleven counts of Oldenburg, two dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, five dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, and one duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.[129]
Via his mother, William descends from the Spencer family, the Earl Spencer, and the Baron Fermoy family, and more anciently from Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, two of the illegitimate sons of King Charles II. As king, William would be the first monarch since Anne to descend from Charles I, and the first to descend from Charles II.[130][131]
William descends matrilineally from Eliza Kewark, a housekeeper for his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Theodore Forbes, a Scottish merchant who worked for the East India Company in Surat. She is variously described in contemporary documents as "a dark-skinned native woman", "an Armenian woman from Bombay", and "Mrs. Forbesian".[131] Genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner assumed she was Armenian.[132] In June 2013, BritainsDNA announced that genealogical DNA tests on two of William's distant matrilineal cousins confirm that Eliza Kewark was matrilineally of Indian descent.[130][133][134][135]
The generations indicate descent from George I, who formalised the use of the titles prince and princess for members of the British Royal Family.

=======================================================
Prince William of Wales, whose full name is William Arthur Philip Louis Mountbatten-Windsor, is the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and second in the line of succession to the British throne.
He is the elder son of Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, born on 21 June 1982. His brother, third in line to the throne, is Prince Harry.William was the first royal prince to attend an ordinary primary school, rather than being educated at home. In other respects William's childhood was anything but typical. Wherever Prince William went, bodyguards (and photographers) were not far behind.At the age of eight, William was sent to Ludgrove, a boarding school, where he shared a room with four other boys during his five years there. It was around this time that his parents separated, forcing William and Harry to divide their time between Charles and Diana when they were not in school.The Prince and Princess of Wales were both reportedly warm parents, but William was especially close to his mother. Diana broke royal protocol, by hugging the boys in public and taking them to amusement parks and McDonald's fast food restaurants.William received his secondary education at the exclusive Eton College, where he was generally treated as a normal pupil.His world was shattered on 31st August, 1997 when Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. Despite his intense grief, William helped to make the arrangements for his mother's unusual funeral. It was his idea for Elton John to sing 'Candle in the Wind'. Prince William walked in the funeral procession with his father, brother and grandfather.In 2000, Prince William graduated from Eton after passing three A-level exams and spent a year travelling and pursuing educational projects, before embarking on a History of Art degree at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where he met his future wife. 
After changing his main subject to Geography, William graduated in 2005 with a Master of Arts degree with upper-second class honours, the highest academic achievement of any heir to the British throne.The following year, William joined his brother at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst to train as an Army Officer. He passed out in December 2006, following his brother into the Blues and Royals regiment as a troop leader.It was reported in October 2007 that William’s former Platoon Commander, Major Alexis Roberts, had been killed while on active duty in Afghanistan. The Prince was said to be deeply saddened by the news.2006 was an important year for the young royal, as the Queen appointed William to two patronages of the Royal Navy. He became Commodore-in-Chief for Scotland and Commodore-in-Chief for submarines. He also started to carry out more public engagements in parallel with his military career.William’s personal life has been the subject of intense media scrutiny. In 2005, the media began following his long-term relationship with then girlfriend Kate Middleton, formerly one of his university flatmates, whom he began dating in 2003.Interest in the couple reached new heights in January 2007, amid mounting speculation they were about to get engaged, when a paparazzi scrum formed outside Miss Middleton's home on her 25th birthday.Days later the Press Complaints Commission circulated a letter from her solicitors, saying Miss Middleton was being harassed and a formal complaint would be made if paparazzi pictures continued to be used. 
Prince William was appointed as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter on 23 April 2008, St George’s Day. He earned his wings by completing pilot training at Royal Air Force College Cranwell. He went on to become a lieutenant in the Household Cavalry and started training to become a search and rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force.
In January 2010, William graduated from the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury and by autumn of the same year, he had finished his generic and special-to-type helicopter training. This allowed the future king to be posted on Anglesey at RAF Valley on No. 22 Squadron where he performs co-pilot duties on the Sea King search and rescue helicopter.
Like his father, Prince Charles, and late mother, Prince William is president or patron to a variety of charities, including Centrepoint, which helps young, homeless people, conservation charity, Tusk Trust and the Child Bereavement Charity. In September 2009 The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry was set up to help them both forward their charitable ambitions. These will focus on three particular areas of interest for the Princes: young people, the environment and the armed forces.Recently William has written articles for the press concerning the armed forces, including a piece for the Daily Express in November 2010 in support of a planned memorial in honour of the members of Bomber Command who fought during the Second World War.
In November 2010 it was announced the Prince William was engaged to his long-term girlfriend, Kate Middleton. The couple met during their time at St Andrews University in Fife, Scotland, and have been together since. Their wedding was scheduled for 29 April 2011, which would have been the thirtieth anniversary of the marriage of his parents.Not letting the upcoming wedding get in the way of his public engagements, Prince William supported England 2018, which was the Football Association's unsuccessful bid for the right to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup in the UK. In his capacity as the FA's president, the prince worked with prime minister David Cameron and England international David Beckham on the project. They all spoke as part of the slick presentation at Fifa's headquarters in Zurich, but their effort failed to attract any support from the football body's members.
In March 2011, with less than a month to his wedding, it was revealed that Prince William's brother and best man Prince Harry had hosted a secret stag do for the soon to be married heir to the throne.On 29 April 2011, all eyes were on Prince William when he married Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey. Just a few hours prior to his nuptials, William was made the Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathern and Baron Carrickfergus.
The Royal wedding was made a public holiday and around 300 million people watched William get married and enjoy his first kiss with Kate on the balcony outside Buckingham Palace.
Prince William and Kate danced their first dance as a married couple to 'Your Song' performed by Ellie Goulding. Their reception lasted until 3am.
Since then, the couple reportedly spent two weeks honeymooning in the Seychelles after William had been at work as an RAF pilot.
After their honeymoon, William was sent to the Falklands for ten weeks for RAF training and due to the remote location, his new wife couldn't join him.
The couple have moved into an apartment at Kensington Palace which is where they will stay when they are in London. They claim their home is their rented cottage in Anglesey.
Last month, William followed in the footsteps of his mother Diana by visiting the Royal Marsden hospital, of which she was a patron.
The Duke and Duchess met the children, who are being treated for various forms of cancer, at the hospital's new children's wing.
On 19 October 2011, Prince William was named the most influential man in the world by an askmen.com survey.
On 22 July 2013, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge became the proud parents of a baby boy. Their son, the Prince of Cambridge, is third in line to the throne.

On June 21, 1982, the royals welcome their first son, His Royal Highness Prince William Arthur Philip Louis Windsor of Wales. The newborn is the second in line for the British throne following his father. Prince Charles tells PEOPLE of his son, "He has the good fortune not to look like me." Two years later, they welcome Prince Harry.1983Mother's Common TouchPrincess Diana displays a hands-on parenting approach uncommon among the royals and takes nine-month-old William along when she and Prince Charles make an official visit to Australia. 1990Mama's BoyAs a young boy, William becomes his mother's closest confidant, "soul mate" and "chief comforter," according to Vanity Fair's Christopher Anderson in 2003.

The boys split the remainder of their Christmas holiday between their feuding parents. Charles tells the BBC in 1994 that he never loved his princess bride, and Diana tells journalist Martin Bashir, "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," referring to Charles' longtime love Camilla Parker Bowles. Throughout the marriage, Diana battled bulimia and depression, which she blames on Charles and the Royal Family's coldness. 1995September 06A Royal's EducationDiana tries to give her sons as normal an upbringing as possible. She rejects Charles' alma mater, a boarding school in Scotland, for Eton College, a prestigious public boarding school near London, where Diana's father and brother both attended. The Royal Family and the British press strike a deal: the royals will provide information on William once every term in exchange for his privacy. "Prince William is not an institution; nor a soap star; nor a football hero," Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, says to the press.

A crowd of 1,100 shows up at the auction, raising a total of $5.76 million for AIDS and breast cancer charities.

Following her death, Prince Charles flies to Paris to bring her body to London for burial, and drapes the royal standard over her coffin, acknowledging in death her status as a member of the Royal Family. During this time Queen Elizabeth's silence is interpreted by the British press as indifferent and aloof. After a week of seclusion, the Queen returns with her grandsons from Balmoral Castle in Scotland to address the public.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Prince William Arthur Philip Louis was born on June 21, 1982 to Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Prince and Princess of Wales. At his birth he became and is still second in line to the throne of the United Kingdom, after his father. His early life was spent living in London in Kensington Palace. When he was four and a half he started nursery school at the Mrs. Maynard Acadamy. Aged eight, he went to Wetherby School, then to a boarding school called Ludgrove which is about 25 miles from London. When he was 10 his parents separated and they divorced when he was 14. Aged 13, he started at Eton College, an all boys school near Windsor, in Berkshire, and close to Windsor Castle, the home of his grandmother. On August 31, 1997 William was woken up with the news that his mother had died in a car crash in Paris. Since her death he has been very protective of his younger brother, Harry, now a cadet at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Prince William is due to join him in 2006, having graduated from the University of St Andrews with an Upper Second Class Degree in History of Art. If his father accedes to the throne, he is likely to become His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales. If William becomes King, it is not known what title he might take, but it is likely to be William V.
      He cannot fly in the same plane as his father because an accident might take the lives of two future kings.
      Is fluent in French and Latin. Also speaks some Spanish, and is learning Welsh for when he inherits the title of Prince of Wales.
      Finished at Eton College in June 2000. While there, he lived in Manor House and he was co-captain of his swim team.
      Graduated from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland with an upper second class degree in history of art (2005)
      Before going to university he took a gap year and for part of that he worked on a project with the charity group Raleigh where young people help poorer communities in the world.
      William is a dedicated polo player along with his brother, Prince Harry Windsor, and father, 'Prince Charles'.
      Born at St. Mary's Hospital in London. He is the first British prince to be born in a hospital.
      Christened on August 4, 1982 in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Robert Runcie.
      While at Eton, he was the Secretary of the Agricultural Society, Joint Keeper (captain) of Swimming, House Captain of Games and House Captain.
      When he was nine-years-old, he needed surgery and 24 stitches for a depressed fractured skull in 1991 when he was he accidentally hit over the head with a club by a friend at Ludgrove prep school in Berkshire.
      In 2004, he was selected for the Scottish Universities water polo team after succeeding trials in Fife, Scotland. His uniform is number 12.
      Was elected to the Eton Society (or Pop), the main prefectorial body for the school. It started in 1811 as a debating society, named for the original venue for meetings in Mrs Hatton's lollipop shop which then stood on a site next to Manor House, where Prince William lived at Eton. It is now like a student monitor position in which he helped to supervise his fellow 1,280 classmates.
      When he was younger it was reported that he did not wish to follow family tradition and join the Royal Navy. His uncle, Earl Spencer, stated in 1999 that William did want to go into the armed forces. But in 2003 the BBC reported that he said that he didn't want to pursue a military career, which is what his brother, Harry has announced he will do. Instead, he said he wishes to do environmental work in Africa and is trying to teach himself Swahili.
      Prior to entering the University of St Andrews in Scotland he took part in military exercises with the Welsh Guards.
      Became patron to the UK charity Centerpoint, which works with homeless young people. During his mother's patronage of the organization, he would occasionally accompany her on visits (September 2005).
      With his father, 'Prince Charles', and brother, Prince Harry Windsor, was interviewed by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly for The Prince's Trust 30th Birthday: Live (2006).
      Proposed to Kate Middleton during holiday in Kenya in October 2010. News of the engagement was announced publicly on 16 November 2010.
      After being married to Kate Middleton, he and his wife were given the titles of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Earl and Countess of Strathearn (used in Scotland only), and Baron and Baroness Carrickfergus (used in Northern Ireland only) by his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.
      Has poor eyesight, and has to wear glasses whenever flying, always with a pilot by his side. He also needs them to drive, but he rarely wears them in public.
      His exercise regime from the Canadian Air Force consists of 11 minutes of stomach crunches, push-ups, stretches and running on the spot like his father and grandfather Prince Philip. Its easier to do in his own room.
      Almost dropped out of university until Kate Middleton convinced him he needed it. She always treated him like any other student, which is just what he wanted. They used to sing karaoke together. He also did all of his own shopping as a student.
      William sat in on his first meeting of The Way Ahead, the Monarchy's inner sanctum in Christmas, 2005.
      Rides a motorbike. He enjoys sport bike riding and owns a 600cc Triumph Daytona. His protection officers and wife don't approve of this hobby.
      William gave his mother's engagement ring to Kate Middleton. He proposed on the slopes of Mount Kenya. He did not ask Michael Middleton's approval to marry Catherine prior to his official proposal of marriage in Kenya, just in case Michael said no. (Refer to William and Catherine's engagement interview.).
      The most senior member of the Royal Family to train at Sandhurst Military Academy. He had always wanted to join the Army Air Corps as a helicopter pilot; not serve in the Guard's regiment like his brother.
George Alexander Louis, Prince of Cambridge, born to William and Kate Middleton at St. Mary's Hospital, the hospital William was born at. He is third in line to the British throne. [July 22, 2013].
      (about becoming King) I am worried about it, but I don't really think about it too much because there's no point in worrying about things which are not really present yet. It's not that I never want to do it, it's just that I'm reluctant at such a young age to throw myself in at the deep end.
      [why he gave Kate Middleton his mother's engagement ring] She (Princess Diana) can't share in any of the fun and excitement of it all. This was my way of keeping her close to it.
      The thing is with me, I look on the brighter side of everything. There's no point being pessimistic or being worried about too many things because frankly life's too short.
      She (Diana) understood more than any other Royal that the press can be wooed over if you know how.
      The last thing I want to do is be mollycoddled or wrapped up in cotton wool, because if I was to join the Army, I would want to go where my men went, and I'd want to do what they did. I would not want to be kept back for being precious, or whatever-that's the last thing I would want.
      I'm very much the person who doesn't want to rush into anything without really thinking it through. I don't shy away from doing particular events but I do like to go to the ones that I really feel passionately about.
      [on baby Prince George Alexander Louis' hair, August 2013] He's got way more than me. Thank God.

							Boisterous and at times rebellious as a child, Prince William of Wales has matured into a strong, sensitive man, who is the pride, not just of his family, but the nation as well. 						
						Born William Arthur Philip Louis Windsor on June 21, 1982, he is the eldest son of Diana, Princess of Wales and Prince Charles,  the Prince of Wales. 
From an early age he was already breaking with tradition. His mother gave birth in St Mary's Hospital, London making him the first direct heir to the throne to be born outside palace walls. Unlike his father and paternal grandmother, who had private tutors, he also attended nursery school. 
In 1995, after spells at Wetherby and Ludgrove Prep Schools, he started at Eton College, one of Britain's most prestigious secondary schools. There he excelled at sports – particularly swimming – and settled down to become a serious student. 
His parents divorced in 1996, and the following year he was hit with the devastating news of his mother's death in a car crash in Paris. With immense courage he insisted on walking behind Princess Diana's hearse in the funeral procession. 
A year later, William issued a joint statement with his younger brother, Prince Harry, asking both press and public to let the two of them get on with their lives in peace. 
It was a tactic which proved largely successful, and the Prince voiced his appreciation at the tenth anniversary of the Press Complaints Commission in February 2001, his first official engagement.
After graduating from Eton with 12 GCSEs and three A-levels, William decided to study art history at the University of St Andrews in Scotland enrolling simply as "William Wales". 
Before embarking on his studies in 2001, William took a gap year travelling  to Chile, Kenya and New Zealand to carry out community and conservation work. Meanwhile, student applications skyrocketed at St Andrews. 
In an interview before the start of his course, William insisted he planned to continue as normal a life as possible. "I just want to go to university and have fun I want to be an ordinary student," he said, adding: "I'm only going to university. It's not like I'm getting married." 
Eighteen months into his studies, the Prince admitted his adjustment at St Andrews had been quite a rocky. "It's new surroundings, new scenery and I wasn't quite sure what to expect," he said in the run-up to his 21st birthday. 
Feeling "a little uneasy", and unsure about whether to continue or drop out, he went home during the holidays to get some solid advice from dad. "My father was very understanding about it and realised I had the same problems he probably had... In the end I definitely realised that I had to come back."
 Friendship blossomed into romance and the Berkshire lass proved a hit with his father and brother, when she joined them on family holidays.
Whilst William remained reticent about marriage, royal observers noted that Kate's ever-increasing presence in the young Prince's life might soon lead to wedding bells. 
In 2007, just when it was thought an engagement was imminent, the duo went their separate ways. Royal watchers realised the break up was temporary when the pair were spotted kissing passionately and dancing closely at a party held in William's Army barracks.
The split had no doubt been prompted by the future King's desire to focus on his military career. He'd graduated from Sandhurst military academy the previous year, before going on to RAF Cranwell, where he earned his pilot's wings, leading to a post with the search and rescue service.
Engagement speculation once again reached fever pitch in 2010, following a visit by Kate's parents to Birkhall – Prince Charles’s private residence on the Balmoral estate. 
Clarence House confirmed that William had indeed presented his sweetheart with Princess Diana's iconic sapphire ring and the couple were to wed the following year. 
On April 29, 2011, they exchanged vows in a magnificent ceremony and became known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. 
The unity and rapport between the couple meant the royal family was riding high on a wave of popularity. Wherever they went large crowds turned out, resulting in unprecedented coverage of their tour of North America, the Diamond Jubilee and the 2012 Olympic Games.
Eighteen months after their wedding the Duke and Duchess announced they were expecting their first baby. On 22 July at 4.24 pm Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge was born.
Named after the Queen's father and grandfather he is expected to reign as George VII some time towards the end of the 21st century. Britain celebrated the birth of the new royal heir with gun salutes in Green Park and the Tower of London, while the bells of Westminster Abbey rang for three hours continuously.

He was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Buckingham Palace on 4 August 1982. His parents divorced in 1996 and his mother Princess Diana was killed in a car accident in 1997. He and his brother Harry had to endure intense media interest following the death and funeral of Diana.  He attended primary and prep schools in London and then Ludgrove school in Berkshire, before going to Eton College from July 1995 where he studied Biology and History of Art at A level. He was a keen on swimming and football and was captain of his house team. During a gap year in 2000/2001 he visited Belize in S. America where he took part in an army training exercise, Chile where he worked on a dairy farm as a volunteer with Raleigh International, and 15 weeks studying conservation in Africa. On his return he entered the University of St Andrews in Scotland where he started on a degree in History of Art but later changed to Geography. He graduated in 2005 with a 2.1 degree in Geography. In January 2006 he became an officer cadet at Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst joining his brother who had been there since May 2005. He passed out on 15 December 2006 at a parade attended by the Queen and the Prince of Wales and received a commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Blues and Royals regiment.

As one of the worlds most eligible bachelors, his relationship with his long-term girlfriend Catherine (Kate) Middleton whom he met at University in 2001 was closely followed by the media. Her family has a middle class background with no titled connections. Their 9 year relationship was the centre of considerable media attention and included threats of legal action over harassment from the press, a break up for a few months in 2007 and statements at the time that they were just good friends, however they were increasingly seen together at public events. Prince William is reported to have asked her to marry him during a holiday in Kenya, and the engagement ring belonged to his late mother Diana.  The engagement was announced on 16 November 2010, and they were married on 29 April 2011 in Westminster Abbey.  Prince William and Catherine were made Duke and Duchess of Cambridge by the Queen on their marriage. They live in North Wales where Prince William is a serving helicopter pilot in the Royal Air Force.

He is second in line to the British throne after his father Charles, Prince of Wales. If he accedes to the throne after his father he will become King William V and his wife Queen Catherine. Their first child Prince George was born on 22 July 2013.

1 family, 5291 historic attractions and counting ... the Britain Express family - passionate about British heritage! 
As the Royal party partook of a Mediterranean cruise around the Greek islands on the yacht Alexander this summer, the Prince of Wales had good reason to be proud of his elder son. Showing not only his emotional sensitivity, but a mature understanding of his father’s needs, Prince William suggested that Charles’s long-term companion Camilla Parker Bowles be invited join the party. Otherwise, the Prince noted, his father would be forced to spend a month apart from Mrs Parker Bowles: during the luxury 10-day cruise, and afterwards for the traditional two-week break at Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish residence. The cruise, one commentator noted, appeared to mark the end for the 17-year-old Prince of a two-year period of grief and upheaval.
In the early hours of August 31, 1997, while holidaying at Balmoral, William awoke to the news that his mother and her lover had been fatally wounded in a car accident in Paris. In the two years that have followed, William has shown courage and maturity beyond his years, and has transformed from a shy teenager, with his loyalties torn between love for his mother and duty towards his father, into an independent, strong-willed young man with the destiny of the Monarchy on his shoulders.
The elder son and heir of the Prince and the late Princess of Wales was born on June 21, 1982 in the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London, weighing in at at 7lb 10oz after a lengthy labour. The boy was christened William Arthur Philip Louis Windsor, with water from the River Jordan, in the music room of Buckingham Palace on August 4, 1982, coinciding with the 82nd birthday of the Queen Mother.
Both parents wanted William, and later Harry, to have as normal a childhood as possible. Unlike previous heirs to the throne, who were educated at home by private tutors at the same age, William’s formal education began at the age of three at Mrs Mynor’s Nursery School in Notting Hill Gate, West London. It continued at Wetherby, a nearby preparatory day school, where emphasis was placed on music and manners.
At first, Princess Diana was against sending William to boarding school. Prince Charles, remembering the misery of his own schooldays, equally did not want his son to suffer as he had at Gordonstoun. But for reasons of security, a compromise was reached. Aged eight, William was sent to Ludgrove Preparatory School in Wokingham, Berkshire, where he boarded on weekdays only. His school reports revealed his talent on the sports field, where he impressed as a rugby and hockey team captain, a crack shot, an excellent football and basketball player, and a school representative at cross-country running and swimming.
Diana described him as “the man in my life”, and the most photographed woman in the world relied upon her elder son for comfort and advice. Their relationship was close: Wills even announced that he wanted to be a policeman when he grew up, so that he could protect his mother. (“You can’t,” Harry observed, “you’ve got to be King.”) On one occasion, when Diana locked herself in the bathroom after an argument with Charles, it was William who pushed tissues under the door with a note saying: “I hate to see you sad.” By the age of nine, he had already learned to book a table at San Lorenzo, her favourite restaurant, to cheer up his mother. It was William who later advised her to accelerate her divorce proceedings by agreeing to be stripped of the title HRH, reassuring her: “You’ll still be Mummy.”
In turn, “Mummy” took William on a number of visits to meet the homeless and the dying, to make him aware of others’ suffering. “I want William and Harry to experience what most people already know,” Diana told an interviewer. “That they are growing up in a multi-racial society in which everyone is not rich, or has four holidays a year, or speaks standard English and drives a Range Rover.”
At 13, William was sent to Eton College, close to Windsor, a choice well-suited to a boy with a public future, not least because his new classmates would be as well-connected and as well-heeled as he: the Prince would not even be the only boy with a private detective. It became a regular arrangement that, on Sunday afternoons at 4pm, he would take tea with the Queen at the castle on the hill, where they continue to discuss William’s Royal duties – which at this stage include scheduling official photo calls and the occasional walkabout. William is not likely to begin taking on his own major Royal duties until he has completed his education. Unlike his father, there will be no formal title awaiting Prince William when he comes of age.
William developed an early sensitivity to the needs of others. Aged 14, he took the bold step of asking his parents not to attend the most important day in the school calendar, Eton’s Fourth of June celebrations, as he believed the presence of the press and bodyguards would spoil this Parents’ Day for his peers. Charles and Diana were both taken aback when he instead invited Tiggy Legge-Bourke to attend. Engaged by Prince Charles as unofficial nanny to the boys, Ms Legge-Bourke, whose mother was appointed Lady-in-Waiting to the Princess Royal, is a close companion with whom William feels naturally at ease. With a sense of fun that delights both William and Harry, Ms Legge-Bourke has noted: “I give the Princes what they need – fresh air, a rifle and a horse.”
William continues to flourish at Eton. His housemaster Dr Andrew Gailey, a respected constitutional historian and music lover from Northern Ireland, has taken William under his wing educationally and emotionally, and has been an important influence as William has sought to rebuild his life. Having proven to be the fastest junior swimmer at Eton in 10 years, from this term William will captain the swimming team, holding the title of Joint Keeper of Swimming. His duties include team selection, greeting visiting teams, keeping records, training new boys, and recommending swimmers for their colours. William has also been appointed secretary of the renowned Agricultural Club, and recently received Eton’s Sword of Honour, the school’s highest award for a first-year army cadet. In addition, senior pupils have elected him to the élite Eton Society, one of the highest honours bestowed on boys at the top of the school. The exclusive club, known as “Pop”, is a selection of the 11 most popular and respected boys going into the upper sixth. William will ensure that younger boys attend a daily chapel service, serve as an usher at school plays, and gain the authority to fine pupils who break the school rules.
“My boy’s got a good brain,” Diana would note proudly, “considering how hopeless both his parents were.” And close to the first anniversary of his mother’s death, William, who had gained three GCSE passes the previous year, received a further nine GCSEs with top A* and A grades in English, history and languages, and Bs for other subjects including maths and science. He returned for his final year at Eton on September 8 to take geography, English and history of art at A level.
It was long presumed that the Prince would follow in his father’s footsteps by attending Trinity College, Cambridge. This decision had been made for Charles by a committee of advisers, but William will be given more freedom. “God help anyone who tells William what to do,” observed one courtier. “He listens, but he won’t be pushed around by the system.” Indeed, William has told friends that he wishes to attend Cambridge only if his grades merit a place, and that rather than gain favouritism he would rather attend one of his four other choices. These are Edinburgh, St Andrews, Bristol and Durham universities, all of which the Prince has recently visited. History of art is likely to be his chosen subject. An army career will probably follow. “In the medium term, William wants to go into the armed services in some form,” says his uncle, Earl Spencer. “It is a traditional part of the Royal upbringing, but he would actually like to do it of his own volition.”
William values his privacy as well as his independence. At St James’s Palace, where he and Prince Harry share an apartment with their father, William has his own suite of rooms to which only he holds the key. He recently asked his father if he could convert the cellars of Highgrove House, the Gloucestershire home of the Prince of Wales, into his own flat. So far Papa is undecided. Like any other teenager, the second-in-line to the throne listens to techno music, selects all his own clothes, and enjoys playing computer games. For his seventeenth birthday, William was given a VW Golf car by Charles, and soon afterwards passed his driving test at the first attempt. He had been driving on the private roads of the Royal estates from the age of 13, but received just 20 hours of tuition from Police Sergeant Chris Gilbert, an expert in anti-hijack and counter-surveillance techniques, before passing his test in a silver Ford Focus on loan to the Royal Estate. The Prince was praised by his instructor for his “natural flair for driving”, and will continue lessons to make him more confident at night and motorway driving.
Recently, William has taken up his father’s beloved sport of polo, despite being a left-handed player in a game which favours the right-handed. Although he is not always comfortable in the public gaze, all eyes were on William when he made a low-key appearance in the company of the new young polo set at the Cartier International Polo Day at Smith’s Lawns, Windsor, this season. At six-foot one-and-a-half-inches tall, with self-assured elegance and those coy, head-lowered glances inherited from his mother, William has become the focus of much female attention – which embarrasses him terribly. He has chosen to socialise only with girls from families known to him. Informal dates are out of the question, and any future girlfriends will be thoroughly vetted to exclude the unsuitable and welcome the socially preferred. He only has to mention his interest in a young lady for an approach to be made to her parents by St James’s Palace. Mother and daughter will then be invited to tea or a party. Similarly, if William appears to be getting on well with a classmate’s sister or friend, networking will go on behind the scenes and introductions made. His circle includes Lady Iona Douglas Home, Holly Branson, Emilia D’Erlanger and Zara Simmonds, among many other attractive young women.
“William has so much sheer personal confidence for his age, but it has absolutely nothing to do with his position,” observes one Royal insider. “At the same age, his father was a mess of uncertainties. William always seems to know where he’s going and he always gets what he wants.” As he reaches adulthood, Prince William has already demonstrated that he possesses the maturity, sensitivity and strength he will need to rise to his destiny as the future of the Monarchy.
Rebecca RiotsThe riots, in south and mid Wales, were a protest against high taxation and tolls. A major target of protesters (usually men dressed as women) were toll gates.
