Adam Young (born July 5, 1986) is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Young began his musical career by creating small musical projects which he promoted on PureVolume or MySpace. In 2002, Young, with Anthony and Andy Johnson, co-founded the band Windsor Airlift, which has released five studio albums to date.
Young's electronic music project Owl City, created in 2007, has enjoyed significant popularity throughout its history. Posting songs to MySpace and iTunes, Young sold 2,000 tracks per week. Young, under Owl City, independently released Of June in 2007 and Maybe I'm Dreaming in 2008. In 2009, Young gained mainstream popularity after signing a deal with the record company Universal Republic and releasing the quadruple-platinum[1] song "Fireflies", from the album Ocean Eyes.
Young has also fronted several other musical projects, such as Sky Sailing and Port Blue. He is also co-founder of Swimming With Dolphins.
In late 2002, Adam Young, with his childhood friends Anthony and Andy Johnson, founded the punk-pop band, Windsor Airlift. The band released The Basement EP in April 2003 and subsequently began performing at several local shows. Over the next several years, the band released multiple albums and extended plays as well as changed their genre from punk-pop to math rock, and ultimately to ambient post-rock which they are most known for. Though he is still technically in the band, Young ultimately became inactive in the group's life after the 2009 success of Owl City's Ocean Eyes. This, along with Owl City and Port Blue, is one of Young's biggest musical projects to date.
In 2004, Andy Johnson, Anthony Johnson, and Adam Young created an electronic project called The Atlantic.[2][3] The group released a few songs before the band went dormant for a number of years.
In 2010, Andy and Anthony Johnson then reformed the project under the name Glacier Island. Since then, the group has released two studio albums entitled From Pelican Shores (2010)[4] and The Campfire Lullabies (2012).[5][6][7] Young has not been involved with the project since its resurrection and reform.
In 2005, Adam Young released a three-song project entitled Aquarium.[10] Like Novel, the project's genre was electronic screamo.
In 2005, Adam Young was drummer in a heavy screamo band called Isle.[11][12] Fellow touring member and friend Michael DeMars (Windsor Airlift) was also in the band.
In 2005, Adam Young, Andy Johnson, and Anthony Johnson created a three-song project entitled Charlton Heston and the Blast Beats.[13] The project's sound was humorous as it was a merging of a recording of Charlton Heston yelling (from the original Planet of the Apes film) with the band while pounding on a drum set.
In 2005, Adam Young created a three-song project entitled Can You Smell What The Rock Is Cooking?[14] The project's genre was funk/experimental music. The project made use of sound bites from movies and sport newscasters.
Young created many other projects in 2005 (some of which Andy and Anthony Johnson were involved in) including American Jesus,[15] Apes With Guns,[16] Beat Master Deluxe,[17] Blue Dallas,[18] Half Nelson Flying Corkscrew Clothesline,[19] Join The Dark Side, You Knob (a Star Wars inspired project),[20] Slam Dance,[21] Slingshot Powerbomb,[22] Spinning Skull Smash,[23] The Wellington Giggle-Bomb Experience,[24] Tombstone Piledriver,[25] and Understory.[26]
Among the genres of the projects, many were garage rock and instrumental. A few projects were experimental, funk, comedic, and variations of screamo.
In 2006, Adam Young, Andy Johnson, and Anthony Johnson started a band called Basketball.[27] The band's genre was pseudo rap and made use of the normal rag talk that goes along with the sport of basketball. The project released a couple "promotional"/music videos on Windsor Airlift's YouTube channel.[28][29][30] Young was in a wheelchair for part of the project's life, possibly from injury.
In 2006, Adam Young, Andy Johnson, Anthony Johnson created a one-song project called Chester McWiggins and the Kowboy Kidz.[31] The project poked fun at stereotyped yokels and ran on puns about guns, county fairs, and taking care of horses.
In 2006, Adam Young and Andy Johnson created a project called El Uno Clarence, The One Clarence.[32] The project's genre was heavy rock with lots of drums.
In 2006, Adam Young created a project called Keehar.[33][34] The project's genre was instrumental rock. The name of the project was based off Kehaar, the black-headed gull from Watership Down.
In 2006, Adam Young created a project entitled Riders of Rohan.[35] The genre of the project was experimental. The name of the project was based off the Riders of Rohan in The Lord of the Rings.
In 2006, Adam Young created a project called Seagull Orchestra.[36] The project was mostly instrumental, however one song, entitled "Sailboats", had vocals. The song was later re-written and re-recorded for Sky Sailing's An Airplane Carried Me to Bed.
Young created a few other projects in 2006 including Brother Reed, You Have Messed Up My Afro,[37] Nuclear Suplex,[38] and The Sports.[39]
In 2007, Andy Johnson, Anthony Johnson, and Adam Young created the ambient instrumental project, Dolphin Park.[40] The project released four songs which were later converted and re-recorded into Windsor Airlift's 2008 EP, Beneath The Crystal Waves. Windsor Airlift's recurring single, "The Theme for Moonglow", also originated from the project.
In 2007, Adam Young created a project entitled Insect Airport.[41] The project's genre was electronic instrumental with drums. The project is very similar to Port Blue.
In 2007, Adam Young created a two-song project called The Grizzly.[42] The project's genre was experimental. It consisted of Young synthesizing his voice deeply to sound like a "grizzly bear" who was obsessed with food.

Young began creating music in his parents' basement while suffering from insomnia.[43] Working alone, Young created a new project in 2007 under the name Owl City. Posting his songs to MySpace and iTunes, Young sold about 2,000 tracks a week[44] and quickly developed a MySpace following.
Young's first musical release under Owl City, Of June, debuted on April 21, 2007. The extended play reached No. 15 on the US Dance/Electronic Albums chart. It has seven tracks, and one, "Hello Seattle", was re-released with Ocean Eyes.
Young's first full-length album, Maybe I'm Dreaming, was released on December 16, 2008, and reached No. 13 on the US Electronic Albums chart.
In 2009, Young signed a deal with the record company Universal Republic. Under this new label, Young released his second full-length album Ocean Eyes and re-released his two previous albums. A single on the album, "Fireflies", sold 650,000 copies in its first week and was the iTunes Single of the Week. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Ocean Eyes reached the top ten in the US album charts and topped the US rock and electronic charts. In February 2010, iTunes released their list of highest-selling songs since 2003 with "Fireflies" listed at No. 24.[45]
After the success of Ocean Eyes, Young began touring internationally. The touring band consisted of Young, Breanne Düren, Matthew Decker, Laura Musten, and Hannah Schroeder. A deluxe version of Ocean Eyes was released on January 26, 2010.
Young released his third album, All Things Bright and Beautiful, on June 14, 2011. The album reached No. 1 on the iTunes Top 10 Electronic Albums in both the US and Canada and received an average of 4.5 stars from customers. The album includes three singles, "Deer in the Headlights", "Alligator Sky", and "Galaxies". The album has[46] a track only available in Japan and the UK, "Shy Violet".
Young stated on his blog in January 2012 that his next album would have the artists JR Rotem, Dr. Luke, Stargate, Brian Kennedy and Emily Wright on board for writing and producing. On May 15, 2012, Owl City released a four-song EP entitled Shooting Star, and later announced that the new album would drop on August 14, which was later changed to August 21. In late May, Young made a four-quadrant revealing cover art event, revealing each of the four squares when 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, and finally 20,000 people share on Facebook or Twitter. On May 29, 2012, the official cover art was revealed. Originally referenced on Twitter as #OCTMS, the OC part being Owl City, TMS was announced as The Midsummer Station. The first single off the album was "Good Time" (featuring Carly Rae Jepsen), the second being "Shooting Star". "Good Time" was released on June 26 on iTunes, and posted to Owl City's SoundCloud account on June 22.[citation needed]
Port Blue is Young's one-man project used for his experimental instrumental, ambient and post-rock productions. Under this name Young has released one album, The Airship (2007), and one EP, The Albatross (2008). Besides Owl City, Port Blue is Young's main project.[47]
A great deal of his most successful Port Blue material still remain officially unreleased. Among these is the album How I Became a Sailor, which includes the popular tracks "Seagulls", "Setting Sail", "On Marlin Isle" and "Asleep in the Yacht". Furthermore, the unreleased 2006 Port Blue album Arctic that holds tracks such as "Snow Fox on Glacier Coast", "Glider" and "Deep Iceberg". The 2004/05-produced EP The Pacific—includes prominent tracks "Base Jumping", "Pond Skater" and "Blue Marlin"—remains unreleased.
'Port Blue' is music that can be heard playing in elevators, hotel lobbies, airports, museums and restaurants inside my head. It is the soundtrack to my dreams. If I wrote music for movies, this is what my film scores would sound like. Much of the aesthetic of Port Blue is not what lies in the recordings but rather what is extracted from them...Dreamscapes. No vocals.
In my opinion, there is a huge lack of imaginative, unconventional music being created by artists today and what little there is, goes widely unappreciated by the masses. 'Port Blue' is my attempt at re-creating the music I want to hear and the emotions I want to feel.
I hope you enjoy my art as much as I enjoyed creating it. If by chance you ever feel as though you've come to know these songs, please consider yourself a friend because in a manner of speaking, you know me. This music is my heart and soul. This is who I am. (Adam R. Young, 2006)[this quote needs a citation]
I write a lot of ambient music in a solo project by the name of Port Blue which is largely inspired by bands like Unwed Sailor, Boards of Canada and Hammock. I love the idea of creating wordless abstract music without telling a listener specifically what to think or how to feel. It feels limitless because you can go anywhere, do anything or be anyone in your mind. You can let your imagination go and there’s no telling where it might take you. I find my escape in instrumental soundscapes and I definitely plan on writing and releasing more records under Port Blue. It’s very dreamy stuff.[48]
June 2012 Young uploaded three new Port Blue productions to his official Tumblr account.[citation needed]
On March 7, 2013, the unreleased Port Blue EP The Pacific was uploaded to the official Port Blue Soundcloud account—soundcloud.com/portbluemusic. The Pacific is a five-track EP, produced back in 2004–2005.
Sky Sailing was started as Young's first solo project in 2007.[50] It is largely acoustic synthpop, recorded on piano, drum kit, and acoustic guitar. One album was released by the project, An Airplane Carried Me to Bed (on the Universal Republic Records label) on July 13, 2010. The album features some of the early recordings of Adam Young, before he toured as Owl City. It was made available through iTunes and physical CD release.[51]
For the project, Young donned a pilot's mask.[52][53][54] It has become the trademark look for Sky Sailing. Young also donned it during his time with Swimming With Dolphins.
I've kept these recordings secret for a long time and they've never seen the light of day until now. Long before Owl City was ever a spark of a flame, a lot of blue-collared working days were spent absentmindedly daydreaming about what would ultimately become this collection of songs. From the perfectionist musician's perspective, a song is never truly 'finished' but rather 'abandoned' and thus, after a lot of inspiration and reckless experimentation, I emerged from the basement with an 11 song record which I affectionately entitled, An Airplane Carried Me To Bed." - Adam Young
In 2008, Austin Tofte and Adam Young started the electronica band, Swimming With Dolphins.[55][56][57][58] The name of the band was derived, according to Tofte, from "some old Jacques Cousteau documentaries from the 80’s".[59] Though Young was never the front man or lead singer, he performed synths and programming for the act. He also served as the producer of the group.
For the act, Tofte and Young created trademark outfits. Tofte took on the appearance of a submariner wearing a classic scuba suit and Young donned a pilot's mask (which would later become Sky Sailing's trademark look).[60]
The band made its debut with the release of their 2008 EP, Ambient Blue.[61][62][63] In addition to the main release, the band also put out a cover version of Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" as B-sides single to the EP.[64] The song "Silhouettes", off the release, featured Breanne Düren, who then proceeded to join Owl City's live band shortly after. Later that same year, Tofte, along with Düren, provided Young with backing vocals for a few songs on his debut Owl City album, Maybe I'm Dreaming.
Young departed the band in late 2008 as Owl City's popularity began to increase. Alone, Tofte signed Swimming With Dolphins on to Tooth & Nail Records in mid-2010.[60][65] About a year later, Tofte released Swimming With Dolphin's first full-length album Water Colours under Tooth & Nail in 2011.[66][67][68] On August 5, 2011, Swimming With Dolphins uploaded the official music video for the first single off the record, "Sleep To Dream", via YouTube.[69]
After Young's departure, Tofte was joined by Sarah Beintker and Torrie James as part of his live band.[70] Beinker contributed her vocals to the songs "Holiday" and "Sleep To Dream" off Water Colours. The release also featured the artists Sunsun and Mod Sun (Derek Smith, formerly of Four Letter Lie).
Since 2011, Tofte has released a few singles independently under Swimming With Dolphins and had a successful kickstarter to fund the project's upcoming album, Catharsis.[71][72][73][74] In September 2013, Tofte did an interview with Chris Herlihy's weekly syndicated radio show and talked about the release.[75] Also in September, Swimming With Dolphins released a preview of the new album in the form of a single instrumental track, entitled "Tromsø", via SoundCloud.[76] The album is expected sometime within 2014.[77]
Young has remixed several songs by different artists (usually subtitled "Adam Young Remix"), including:
Something Corporate, Played in Space: The Best of Something Corporate – "I Woke Up in a Car" (2010)
Young resides in his hometown, Owatonna, Minnesota, where he writes and programs all his music. He has mentioned he has Asperger's syndrome,[79] and he has often referred to himself as being deeply shy and socially introverted. Young has said that he enjoys photography and considers himself to be an amateur photographer.[80] He identifies himself as a Christian, and writes about his faith on his blog and through his music.[81]
Young was an avid skateboarder in his childhood[84][85] and continues to do it presently in in his spare time.[86][87][88][89]
Ironically, despite the fact that many of his songs have oceanic themes, when Young was a child, he hated the beach.[90]
In high school, Adam Young's favorite movie was Heavyweights. His song "Gimme Burgers" from his 2005 side-project Can You Smell What The Rock Is Cooking?, is a tribute to the film.[93] Snippets of the movie's audio are also played in the background of multiple songs by Young's project: El Uno Clarence, The One Clarence.[32]
Through 2001-2003, Adam Young, and his childhood friends Andy and Anthony Johnson, created an amateur homemade movie entitled The Adventures of Flames Pond (the title being a pun and reference to James Bond). The movie was filmed in pieces over a period of a few years. The Adventures of Flames Pond was then released in segments on Windsor Airlift's official YouTube channel throughout late 2011 and 2012,[94][95][96][97][98] and then, in its entirety, on October 1, 2013[99](due to the success of Windsor Airlift's kickstarter for their album Music[100]). Besides the actual movie, two small videos entitled "Flames Pond's Theme Song" and "The Fuzzy Guy's Theme Song" were released as well.[101][102] The movie has gained a cult following from many Adam Young fans, as it takes a look at his youth.

Owl City is an American electronica project created in 2007 in Owatonna, Minnesota, one of several such projects by singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young. Young created the project while experimenting with music in his parents' basement. Owl City developed a following on the social networking site Myspace, like many musicians who achieved success in the late 2000s, before signing with Universal Republic in 2008.
After two independent releases, Owl City gained mainstream popularity with the 2009 major label debut album Ocean Eyes, which included the quadruple-platinum[1] single "Fireflies". The album was certified Platinum in the United States in April 2010.[1]
In 2011, Owl City released his third studio album, All Things Bright and Beautiful.[2] This was followed by The Midsummer Station in August 2012. Owl City has also recorded songs for animated films including Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, Wreck-It Ralph, The Croods and The Smurfs 2.
Suffering from insomnia while working loading Coca-Cola trucks in his hometown Owatonna, Minnesota, Adam Young began to compose music,[3][4][5] recording with a C-1 Behringer Microphone. Among the software that he began with was Reason from Propellerhead.[6][7] He began uploading songs recorded in his parents' basement to Myspace.[5][8] He started to receive favorable attention for his music and then helped cultivate this nascent fanbase by being an open and accessible web presence, responding to any messages he received and constantly posting blogs.[9] His manager Steve Bursky later highlighted the significance of Young's engaging online manner in building his following saying: "People feel like they know him, like they've got a direct connection to him because of how he approaches his connection with them online."[9] Through a deal with the digital aggregator CD Baby, he then started making the songs available for sale through iTunes.[9] In 2007, Owl City released an EP titled Of June, followed by the 2008 release of the album Maybe I'm Dreaming. Of June reached No. 15 on the Billboard Electronic Albums chart, and Maybe I'm Dreaming peaked on the same chart at No. 13.[10]
The viral phenomenon that was building through Myspace caught the attention of Universal Republic presidents Avery and Monte Lipman who approached Young with a view to signing the artist.[9] Republic recommended Young partner up with 27-year-old manager Steve Bursky of Foundations Artist Management and the two began working together in late 2008. When later asked by HitQuarters why the label chose him for a major label act given his relative inexperience, Bursky said:
"I think they saw Owl City as representing the future of our business. This idea of a kid in a tiny town in rural U.S. being able to make songs in his basement that sound like Top 40 radio could never have happened ten years ago. By hiring a young management company who understands the business circa 2011 over a seasoned industry vet, who might not understand the online spaces well, showed a lot of understanding of where this kid was going to end up having success."[9]
Owl City's label deal with Universal Republic was finally confirmed in February 2009.[11] According to Bursky there was initially some disagreement about the direction Owl City should follow, telling HitQuarters: "They were ready to send him into the studio with big producers and polish him up to try to become this thing that he wasn't. But we put our foot down and said, 'Look, the reason you signed this kid is because it's working. Whatever it is about him – his music, his interaction with his fans, his brilliance in the online space – these things are connecting with people, and as soon as you change that you lose what's special about this artist.' To their credit, they really listened and they got it."[9]
Ocean Eyes, Owl City's first full-length album and major label debut, was released on iTunes on July 14, 2009, with the physical release following on July 28, 2009. The album debuted at No. 27 on the Billboard 200. Owl City has released three official singles from this album: "Umbrella Beach", "Vanilla Twilight" and "Fireflies".[12] "Fireflies" topped the US and Canadian charts. Ocean Eyes reached the top ten on the US album charts, topped the US electronic charts, and also reached Amazon MP3's top 10 most downloaded album list. By April 2010, it was certified Platinum in the United States. On January 24, 2010, Owl City reached the No. 1 spot in the UK Top 40 Singles chart with "Fireflies". The song "Tidal Wave" also received significant airplay on Christian music radio stations.[13] On January 2, 2011, it was revealed "Fireflies" was the 20th most downloaded song of all time in the UK.[14]
Young was joined by Breanne Düren on several tracks; the most notable example of which is "The Saltwater Room". Owl City's live band consists of Breanne Düren (background vocals/keyboards), Casey Brown (drums), Laura Musten (violin), Hannah Schroeder (cello), and Daniel Jorgensen (vibes).[15] Relient K vocalist Matt Thiessen has toured and collaborated with Owl City on several tracks, including "Fireflies", where Matt can be heard providing the backup vocals. Young also produced Relient K's song "Terminals".
"Fireflies" was released as a free download on the game Tap Tap Revenge 3 by Tapulous. Prior to the July 14, 2009 internet release of Ocean Eyes, and the "Fireflies" single, Steve Hoover was hired as a director for a music video for "Fireflies". The video was to have had an exclusive premiere on MySpace,[16] but had been leaked onto YouTube and Dailymotion hours earlier. "Fireflies" became a big sleeper hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States for the week ending November 7, 2009.[17]
Owl City is featured on Soundtrack 90210 with a song titled "Sunburn", which was released on October 13, 2009.[18] Owl City has toured with The Scene Aesthetic, Lights, John Mayer, Maroon 5 and Brooke Waggoner. He was also guest featured in the soundtrack to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland with a song entitled "The Technicolor Phase" that had already been featured in his debut album.[19]
In 2010, Young revealed a new musical project known as Sky Sailing, which moved away from his usual electronica genre of music and introduced acoustic guitar and piano accompaniments into his work. The unrefined tracks were recorded in the summer of 2006 before he began making music as Owl City.[20] His first album under this new project is entitled An Airplane Carried Me to Bed, and was released July 13, 2010, via iTunes.[21]
In May 2010, Young collaborated with high-profile British electronic composer, producer, musician, and songwriter Nick Bracegirdle. Under his Chicane alias, Bracegirdle released the single "Middledistancerunner" on August 1, 2010, featuring Adam Young on vocals. This is the first single from the fourth Chicane album Giants. He also worked with famed Dutch producer Armin van Buuren, appearing on a track called 'Youtopia' from the van Buuren album Mirage. In September, "To the Sky" was officially released via iTunes on the soundtrack for Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'hoole. On October 25, 2010, Young released a cover version of the praise and worship song "In Christ Alone" as a streaming MP3 on his website.[22]
In November 2010, a new album called Flight was released on iTunes for one of his other musical projects, Windsor Airlift.[23] A new Christmas single called "Peppermint Winter" was also released during that month.
Production on Young's third studio album began around mid-2010, with Young being announced as the executive producer of the album.[24][25] On October 18, Young wrote an entry on his blog regarding his third studio album, saying that the album was nearing completion.[26]
In February 2011, the title of the album was announced to be All Things Bright and Beautiful and that the album would be released on May 17. However, on April 6, Young released a statement on his website, along with lengthy previews of four of his songs (Dreams Don't Turn to Dust, Alligator Sky Featuring Shawn Chrystopher, Galaxies, and Deer in the Headlights), that the release date for All Things Bright and Beautiful would be pushed back to June 14.[27]
"Alligator Sky" was released as the lead single from the album on iTunes. Later that month and in early April, tickets went on sale for the All Things Bright and Beautiful World Tour,[28][29][30] and All Things Bright and Beautiful became available for preorder.[31] The song, "Galaxies" would be released as the second single from the album.
The music video for "Alligator Sky" would released on May 6. Young discussed the concept in a making-of video posted on Owl City's VEVO account, "The concept is basically about these two guys who are leaving Earth. Rather than it being this very dark post-apocalyptic vibe, it's very optimistic, and so it's like people are excited to leave earth."[32]
"Deer in the Headlights", the third single from the album, was released on iTunes on May 23. In June of that year, All Things Bright and Beautiful was released on iTunes. Although only a few days prior on May 20, almost all of the album leaked onto the internet.[33] The music video for "Deer in the Headlights" was released. It features Young driving through the night in a replica of the DMC DeLorean featured from the Back to the Future trilogy.[34] Canadian musician Lights also makes a cameo appearance during the video.
"Lonely Lullaby" was released as a single on iTunes, which was previously available only to Owl City Galaxy members, on July 19. Young was interviewed in the August issue of Cliché Magazine. He also appeared on the cover of the magazine and the issue also featured some of Young's very own artwork. Later during the month of July at the Club Nokia concert in Los Angeles, Young announced that the concert was being filmed for a Live DVD. The recording was eventually released on iTunes in November 2011.[35]
In Young's final tour dates of 2011, he performed a new song entitled "I Hope You Think of Me".[36] On January 2, 2012, Young wrote an entry on his blog regarding his fourth full-length album. Young said that he would be collaborating with more producers and songwriters, saying that his new record "Marks a flying leap in this direction". Young expected the album to be released around late Summer to Fall 2012.[37] In an interview with Billboard, Young revealed that the new album is around 80–85% complete, and that Dr. Luke, JR Rotem, Norwegian production team Stargate, Brian Kennedy and Emily Wright are involved with the production of the album. He was also unsure whether "I Hope You Think of Me" would make the final tracklisting.[35]
Young, along with Jewel and Jay Sean, released a song in promotion of the Child Hunger Ends Here campaign by ConAgra Foods entitled "Here's Hope".[38][39] On April 17, 2012, "Dementia", a song by Young which was intended to be included on his upcoming album leaked onto the internet. The song features additional vocals by Mark Hoppus of Blink-182.[40]
Young announced via Twitter that a new EP entitled "Shooting Star" was to be released on May 15. The EP features four songs off his upcoming album. Young stated that he released the EP because he wanted to give his fans a clear taste of what his upcoming album would sound like.[41] On May 24, 2012, Young announced on Twitter that Owl City's fourth studio album would be titled The Midsummer Station,[42] and that it would be released on August 14, 2012, worldwide, apart from in the United Kingdom where it would be released on September 17, 2012.[43] On June 21, 2012, Young announced that the release date of the album would be pushed back to August 21, 2012, but the UK release date would remain the same.[44] On July 12, 2012, Young announced via Twitter that the UK release date would be pushed forward to August 20, 2012.[45]
Young announced via Twitter that he would be collaborating with Carly Rae Jepsen on a new song, claiming that it would be released on June 26, 2012.[46] On June 20, 2012, he released the single, "Good Time", via his SoundCloud account.[47][48] The song was released on iTunes on June 26, 2012. It received generally positive reviews from critics, including Billboard: "It only makes sense that he's joined by Jepsen...[on] a track that could become a radio staple for the rest of the summer,"[49] and Entertainment Weekly: "'Good Time' goes down easier than a frozen margarita at a beachfront tiki bar."[48] "Good Time" was written by Matt Thiessen, Brian Lee and Young himself.[50]
On August 8, Young announced through his email newsletter that he would be holding a "Release Day Listening Party" on August 21.[51] and would be doing multiple TV performances, including The Today Show on August 22.[51]
On August 18, Young released a small clip of a studio version of "I Hope You Think of Me". The following day, August 19, Young also released two demo songs: "Beautiful Mystery" and "Paper Tigers".[52][53]
On October 5, the single "When Can I See You Again?", from the Disney film Wreck-It Ralph, was released.[54]
On November 6, the EP Good Time (Remixes) was released, featuring many remixes, including one from Young himself.[55]
In mid-2012, Universal announced that subsidiary Universal Republic Records will be closed down, with the label's entire roster being transferred to Republic Records. Therefore all future Owl City material will be released on Republic Records.[56]
In December 2012, Young began working on Owl City's fifth studio album.[57] In January 2013, he revealed that his fifth album will contain more EDM songs than his previous studio efforts.[58] He hoped to record a song for the album with Ellie Goulding and claimed that his new album would be "edgy".[59]
In the meantime, Young worked on multiple songs for animated films and television commercials. On March 4, 2013, the single "Shine Your Way", featuring Young and Yuna, was released on iTunes from the soundtrack to The Croods.[60] Owl City performed a 90-second jingle for Oreo's "Wonderfilled" commercial in May 2013.[61] In June 2013, it was revealed that Owl City would appear on the The Smurfs 2: Music from and Inspired By Soundtrack. The track, called "Live It Up", was released in the soundtrack album.[62]
On July 4, 2013, Young confirmed that he would release The Midsummer Station - Acoustic EP on July 30, 2013. The EP contains acoustic versions of the songs "Good Time", "Shooting Star", and "Gold", taken from his latest studio album.[63][64] The EP also contains two previously unreleased tracks: "Hey Anna" and "I Hope You Think Of Me".[64][65]
On October 22, 2013, Owl City released the song "Light of Christmas", which features tobyMac.[66][67] The song was created for the 2013 VeggieTales Christmas movie Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas.[68][69]

From March 31 to April 2, 2014, Young revealed the album artwork for a single, "Beautiful Times", through his Instagram account.[70][71] "Beautiful Times" features violinist Lindsey Stirling and was released on April 8, 2014.[72][73] Young stated that he intends to release a steady "series of EPs" in 2014 rather than one larger recording.[74] On June 5, 2014, Young announced that the first extended play will be titled Ultraviolet. The recording will be released on June 27.[75][76][77]
Owl City's music is described as indietronica and synthpop and is often described as belonging under the "electronic music" genre.[78] Young has stated that he is inspired by disco and European electronic music, as well as instrumental genres such as drone, ambient, and post-rock. He cites his biggest influences as Johnathon Ford of Unwed Sailor and Thomas Newman. Young also incorporates some of his Christian faith into his music, since he is a vocal Christian.[79][80][81] Young's faith is evident on the album, "All Things Bright and Beautiful", especially in "Galaxies". Explaining why the faith-filled song was added to the mix, he said, "I feel like if I were ever to hide the fact that that's what's so important to me, it would be a crime, that I should probably be put in jail for that."[82]
Owl City also has been compared to The Postal Service, often critically, for his combination of fuzzy synths, ironic lyrics and use of female guest singers.[83] Pitchfork.com goes to say that "The surprise No. 1 single in the country, Owl City's 'Fireflies', jacks the Postal Service in such a bald-faced, obvious manner that getting into specifics feels redundant at best and tacky at worst."[84] In response to the suggestion that his work is derivative, Young suggested in a 2009 interview with The New York Times that Ocean Eyes is perhaps the "next chapter" after The Postal Service: "The Postal Service released a record in 2003, and that was it. There was really nothing to compare it to until some one else came along and wrote the next chapter. Maybe that's this record. Maybe that's this band."[85]
Owl City is one of Young's many solo projects, with all music written, composed, recorded, and produced by him. During live performances he is accompanied by a group of supporting musicians:[15][86]

Name: Adam Randal YoungDate of Birth: July 5th 1986 (currently 24 years old)Information: Adam, who is a born-again Christian as well as a staunch vegetarian, is a shy boy from Owatonna, Minnesota, who started creating music both alone in his basement and also with friends as a collaborative effort, while he was still in his teenage years, during high school, and wrote a lot of his songs about the girl he was in a relationship with at the time, Annmarie Monson. An insomniac, Adam started writing and recording music in his basement under the project name 'Owl City' while managing a day-time job at a local Coca Cola warehouse, and gained a lot of attention via MySpace, before later being signed by the record label Universal Republic, after releasing his unsigned EP album, 'Of June', in 2007.A year later he released a second album under the project name Owl City, called 'Maybe I'm Dreaming', but it wasn't until during 2009 when he released his third album, 'Ocean Eyes', that Adam's work was propelled to the limelight. His song 'Fireflies', track nine on the Ocean Eyes album, instantly became a massive hit internationally, being played on every radio station, and music television channel, at least once on a daily/regular basis.Adam also has many other musical projects besides Owl City, all of which can be found on this website or the wiki administrator's blog, here.He lists some of his inspirations as being:   God     Optimism     Photography     Air Travel     Vegetarianism     Fashion     Foreign Accents     Swimming Pools     Abstract Art     Wave Race 64     G-Rated Movies     Friends     Romance     Unwed Sailor     Stars of the Lid     Telefon Tel Aviv     Imogen Heap     Stairwell     DJ Encore     Prefuse 73     Rachel's     ATB     The Album Leaf     Helios     Sigur Rós     Boards of Canada     Hammock     Kazumi Totaka     Thomas Newman     Owen     Armin van Buuren     Rachel Joy Scott     Audrey Hepburn     C.

I follow Jesus Christ wholeheartedly. He is my life, my strength, my all.

Dyanova here.FIrstly, thanks to Steve for providing so much info about Adam. I didn't even know he was called Adam Randal Young (where did you find that one out?).Secondly, I want to address all Adam Young fans and non-Adam Young fans. I believe that Adam is an enigma. Like what I said in response to his blog, there is an ocean of mysteries that surround him and they’re begging to be unraveled.Sense. Am I "creating" it? Lol.Let me elaborate. Here are the questions that I would ask Adam if I ever meet him. I have always dreamed of being to meet Adam on a plane (hopefully a long flight), then we could sit together and talk about him and his songs all day, cos I have so much to ask him.1) You are a Christian? I want you to know that I love you a lot, so don't get the wrong idea. But why did you create songs like Behold Lawns from Novel? How would you explain the backgrounds screaming? Also, would you explain more about your projects that involve music with no vocals whatsoever. What significance do the songs have? Can you elaborate on the way you convey these messages/feelings?2) I love all your lyrics. They rock and are so meaningful. You can go to visit my blog at decipheringowlcity.blogspot.com to verify my interpretations. Some of the songs I would clarify the meaning there and then would be Rainbows Veins, Umbrella Beach, Fireflies... etc. etc... okay probably every song.3) What are some of the philosphies you have towards life, the world, its societies and a utopia?4) Are you still with Annmarie Monson?5) Can you explain your life before fame? How did you become famous? In the documentary by Pamela Littky, you said that it "took a couple of wake-up calls for me (you) to" realise that you could make a living from music. What were those wake-up calls? How did you realise you could "take to the sky"?(i will cont)
Very good questions, except for #4. *wince*Annmarie Monson died in a car accident. You can listen to a song he wrote to her here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=govSp6P-598It's called Lonely Lullaby.
(cont)6) what are some of the talents in music that you have? Do you believe that anyone can do music? I wanna do music but I can't. How are you so superb in literature?7) How do you find your backing band? Who do you like the most? Have you ever had any feelings for Breanne, Laura or Hannah? How about Melisa Morgan? Or Matthew Decker (just kiddin')?8) How does it feel like for you to be in love?9) Can I scrutinise you?10) etc.etc.etc....Yea.

In the state of Minnesota lies a small town called Owatonna with roughly twentytwo thousand inhabitants. Within that city is a quiet road with a modest house. In that house there's an unkempt basement with no windows. Within those confines you'll find Adam Young of Owl City hard at work on his electronic and melodically infectious music of simple and singular beauty.
Inside this "cave," as Adam likes to describe it, he has begun to quickly win over a large audience thirsty for something genuine, something sublime.
Being an only child in a small town, and having no musicians in his immediate family, Adam is hard pressed to say how it all started. Explaining that he always had a "push" to be creative, Adam picked up his first guitar in junior high school.
Growing up in a "sheltered bubble" and being one of the more shy kids around the neighborhood, Adam seemed compelled to lend his time and creative ideas to music.
"I've always been the shy guy, I don't see that changing, but I definitely feel a lot more comfortable than I anticipated. I can hide behind the music."
While his music continues to win followers all over the world, Adam does indeed hide behind his music, not going by his real name (See: Badly Drawn Boy and Dashboard Confessional); but going by the moniker Owl City. Adam was searching more for a mood when coming up with a title for his sound, rather than something easily identifiable. He goes on to explain that most of the artists that catch his eye have something unique about their name, something that lingers. So one has to ask: how did this Owl City phenomenon begin? How does a young artist writing songs underneath his garage, acoustic foam and books everywhere, reach an audience of millions?
"I'm still trying to figure it out," Adam laughs. "Back in June of 2007 it kind of started on a whim. My parents were away for the weekend, and wanting to be loud and make some noise and whatever, I began writing versions of what became my first, self released digital EP - Of June. I put it up on MySpace the following month and didn't tell anyone."
Word of mouth began to spread for Adam's music, with demands coming from various parts of the country for an album. Maybe I'm Dreaming, released digitally in March of 2008, was Owl City's full-length debut. The album has garnered great critical praise and is a clear representation of Owl City's progression as an artist.
Adam has become a phenomenon on MySpace with more than 7 million profile views and 40 million plays, which is outstanding in such a short span of time. It's clear that Owl City is making a colossal impact on the music scene.
As listeners on MySpace climb into the tens of millions, Owl City gets set to release his latest creation, Ocean Eyes. Loaded with amazing loops, catchy pickups, and lyrics that soothe the mind and touch the heart, Adam Young has once again created a lush listening experience.
Owl City's trademark desire to escape in dreams, oceans and sky abound on this, his first official CD, in songs such as "Cave In" and "Umbrella Beach." Adam also continues to display a terrific wit uncommon in most electronic based music in such songs as the clap infused, bouncy "Dental Care" (a humorous metaphor on smiling) and "Fireflies."
Given the official compact disc treatment, previously released fan favorite "Hello Seattle" gives the great Northwest its' due with an ode to highlands, parking lots, Puget Sound and albatross. With glorious vocal harmonies ("The Saltwater Room") and touching odes to love lost ("Vanilla Twilight") Adam has dug more deeply on Ocean Eyes lyrically and musically than ever.

=======================================================
Owl City is an American synthpop musical project by Adam Young. Young started out making music in his parents’ basement in Owatonna, Minnesota, later developing a following through his MySpace profile before being signed to Universal Republic.
Young’s influences are disco and European electronic music. After two independent albums, Owl City gained mainstream popularity from the 2009 major label debut album Ocean Eyes, which spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit single and UK #1 hit single “Fireflies“.
Owl City was started by Adam Young in his parents’ basement while he worked at a Coca-Cola warehouse,[1][2] turning to music as a result of his insomnia.[3] Young received much attention for songs he had uploaded to MySpace, the “viral popularity” of which would later result in his signing to Universal Republic.[3][4] In 2007, Owl City released an EP titled Of June, followed by the 2008 release of the album Maybe I’m Dreaming. Of June reached #20 on the Billboard Electronic Albums chart, and Maybe I’m Dreaming peaked on the same chart at #16.[5]
Owl City’s first two records were released while Young was unsigned. In early 2009, music industry website “Crazed Hits” leaked that Owl City signed with the major label Universal Republic.[6]
Owl City’s third album Ocean Eyes was released on iTunes July 14, 2009, with the physical release following on July 28, 2009. The album debuted at #27 on the Billboard 200. Owl City has released four singles, “Hello Seattle”, “Hot Air Balloon”, “Strawberry Avalanche”, and “Fireflies“.[7] “Fireflies” topped the US and Canadian charts and became the most-downloaded song on iTunes in the US. Ocean Eyes reached the top ten on the US album charts and topped the US electronic charts and also reached Amazon MP3′s top 10 most downloaded album list. By December 2009, it was certified Gold in the United States. On 24 January 2010, Owl City reached the number 1 spot in the UK Top 40 Singles chart with “Fireflies”.
Young is joined by Breanne Düren on several tracks; the most noted being “The Saltwater Room.” Owl City’s live band consists of: Breanne Duren (background vocals/keyboards), Matthew Decker (drums), Laura Musten (violin), and Hannah Schroeder (cello). He will likely collaborate with Lights in early 2010 on his new tour in the US, Asia, Australia and Europe.[8][9]
Relient K vocalist Matt Thiessen has toured and collaborated with Owl City on several tracks including in the hit single “Fireflies”, where Matt can be heard as the backup vocals. Young also produced Relient K’s song “Terminals”. Thiessen stated that it is very likely that he and Young will produce a side project called Goodbye Dubai in the future.[10]
“Fireflies” was released as a free download on the iPod/iPhone game Tap Tap Revenge 3 by Tapulous. Prior to the July 14, 2009 internet release of Ocean Eyes, and the “Fireflies” single, Steve Hoover was hired as a director for a music video for “Fireflies”. The video had an exclusive premiere on MySpace,[11] but was leaked onto the video viewing websites, YouTube and Dailymotion hours earlier. “Fireflies” became a big sleeper hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States for the week ending November 7, 2009.[12]
Owl City is featured on Soundtrack 90210 with a song entitled “Sunburn”, which was released on October 13, 2009.[13] Owl City has toured with The Scene Aesthetic and Brooke Waggoner.
On Monday, December 7, 2009 Owl City was shortlisted as one of the 15 acts for the BBC Sound of 2010.
Owl City has been stated to play within the musical genres of electronica, synthpop, emo and alternative.[14][15] Young has stated that he is inspired by disco and European electronic music[16] and also lists Imogen Heap, Relient K, Boards of Canada and Armin van Buuren as influential artists.[citation needed]
Owl City has been compared to The Postal Service, with a number of publications going as far as accusing Owl City of “ripping off” the Postal Service.[1][17][18][19][20][21][22] Adam Young, while admitting to being a fan of the Postal Service and acknowledging some influence, has dismissed the comparisons.[23]
