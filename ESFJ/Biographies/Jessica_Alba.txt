Alba later appeared in Honey (2003), Sin City (2005), Fantastic Four (2005), Into the Blue (2005), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) and Good Luck Chuck (2007).[4][5]
Alba has been called a sex symbol.[6] She appears on the "Hot 100" section of Maxim and was voted number one on AskMen.com's list of "99 Most Desirable Women" in 2006, as well as "Sexiest Woman in the World" by FHM in 2007.[7][8][9] In 2005, TV Guide ranked her # 45 on its "50 Sexiest Stars of All Time" list.[10] The use of her image on the cover of the March 2006 Playboy sparked a lawsuit by her, which was later dropped.[11] She has also won various awards for her acting, including the Choice Actress Teen Choice Award and Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television, and a Golden Globe nomination for her lead role in the television series Dark Angel.[4]
Alba was born in Pomona, California,[1] to Catherine (née Jensen) and Mark Alba. Her mother is of Danish and French Canadian descent and her father is of Mexican ancestry.[12] She has a younger brother, Joshua. Her father's Air Force career took the family to Biloxi, Mississippi and Del Rio, Texas, before settling back in Claremont, California, when she was nine years old.[3][12] Alba described her family as being a "very conservative family – a traditional, Catholic, Latin American family" and herself as very liberal; she says she had identified herself as a "feminist" as early as age five.[13]
Alba's early life was marked by a multitude of physical maladies. During childhood, she suffered from partially collapsed lungs twice, had pneumonia four to five times a year, as well as a ruptured appendix and a tonsillar cyst.[3] Alba became isolated from other children at school, because she was in the hospital so often due to her illnesses that no one knew her well enough to befriend her.[14] Alba has also had asthma since she was a child.[3] Alba has said that her family's frequent moving also contributed to her isolation from her peers.[13] She has acknowledged that she has suffered from obsessive–compulsive disorder during her childhood.[15][16] Alba graduated from Claremont High School at age 16,[17] and she subsequently attended the Atlantic Theater Company.[18]
Alba expressed interest in acting since the age of five. In 1992, the 11-year-old Alba persuaded her mother to take her to an acting competition in Beverly Hills, whose grand prize was free acting classes. Alba won the grand prize, and took her first acting lessons. An agent signed Alba nine months later.[3][18][19] Her first appearance on film was a small role in the 1994 feature Camp Nowhere as Gail. She was originally hired for two weeks but her role turned into a two-month job when one of the prominent actresses dropped out.[2]
Alba appeared in two national television commercials for Nintendo and J.C. Penney as a child. She was later featured in several independent films. She branched out into television in 1994 with a recurring role as the vain Jessica in three episodes of the Nickelodeon comedy series The Secret World of Alex Mack.[3] She then performed the role of Maya in the first two seasons of the television series Flipper.[2][3] Under the tutelage of her lifeguard mother, Alba learned to swim before she could walk, and she was a PADI-certified scuba diver, skills which were put to use on the show, which was filmed in Australia.[3][20]
In 1998, she appeared as Melissa Hauer in a first-season episode of the Steven Bochco crime-drama Brooklyn South, as Leanne in two episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210, and as Layla in an episode of The Love Boat: The Next Wave.[21] In 1999, she appeared in the Randy Quaid comedy feature P.U.N.K.S..[2] After Alba graduated from high school, she studied acting with William H. Macy and his wife, Felicity Huffman, at the Atlantic Theater Company, which was developed by Macy and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and film director, David Mamet.[18][22]
Alba rose to greater prominence in Hollywood in 1999 after appearing as a member of a snobby high school clique in the Drew Barrymore romantic comedy Never Been Kissed, and as the female lead in the 1999 comedy-horror film Idle Hands, opposite Devon Sawa.[5]
Her big break came when writer/director James Cameron picked Alba from a pool of 1,200 candidates for the role of the genetically engineered super-soldier, Max Guevara, on the Fox sci-fi television series Dark Angel. Co-created by Cameron, the series starred Alba, and ran for two seasons until 2002, earning her critical acclaim as well as a Golden Globe nomination.[5][23] Alba later admitted to suffering from anorexia while in preparation for Dark Angel.[24]
Alba has been well received in popular culture. She received the Teen Choice Award for Choice Actress and Saturn Award for Best Actress for her role in Dark Angel. In 2006, Alba received an MTV Movie Award for "Sexiest Performance" for Sin City.[4][9][25] Her acting has also drawn criticism, however, as she was nominated for a 2007 Razzie Award for Worst Actress for her performances in Awake, Good Luck Chuck, and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.[26] She was also nominated for the same award in 2005 for her performances in Fantastic Four and Into the Blue.[27]
Alba's most notable film roles have included an aspiring dancer-choreographer in Honey, exotic dancer Nancy Callahan in Sin City, and as the Marvel Comics character Sue Storm, the Invisible Woman in Fantastic Four. She then appeared in its sequel, in Into the Blue later that year, and Good Luck Chuck a few years later.[4][28][29] Alba hosted the 2006 MTV Movie Awards and performed sketches spoofing the movies King Kong, Mission: Impossible 3, and The Da Vinci Code.[30] In February 2008, she hosted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Science and Technical Awards.[31] Alba has been represented by talent agents Patrick Whitesell[32] and Brad Cafarelli.[11]
In 2008, Alba made her acting transition to the horror-film genre in The Eye, a remake of the Hong Kong original.[12][33] The film was released on February 1, 2008. Though the film was not well received by critics,[34] Alba's performance itself received mixed reviews. Alba won a Teen Choice for Choice Movie Actress: Horror/Thriller and a Razzie Award for Worst Actress-nomination.[35] Also in 2008, Alba starred alongside Mike Myers and Justin Timberlake in "box office bomb" The Love Guru. Alba was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actress.[4]
In late 2008, Alba signed on to star as the lead role in An Invisible Sign of My Own.[36] The movie finished filming in November 2008.[37] It premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival and was released to theaters in May 2011.[38][39]
In 2010, Alba starred in five films. She played Joyce Lakeland, a prostitute in The Killer Inside Me, film adaption of the book of the same name which co-starred Kate Hudson and Casey Affleck. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.[40][41][42][43] Her second film of the year was the hit romantic comedy Valentine's Day, directed by Garry Marshall.[44][45][46] She portrayed Ashton Kutcher's girlfriend, Morley Clarkson, in the ensemble film that included Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Garner, among others.[45][47][48] It was released on February 12, 2010.[48] Later in the year, she appeared in action film Machete, in An Invisible Sign of My Own and in Little Fockers, reuniting with Robert De Niro who was also in Machete.
In August 2010, it was announced that Alba would appear in Spy Kids 4.[49] The film was released a year later.
In January 2012, Alba and business partner Chris Gavigan launched The Honest Company, a collection of toxin-free household goods, diapers, and body care products.[50] In March 2012, Alba announced that she will be releasing a book, The Honest Life, based on her experiences creating a natural, non-toxic life for her family. The book, slated for release in early 2013, will be published by Rodale.[51]
Her next projects include comedy A.C.O.D.[52] and animated film Escape from Planet Earth.[53] Alba will also reprise her role as Santana in Machete's sequel Machete Kills[54] and as Nancy Callahan in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, sequel to 2005's Sin City.[55] Filming for Sin City started in October 2012 with a release date set for August 2014.[55]
In 2001, Alba was ranked No. 1 on Maxim magazine's Hot 100 list. She said that "I have to go to certain lengths to use sexuality to my advantage, while guiding people to thinking the way I want them to."[56] In 2005, Alba was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People, and also appeared in the magazine's 100 Most Beautiful list in 2007. In 2002, Alba was voted as the fifth Sexiest Female Star for 2002 in a Hollywood.com poll, No.4 in the Top 10 Sci-Fi Babes, No.6 in FHM's Sexiest Girls for their poll, and ranked at No.12 in Stuff magazine's "102 Sexiest Women in the World" 2002 edition.[57] In 2005, Alba was ranked at No.5 on the Maxim magazine's Hot 100 list.[58]
On the cover of the March 2006 issue, Playboy magazine named Alba among its 25 Sexiest Celebrities, and the Sex Star of the Year. Alba was involved in litigation against Playboy for its use of her image (from a promotional shot for Into the Blue) without her consent, which she contends gave the appearance that she was featured in the issue in a "nude pictorial". However, she later dropped the lawsuit after receiving a personal apology from Playboy owner Hugh Hefner, who agreed to make donations to two charities that Alba has supported.[11]
When reports surfaced that a 21-year-old Chinese girl was seeking plastic surgery to resemble Alba in order to win back an ex-boyfriend, the star spoke out against the perceived need to change one's appearance for love.[59]
In 2006, Alba ranked No.3 on E! Television's 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies. In 2006 readers of AskMen.com voted Alba No. 1 on 99 Most Desirable Women,[8] while in 2007, Maxim Magazine placed Alba on the number 2 spot of their "Top 100".[9] Both GQ and In Style had Alba on their June 2008 covers,[60][61] and in May, after eight million votes, FHM (UK and USA editions) named Alba the winner as "2007's Sexiest Woman in the World".[62] Alba has been regarded as one of the world's most attractive women, being named to Maxim's Hot 100 in 2008.[63] In 2007, Alba was ranked in at No.1 in FHM's Sexiest Girls of 2007 poll, in the magazine's Latvian edition. Alba was ranked No.4 on Empire Magazine's 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 2007. In 2006 and 2007, Alba was voted No.1 as the most sexy woman in the world by the Norwegian FHM.[58] Alba appeared in the 2009 Campari calendar. Campari printed 9,999 copies of the calendar featuring photos of Alba posing sexually in swimsuits, and high heels.[64] In 2008, Alba was ranked No.34 on Maxim magazine's Hot 100 list, was ranked No.2 on Wizard magazine's "Sexiest Women of TV" list, and was named in GQ Magazine one of the 25 Sexiest Women in film of all time.[58] Alba is the only woman who has made the Maxim Magazine Hot 100 list in all the years it was published; from 2000 to 2013.[65] She appeared on Maxim's 2013 Hot 100 list, finishing 17.[66] She was named one of the "100 Hottest Women of All-Time" by Men's Health.[67] People named her one of 2012 Most Beautiful at Every Age.[68]
"I think there are ambitious girls who will do anything to be famous, and they think men in this business are used to women doing that. Contrary to how people may feel, I've never used my sexuality. That's not part of it for me. When I'm in a meeting, I want to tell you why I'm an asset, how I'm a commodity, how I can put asses in the seats, not, 'There's a chance you're going to be able to fuck me.' That's never been my deal."
Alba fears being typecast as a sex kitten based on the bulk of parts offered to her, commenting, "Somehow, I don't think this is happening to Natalie Portman."[70] In the interview, Alba said she wants to be taken seriously as an actress but believes she needs to do movies that she would otherwise not be interested in to build her career, stating that eventually she hopes to be more selective in her film projects.[70] Alba also maintains a strict no-nudity clause in her contract. She was given the option to appear nude in Sin City by the film's directors, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, but declined the offer, saying, "I don't do nudity. I just don't. Maybe that makes me a bad actress. Maybe I won't get hired in some things. But I have too much anxiety".[71] She remarked of a GQ shoot in which she was scantily clad, "They didn't want me to wear the granny panties, but I said, 'If I'm gonna be topless I need to wear granny panties."[72] In March 2010, she reasserted her position to Scarlet magazine, saying, "I can act sexy and wear sexy clothes but I can’t go naked."[73] For the shower scene in Machete, she was wearing underwear, which was digitally removed afterwards.[73]
Alba was raised as a Catholic[74] throughout her teenage years,[75] but left the church after four years because she felt she was being judged for her appearance, explaining: "Older men would hit on me, and my youth pastor said it was because I was wearing provocative clothing, when I wasn't. It just made me feel like if I was in any way desirable to the opposite sex that it was my fault, and it made me ashamed of my body and being a woman".[76]
Alba also had objections to the church's condemnations of premarital sex and homosexuality, and what she saw as a lack of strong female role models in the Bible, explaining "I thought it was a nice guide, but it certainly wasn't how I was going to live my life."[71] Her "religious devotion [began] to wane" at the age of 15 when she guest-starred as a teenager with gonorrhea in the throat in a 1996 episode of the television series Chicago Hope. Her friends at church reacted negatively to her role, making her lose faith in the church.[3] However, she has stated that she still holds her belief in God despite leaving the church.[77]
While filming Dark Angel in January 2000, Alba began a three-year relationship with her co-star Michael Weatherly, which caused controversy due to their 12-year age difference.[78] Weatherly proposed to Alba on her twentieth birthday, which she accepted.[12] In August 2003, Alba and Weatherly announced that they had ended their relationship.[3] In July 2007, Alba spoke out about the breakup, saying "I don't know [why I got engaged]. I was a virgin. He was 12 years older than me. I thought he knew better. My parents weren't happy. They're really religious. They believe God wouldn't allow the Bible to be written if it wasn't what they are supposed to believe. I'm completely different."[79] Alba had at one time said she envisioned a much older man as her ideal partner, making references to Morgan Freeman, Sean Connery, Robert Redford, and Michael Caine. She said, "I have this thing for older men. They've been around and know so much."[80]
Alba met Cash Warren, son of actor Michael Warren, while filming Fantastic Four in 2004.[81][82] Alba married Warren in Los Angeles in May 2008.[83][84] They have two daughters: Honor Marie Warren (born 2008)[85][86] and Haven Garner Warren (born 2011).[87] The first pictures of Honor Marie appeared in the July 2008 issue of OK! magazine, which reportedly paid $1.5 million.[88]
In 2005, Alba offered her acting talents for free, to raise money for AIDS charity Amfar at the Cannes Film Festival. The Industry had held a benefit for the US research foundation. Alba had caused "the greatest stir" by promising to star as an unpaid actress in one of The Lord of the Rings producer Bob Weinstein's movies, if Weinstein agreed to bid $100,000 for tennis lessons with sports stars Monica Seles and Boris Becker.[89]
Alba's charity work includes participation with Clothes Off Our Back, Habitat for Humanity, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Project HOME, RADD, Revlon Run/Walk for Women, SOS Children Villages, Soles4Souls, and Step up.[90] Alba openly endorsed and supported Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama during the 2008 primary season.[91] Alba is an ambassador for the 1Goal movement to provide education to children in Africa.[92] She is also a strong supporter of gay rights and on June 27, 2013, she expressed her delight with the supreme court's decision to strike down DOMA on her Twitter account. She tweeted "#equality #love".[93]
Alba posed for a bondage-themed print advertising campaign by Declare Yourself, a campaign encouraging voter registration among youth for the 2008 United States presidential election. The ads photographed by Mark Liddell,[94][95] which feature Alba wrapped in and gagged with black tape, drew national media attention. The ads were described by some as being "Shocking".[95] Alba said of doing the advertisements that "it didn't freak me out at all." Alba also said "I think it is important for young people to be aware of the need we have in this country to get them more active politically," and "People respond to things that are shocking."[95]
In June 2009, while filming The Killer Inside Me in Oklahoma City, Alba was involved in a controversy with residents when she pasted posters of sharks around town.[96] Alba said that she was trying to bring attention to the diminishing population of great white sharks. Media outlets speculated that Alba would be pursued and charged with vandalism.[97] On June 16, 2009, Oklahoma City police said that they would not pursue criminal charges against Alba, because none of the property owners wanted to pursue it.[98][99] Alba apologized in a statement to People magazine and said that she regretted her actions.[98] She later donated an undisclosed amount of money (over $500)[100] to the United Way, whose billboard she had obscured with one of the shark posters.[101][102][103][104]
In 2011, Alba participated in a two-day lobbying effort in Washington D.C. in support of the Safe Chemicals Act, a revision of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.[105][106]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Born in Pomona, California, on April 28, 1981, Jessica Alba and her family moved to Biloxi, Mississippi, when she was an infant. Three years later, her Air Force father brought the family back to California, then to Del Rio, Texas, before finally settling in Southern California when Jessica was nine. In love with the idea of becoming an actress from the age of five, she was 12 before she took her first acting class. Nine months later, she was signed by an agent. A gifted young actress, Jessica has already played a variety of roles ranging from light comedy to gritty drama since beginning her career. She made her feature film debut in 1993 in Hollywood Pictures' comedy Camp Nowhere (1994). Originally hired for two weeks, she got her break when an actress in a principal role suddenly dropped out. Jessica cheerfully admits it wasn't her prodigious talent or charm that inspired the director to tap her to take over the part - it was her hair, which matched the original performer's. The two-week job stretched to two months, and Jessica ended the film with an impressive first credit. Two national TV commercials for Nintendo and J.C. Penney quickly followed before Jessica was featured in several independent films. She branched out into TV in 1994 with a recurring role in Nickelodeon's popular comedy series The Secret World of Alex Mack (1994). She played an insufferable young snob, devoted to making life miserable for the the title character, played by Larisa Oleynik. That same year, she won the role of "Maya" in Flipper (1995) and filmed the pilot for the series. She spent 1995 shooting the first season's episodes in Australia. An avid swimmer and PADI-certified scuba diver, Jessica was delighted to be doing a show that allowed her to play with dolphins. The show's success guaranteed it a second season, which she also starred in. Her involvement in the show lasted from 1995 to 1997. Since the show ended, she has appeared in a number of TV shows and films. In 1996, she appeared in Venus Rising (1995) as "Young Eve". The next year, she appeared on the The Dini Petty Show (1989), a Canadian talk show, and spoke about her role in Flipper (1995) and her general acting career. She began working on P.U.N.K.S. (1999), featuring Randy Quaid, in 1998. In early 1998, she appeared in Brooklyn South (1997) as "Melissa". That same year, she was in two episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990) as "Leanne" and in two episodes of Love Boat: The Next Wave (1998). She appeared in "Teen Magazine" in 1995 and various European magazines in the following several years. More importantly, she was featured in the February 1999 issue of "Vanity Fair" magazine. She also had major roles in two movies that year: Never Been Kissed (1999) and Idle Hands (1999). In 2000, she had roles in Paranoid (2000) and starred in the sci-fi TV series Dark Angel (2000).

In 2005, she starred opposite Bruce Willis and an all-star cast in the provocative and critically acclaimed "Sin City," directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller. She next starred as Sue Storm 'The Invisible Girl' in Marvel's action-franchise blockbuster "Fantastic Four," which was released by 20th Century Fox in July 2005 and became a worldwide box-office success with over $300 million in revenue.Jessica was part of Garry Marshall's all-star ensemble romantic comedy, "Valentine's Day," which broke box office records with the largest opening on a four-day President's Day weekend in history. She starred opposite Casey Affleck and Kate Hudson in director Michael Winterbottom's controversial screen adaptation of Jim Thompson's "The Killer Inside Me," as well as Robert Rodriquez's "Machete." She co-starred in the third installment of the hit "Meet the Parents" franchise "Little Fockers," as well as the 4D family adventure "Spy Kids: All the Time in the World," marking her third of five collaborations with Robert Rodriguez.Jessica was part of an all-star voice cast for The Weinstein Company's 2013 hit animated adventure, "Escape From Planet Earth," also featuring Sarah Jessica Parker, Brendan Fraser and James Gandolfini. She was last seen this past Fall in the comedy "A.C.O.D," which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and stars Adam Scott, Jane Lynch and Amy Poehler. She makes a cameo appearance in "Machete Kills," and co-stars in Robert Rodriquez's highly-anticipated, star-studded sequel "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For," which will debut in Summer 2014.Jessica has a full slate of acting projects on the horizon, including the period drama "Dear Eleanor"; "The Englishman," opposite Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek; the IFC parody mini-series "The Spoils of Babylon," produced by Funny or Die, with a stellar cast, including Will Ferrell, Kristen Wiig, Tobey Maguire, Michael Sheen and Tim Robbins; and "Stretch" co-starring Patrick Wilson, Chris Pine, Ray Liotta, Ed Helms and Brooklyn Decker.Jessica has also received Golden Globe and People's Choice Award nominations, was voted TV Guide readers' Breakout Star of the Year, and won Favorite TV Actress at the 2001 Teen Choice Awards for "Dark Angel."

      Jessica Alba is a close friend with Italian actor Andrea Logiudice. They met during the Venice Film Festival in 2002.
Taryn Dakha Malco has served as her body double for numerous films, including Fantastic Four (2005), Good Luck Chuck (2007), The Eye (2008), The Love Guru (2008) and Machete (2010).
      (May 19, 2008) Married her boyfriend of 3 years Cash Warren following a 5-month-long engagement.
      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 27, a daughter Honor Marie Warren on June 7, 2008. Child's father is her husband, Cash Warren.

      I'm really good at being sarcastic with guys. That's the best way to hang out with them, because that's what guys like. They don't want the quiet, prissy little things.
      [July 2004] I just don't have a great feeling about what we're doing in Iraq. I don't know why we're there. Didn't we just give the power back over there? Why are we still there?
      [on racial stereotyping] My father is Mexican and very dark; my mother is very fair. I used to always get [script] breakdowns for things like Maria, the janitor's daughter who hangs around with white kids. I was born in the United States. I never thought about it until the industry made me think about being a Latin girl. It seemed like such a bizarre thing.
      Men are much bigger divas than women. When I used to do the action scenes in Dark Angel (2000) I would have to play it rough. If you hit an actress accidentally, she would usually take it on the chin and say, "Don't do that again." But with the guys, they would put ice on it, take a 20-minute break and ask for X-rays. It was unbelievable. I would tell them, "Come on, man, get over it." That's actors for you.
      There is always an unspoken problem about casting Latina actresses. I have heard Jennifer Lopez talk about how it was for her, always being up for the role of the Latina chick.
      What happens when the looks fade?. If I don't establish myself as someone who can act a part rather than look the part, I will soon be finished.
      I love listening to Coldplay. But sometimes I listen to it too much and it depresses me. I call it a "reflective" mood.
      The most important thing I have learned in life was that being a teenager wasn't forever. I had a hard time being a teenager.
      I don't hang out with the Hollywood cool people. I'm not out trying to make friends with people because they're famous.
      I have my own spiritual thing, but am not part of an organized religion. I think religion is very special and individual to each person.
      I don't need to be in the press or seen. Just because I'm not in magazines or because I'm not in a movie doesn't mean I'm going away. It just means I have some sense of integrity.
      Living in L.A., everyone likes to mold you and change you. I don't care about fame, I don't care about being a celebrity. I know that's part of the job, but I don't feed into anyone's idea of who I should be.
      I used to come to Beverly Hills for auditions as a kid and think, "Why don't I live here? Why don't I drive that car?"
      I wasn't given a whole lot in my life. I was on the bottom of the class system. But I got wisdom. I never just did what people told me. I questioned everything. When I look back, it is really no surprise that I started working at 12.
      From a very early age, I remember thinking that adults were always acting like assholes. I couldn't understand why I had to respect them. My pre-school teacher forced me to write right-handed when I was left-handed. I didn't get why I had to change. Nobody could give me a reason. I have had a big problem with authority ever since.
      [Being raised by young parents] We all grew up together. My parents were so young. My dad hates it when I talk about our past, about not having things, living with grandma, wearing thrift-store clothes, cutting coupons.
      [on learning Spanish] I have a great accent because I grew up hearing it in the neighborhood. But I have no idea what I'm saying.
      [on growing up in L.A.] I never really belonged anywhere. I wasn't white. I was shunned by the Latin community for not being Latin enough. My grandfather was the only one in our family to go to college. He made a choice not to speak Spanish in the house. He didn't want his kids to be different.
      It's not always so great to be objectified but I don't feel I have much of a choice right now. I'm young in my career. I know I have to strike when the iron is hot. I look forward to the day when I can do a small movie and act and it's not about me wearing a bathing suit or chaps.
      One of the reasons why I chose not to be a devout Christian is because a lot of people gave me a lot of grief for just being a woman and made me feel ashamed for having a body because it tempted men. I didn't understand what that meant because I was like, "God created this . . ." That was a hard time in my life.
      I just didn't like the damsel-in-distress thing. I could relate to young girls wanting to see her take care of herself. And because I'm so good at action, I talked the writer and producer and director into throwing together a little fight sequence. It ended up taking three more weeks to shoot it. But at least I'm not tied up and asleep until my knight in shining armor comes and saves me. So I thought it was cool.
      My whole life, when I was growing up, not one race has ever accepted me. So I never felt connected or attached to any race specifically. I did grow up in a Mexican-American culture, but my mom [who's of French and Danish descent] was there the whole time. I mean, I had a very American upbringing, I feel American, and I don't speak Spanish. So, to say that I'm a Latin actress, OK, but it's not fitting; it would be insincere. If you're going to look genetically, I'm actually less Latin than Cameron Diaz, whose father is from Cuba. But she's not getting called a Latin actress because she's got blond hair and blue eyes.
      The movies that I do are usually physically demanding in one way or another. It's a good way to keep your health on track. Especially when you've been on-set for 14 hours, it's nice to relieve that stress in another way than having to rely on a big meal and wine.
      My first kiss was when I was 7, and it was scandalous because he was 10! I only did it so he would pick me on our neighborhood baseball team. And at the time, I thought it was great, but then it sucked because he didn't even pick me!
      Men's magazines have nipples so why don't women have a magazine where men show their penises? There's Playgirl but not a fashion magazine like Elle. If there was a magazine like that I'd buy it. Nudity's not a big deal to me . . . I've said I won't go naked in any of my movies, because I don't want to. But that doesn't mean I don't want to see other people strip off!
      It's porn [Good Luck Chuck (2007)]. There were all these actresses who got conned into being completely naked. Some were strippers, probably. But every day when I was done, I ran away. I was like, "Bye". As long as they didn't disrespect me, I could give a rat's butt.
      It's probably the most influential thing that I've ever had. Thank god for Dark Angel (2000). Getting a blessing by James Cameron to star in his first television show. Really, the first thing he did after Titanic (1997) was hire me.
      My theory is that if you look confident, you can pull off anything - even if you have no clue what you're doing.
      When I went blonde for Sin City (2005) three years ago, I swear I've never had more male attention. I'd go to a bar and all these Arab Princes and much older men would want to buy me a drink - I'm talking guys in their 80s!
      There's this mentality that you need the big dress and the big day - the day every girl gets to be a princess. I didn't agree with any of that. This tradition of obeying your husband like he's your king? It's a load of crap. Love and honor, yes. But you should love and honor yourself too, and all your friends.
      No, I'll never do a nude scene. I can act sexy and wear sexy clothes but I can't go naked. I come from a very Catholic family so it wasn't seen as a good thing to flaunt yourself like that. I can handle being sexy with clothes on but not with them off.
      [on James Cameron] There's nobody like him, and we're all blessed to have him be one of the best directors in our lifetime.
Avatar (2009) is incredible, just incredible. I love what Jim [James Cameron] is doing for the environment, just in what his movie says about taking care of and trying to save our planet. It's such a beautiful message.
      I'm a total nerd at heart. If I'm not working I spend the whole day in my pajamas. I've never been desperate to be out there at parties, or to be playing the dating game.
      Pregnancy was the most incredible experience I've ever had. So I'll take the stretch marks. I'll take the sagging boobs. I'll take the cellulite I can never get rid of.
      My mom grew up around a huge family, and they always wanted more kids, and I was like, 'Why don't you just adopt?' I'm totally inspired. If you have the love, and the capacity to love children, you should just adopt. And I plan on doing it.
      I love Kate Winslet, she has a beautiful body, as does Monica Bellucci, Beyoncé Knowles, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Biel, Scarlett Johansson. There are so many gorgeous girls out there.
      I've bought 70 percent of my house off Craigslist! I've found so many things: couches, tables, lamps. I love the idea of recycling furniture and there being a history there.
      [on her daughter] I'm very strict with her. When it's time for her to eat, whether she's hollering or whatever, it's time to eat. She gets a time out if she cries for no reason. So then she stops because she doesn't want a time out.
      [on having more children] Yeah, I think so, it's the best thing ever. So, having more kids, I can wrap my head around it.
      [on Lindsay Lohan] The fact that she can poke fun at herself - she's a brilliant actress. Mean Girls (2004) is a classic. It's so good. How can you ever forget that? I think people should probably focus more on someone's career and maybe less on someone's personal circumstances. It's nobody's business. Everyone goes through their own thing.
      [on herself after childbirth] My breasts are saggy, I've got cellulite, my hips are bigger... every actress out there is more beautiful than me.
      [on the criticism she received on her acting career] I know I haven't been swimming in the deep end with some of the movies I've done. I wasn't trying to. I knew what they were.
      When I read the script for Machete (2010), I was uncomfortable with the sexual content. I got really nervous even talking about it.
      Honor is so beautiful and I feel so enriched by being part of her life. She's my main priority now and I want to give her the best life possible. Before she was born I was totally focused on my career, but now with Cash and our daughter I feel that I'm building a wonderful family. I would like to have more children at some point.
      We didn't plan on starting a family so soon but when it happened we realized what a beautiful moment it was. We're a lot closer. The beauty of marriage and having a family is knowing you're sharing everything with someone else and are committed to being part of each others lives. Cash and I understand that and together with our daughter, we want to have a wonderful life.
      Oddly, I think I'm a little more wild and free since I had Honor because once she's in bed all my mom friends come over and we have dance parties at my house. It's really dorky and I probably wouldn't have done that before. But no, I don't go out. I hang out with my friends and I'm pretty chilled.
      [on being criticized by 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) director Tim Story] - [The director told me] 'It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? Cry pretty, Jessica'. He was like, 'Don't do that thing with your face. Just make it flat. We can CGI the tears in'.I'm like, 'but there's no connection to a human being'. And then it all got me thinking: 'Am I not good enough? Are my instincts and my emotions not good enough? Do people hate them so much that they don't want me to be a person? Am I not allowed to be a person in my work?' And so I just said, 'Fuck it - I don't care about this business anymore.'
      I don't do nudity. I just don't. Maybe that makes me a bad actress. Maybe I won't get hired in some things. But I have too much anxiety.
      I can't ever get down to the weight I was before I had Honor [her first child]. My body's just different. The jeans just sort of zip up differently, and things hang differently.
      (on physical attraction fading and personality being more important in relationships): The physical is so fleeting anyway. And when you're in a relationship, the physical lasts for, maximum, two years. And then you don't care how attractive you are to that person - if they drive you nuts, they drive you nuts.
      (on expecting her second child) The nursery isn't ready. It's not even close, but I'm accumulating things. In the beginning the baby stays with me in the room, so you don't need the nursery ready so soon. We're remodeling our house, so it's going to take a few months. I'm really taking my time.
      I was a child actor and it worked for me, given the circumstances I was in, but I'm lucky enough to give my daughter and my second baby a completely different life and an education that I never had the opportunity to have. When they're done with college, if they want to get into the arts, that's fine. I think you will be a better artist the more life experience you have, but I wouldn't encourage them to work in this type of environment as children.
      It's hard. On the weekends is when my husband and I make a concerted effort to just not email or text, but really spend our time with our daughter and be completely, 100 percent focused on her. During the week, it's here and there, depending on if I am busy with meetings or not. It is tough, because I do care about my career. I do have that, but she's my number one priority. If she's not doing okay, nothing matters.
      It feels like you're really officially, really truly a mom when you have two kids. [With] one kid you're a mom for sure, but two takes it to another level.
      [on chipping her front tooth while filming Good Luck Chuck (2007)] I chipped my front tooth doing a kiss with Dane Cook and he chipped his bottom tooth. We were doing this comedic Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) love scene, and we were slamming into walls and breaking things and tumbling over couches and stuff. At one point, he slammed my head into a picture frame and, while my head was smacking into the wall and breaking the picture, his teeth slammed into my teeth. Now I have a bond on my tooth and, when I take it off, I look like Jim Carrey in Dumb & Dumber (1994). I look really silly. I guess I'd be perfect for a sequel. I can definitely take the bond off of my tooth and throw people off a bit. I get to take this thing off and be somebody else for a little while. It's like a disguise.
      I don't have to be a boss; I don't have to be a wife; I don't have to be a sister. It's been liberating to be able to play someone who's a badass or promiscuous because that's the opposite of who I am. It's like a drug.
      [on her 'new approach' to acting] I've played a lot of leading-lady types; they were sweet, aspirational, not terribly complicated people. I need to make sure I had staying power, so I went after tentpole movies that were going to be big and global. I really just want to work with directors who I think are cool, and on movies that I think are fun and characters that I think are interesting, whether that's an indie or a big movie.
=======================================================
1980sA Sickly Military BratAlba's father, Mark, serves in the Air Force. Before she turns 9, Alba lives in Biloxi, Miss.; California; and Del Rio, Texas. Her father and mother, Cathy, finally settle in Southern California. Her early life is also marked by physical maladies. She suffers a collapsed lung twice, pneumonia, a burst appendix, a cyst on her tonsils and asthma. 1992Alba Acts UpAlba persuades her mother to take her to an acting competition in Beverly Hills where the grand prize is free acting classes.  She wins the grand prize and takes her first acting lessons.  An agent signs the 12-year-old nine months later. 1993AugustRight Place, Right TimeAlba lands a part in the feature film comedy Camp Nowhere. She was originally hired for two weeks, but her role turns into a two-month job when another actress drops out. Alba is picked as the replacement because her hair matches that of the original actress. She goes on to work in commercials for Nintendo and J.C. Penny and lands a recurring role on the popular Nickelodeon comedy series The Secret World of Alex Mack. 1995Heading Down UnderShe had a role in the dark Oscar-winning drama Leaving Las Vegas, but when her scenes are shelved in the film's final cut, Alba moves to Australia to star in the remake of the short-lived TV series Flipper. She enjoys herself there, telling Entertainment Weekly 10 years later, "I learned how to scuba dive, and I swam with dolphins in the middle of the ocean."1996AprilReligion & WorkBy the time Alba turns 15, her strict religious devotion begins to wane. "I did this episode of Chicago Hope playing a girl who had gonorrhea in her throat," she tells Entertainment Weekly, "and my friends from church made me feel so bad about it. Like I wasn't a good Christian. It started making me bitter toward the church."  In the next few years, Alba films the comedy P.U.N.K.S., and makes appearances in several TV shows, including Beverly Hills, 90210, The Love Boat: The Next Wave and the crime drama Brooklyn South. 1999JanuaryInto the DarkOut of 1,200 hopefuls, director James Cameron (Titanic) casts Alba as Max Guevara, the lead role on his Fox sci-fi series Dark Angel. "I was a smart-ass," Alba told Entertainment Weekly. "[The producers] liked that I had a smart mouth." To prepare for the role, Alba adopts an intense training regimen, saying later that she suffered from anorexia, starving herself and becoming obsessed with exercise, at one point even dropping to 100 lbs. "A lot of girls have eating disorders, and I did too," Alba told Glamour. "I got obsessed with it. When I went from a girl's body to a woman's body with natural fat in places, I freaked out." 2001JanuaryOn-Set RomancePublished reports begin to circulate that Alba, 19, is dating her Dark Angel costar Michael Weatherly, 32.  That May, Alba becomes engaged to Weatherly. "People always have to make it sound so titillating," Weatherly says to TV Guide of the couple's age gap. "It's like people think my interest in Jessica could only be of a sexual nature, that it couldn't be emotional or intellectual. I find that really childish and mean-spirited." In August 2003, the pair splits. No reason is given, but the two remain friendly. 2003November 24Sweet as 'Honey'After taking the No. 1 spot on Maxim's Hot 100 list, Alba shows off her sexy side in her first big-screen star vehicle, Honey, playing a hip-hop choreographer who teaches inner-city kids to dance. "I never danced a day in my life," Alba says. "But I figured if I could train to fight in Dark Angel, I could train to dance." December 31Boogie NightsA newly-single Alba dates Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia, whom she met in Las Vegas in early October. The two go out a few times, but by New Year's Eve the actress is spotted getting cozy with actor Mark Wahlberg in Miami Beach. "They were looking into each other's eyes," one onlooker tells PEOPLE, but the romance doesn't last.  2004SpringStrip TeaseAlba lands the role of a stripper in the Robert Rodriguez film Sin City. To research the part, Alba visits strip clubs in L.A., New York and Texas. She also learns to twirl a rope for the role. "I just spent every night in Texas in the Four Seasons [hotel] in my underwear, knocking over lamps trying to lasso things," Alba says in Interview. In the film, Alba strips only to a bikini, adhering to her no-nudity clause.

Birth Name: Jessica Marie AlbaBirth Place: Pomona, California, United StatesDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 04/28/1981, TaurusProfession: Actor
Although often noted for her sex appeal, she started out as an innocent-looking teen actress in numerous TV guest appearances as well as a regular role as a dolphin's best friend on the small-screen series Flipper. Alba segued to the big screen while still a minor, with supporting parts in Never Been Kissed and Idle Hands, both in 1999. The next year she became an instant star as a genetically enhanced messenger in the cult sci-fi series Dark Angel. While the show only lasted two seasons, it was long enough for her to become a men's-magazine favorite and get engaged to costar Michael Weatherly. In 2003 Alba made the lackluster dance movie Honey and ended her relationship. But she reemerged triumphantly in 2005 with a new beau, Cash Warren, and two leads in blockbuster features, Sin City and Fantastic Four. She married Warren in 2008, and gave birth to a daughter, Honor Marie. Active in politics (supporting Barack Obama's 2008 election) and charity (including Habitat for Humanity), she became involved in a bizarre controversy while filming in Oklahoma City in 2009. There, she pasted up posters of sharks to publicize her support of endangered species, and there was speculation she would face vandalism charges (interest in prosecution failed to materialize). She apologized, donated money to the United Way (as her "statement"---in an area not known for sharks---blocked one of their billboards) and all was forgiven.Jessica Alba Fast Facts:
Moved frequently in the first nine years of her life due to her father's military career. Lived in Mississippi, Texas and California. 
Won TV GUIDE's Breakout Star of the Year award in 2000 for her turn as a genetically engineered teen fatale in James Cameron's sci-fi series Dark Angel. 
Moved on to the horror genre in 2008's The Eye, earning both praise (a Teen Choice award) and criticism (a Razzie nomination) for her performance.  
Founded the Honest Company, which sells organic baby items.Jessica Alba Relationships: Joshua Alba - BrotherCash Warren - HusbandMichael Weatherly - Ex-fiancéCathy Alba - MotherJames Knight Newman - GodchildHaven Garner Warren - DaughterHonor Marie Warren - DaughterMark Alba - FatherJessica Alba Awards: 2001 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama - Nominee

=======================================================
Born in Pomona, California, Jessica Alba fell in love with acting at a very early age and began studying with Los Angeles acting coaches when she was just twelve. Soon after, she landed her first supporting role in the feature film Camp Nowhere (1994). Playing the recurring character Jessica in Nickelodeon's The Secret World of Alex Mack was followed by a small part in the award-winning film Leaving Las Vegas (1995) starring Nicolas Cage, but her scene ended up on the cutting room floor. Alba bounced back with a regular role on the Australian-filmed TV series Flipper, which she was thrilled about because it gave her a chance to swim and scuba dive, two of her favorite activities. 
But it wasn't until her starring role on the popular TV series Dark Angel, produced by James Cameron of Titanic fame, that Jessica began to make waves in Hollywood, earning a Golden Globe nomination. Since then, she's been listed on Maxim's Hot 100 Babe List several times and has graced the covers of Entertainment Weekly, TV Guide, Glamour and Seventeen. She's also a L'Oreal girl, with a worldwide endorsement contract. 
Alba has also appeared in the TV movie Too Soon for Jeff (1996) and was a guest on Beverly Hills, 90210, Chicago Hope and Boston South, as well as playing supporting roles in feature films such as P.U.N.K.S. (1999), Never Been Kissed (1999), Idle Hands (1999) and Paranoid (2000). When Dark Angel was cancelled after two successful seasons, Alba landed her first starring role in a major studio film with Honey (2003). Playing a dancer/choreographer, Alba, who had no previous dance training, took aerobics and exercise classes in addition to serious dance training for months before shooting to get fully prepared. 
She had to train once again, this time to be a stripper, for Sin City (2005), which featured an all-star cast. Her biggest movie hit to date has been playing Sue Storm in Fantastic Four (2005), which grossed over $150 million at the domestic box office, and the sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007). She also plays a role in the comedy Little Fockers (2010). She most recently starred in Machete Kills(2013).
Once engaged to her Dark Angel co-star Michael Weatherly, she broke it off in 2003. Jessica gave birth to a baby girl in June, 2008. It was the first child for her and husband Cash Warren. Besides swimming, she also enjoys golf.
