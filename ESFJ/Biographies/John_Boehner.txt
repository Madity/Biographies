John Andrew Boehner (/ˈbeɪnər/ [a]; born November 17, 1949) is the 61st and current Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.[2] A member of the Republican Party, he is the U.S. Representative from Ohio's 8th congressional district, serving since 1991. The district includes several rural and suburban areas near Cincinnati and Dayton.
Boehner previously served as the House Minority Leader from 2007 until 2011, and House Majority Leader from 2006 until 2007. As Speaker of the House, Boehner is second in line to the presidency of the United States following the Vice President in accordance with the Presidential Succession Act.
Boehner was born in Reading, Ohio, the son of Mary Anne (née Hall) and Earl Henry Boehner, the second of twelve children. His father was of German descent and his mother had German and Irish ancestry.[3][4][5][6][7] He grew up in modest circumstances, having shared one bathroom with his eleven siblings in a two-bedroom house in Cincinnati. His parents slept on a pull-out couch.[8] He started working at his family's bar at age 8, a business founded by their grandfather Andy Boehner in 1938.[8] He has lived in Southwest Ohio his entire life. All but two of his siblings still live within a few miles of each other; two are unemployed and most of the others have blue-collar jobs.[9][10]
Boehner attended Cincinnati's Moeller High School and was a linebacker on the school's football team, where he was coached by future Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] Graduating from Moeller in 1968, when U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was at its peak, Boehner enlisted in the United States Navy but was honorably discharged after eight weeks because of a bad back.[18] He earned his B.A. in business administration from Xavier University in 1977, becoming the first person in his family to attend college, taking seven years as he held several jobs to pay for his education.[8]
Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the packaging and plastics industry. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.[5]
From 1982 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of Union Township, Butler County, Ohio. He then served as an Ohio state representative from 1985 to 1990.[citation needed]
In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent congressman Buz Lukens, who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor. He trounced Lukens in the primary, taking 49 percent of the vote. This was tantamount to election in the heavily Republican 8th District. He has been reelected 10 times with no substantial opposition, and even ran unopposed in 1994 and 2012.
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the Gang of Seven which was involved in bringing media attention to the House banking scandal.[19]
Boehner, along with Newt Gingrich and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the Contract with America in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as House Republican Conference Chairman which is the party caucus for Republicans in the United States House of Representatives. In this post, he was the fourth-ranking House Republican, behind Gingrich, Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the Freedom to Farm Act that, among other provisions, revises and simplifies direct payment programs for crops and eliminates milk price supports through direct government purchases.
In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw Speaker Newt Gingrich's public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.[20]
On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.[21]
In 1998, Boehner was ousted as the chairman of the House Republican Conference, after his party lost five congressional seats.[22]

Following the election of President George W. Bush, Boehner was elected as chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the Pension Protection Act and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.[23]
Boehner and Senator Ted Kennedy authored the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which was signed by President George W. Bush in 2002.[24] Boehner said that it was his “proudest achievement” in two decades of public service.[25] Boehner was friends with Kennedy, also a Roman Catholic, and every year they chaired fundraisers for cash-strapped Catholic schools.[26]
In an upset, Boehner was elected by his colleagues to serve as House Majority Leader on February 2, 2006. The election followed Tom DeLay's resignation from the post after being indicted on criminal charges. Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called "earmark" process and rein in government spending. He defeated Majority Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri and Representative John Shadegg of Arizona, even though he was considered an underdog candidate to Blunt. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as Majority Whip, the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,[27] due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño of Puerto Rico to vote or not).[28]
After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader. While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi. While the Speaker is nominally elected by the full House, in practice he or she is almost always chosen by the majority party.
According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sander M. Levin, Dean of the House John Dingell, and Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey, all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.[29] As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ex officio member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about "economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing the American Dream".[26] November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker,[30][31] all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011. He received the gavel from outgoing Speaker Pelosi on Wednesday, January 5, 2011.[32] He is the first Speaker from Ohio since fellow Republicans Nicholas Longworth (1925 to 1931) and J. Warren Keifer (1881 to 1883). He is also the first Speaker who has served both as majority and minority floor leader for his party since Texas Democrat Sam Rayburn.[citation needed]
As Speaker, he is still the leader of the House Republicans. However, by tradition, he normally does not take part in debate, although he has the right to do so, and almost never votes from the floor.[33] He is not a member of any House committees.
Boehner was narrowly re-elected as Speaker of the House on January 3, 2013 at the beginning of the 113th United States Congress.[34] He received 220 votes, needing 214 to win.[35]
Boehner appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on January 23, 2014. When asked by Leno if he would ever run for president, the Speaker said no, adding, "I like to play golf. I like to cut my own grass. I do drink red wine, I smoke cigarettes. And I'm not giving that up to be President of the United States."[36]
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.[37] In a 1996 documentary by PBS called The People and the Power Game, Boehner said "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."[38] Boehner eventually led the effort to change House rules and prohibit campaign contributions from being distributed on the House floor.[39]
A September 2010 New York Times story said Boehner was "Tightly Bound to Lobbyists" and "He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation’s biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.".[40]
In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery after he learned that it featured a video by David Wojnarowicz, A Fire in My Belly, that contained an image of a crucifix with ants crawling on it. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, "Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves [in]."[41]
On January 1, 2013, after passing the fiscal cliff deal, Boehner adjourned the house without passing the $60 million Hurricane Sandy relief bill. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie harshly criticized Boehner.[42] Boehner later promised to pass the bill.[43] However, some commentators praised Boehner for not passing a bill they saw as full of pork barrel.[44]
A profile in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said, "On both sides of the aisle, Boehner earns praise for candor and an ability to listen."[45] The Plain Dealer says Boehner "has perfected the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable."[46]
Boehner has been classified as a "hard-core conservative" by OnTheIssues.[47] Although Boehner does have a conservative voting record, when he was running for House leadership, religious conservatives in the GOP expressed that they were not satisfied with his positions. According to the Washington Post: "From illegal immigration to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives – examining his voting record – see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs."[48]
Boehner voted for a Federal Marriage Amendment. In a letter to the Rights Campaign, Boehner stated, "I oppose any legislation that would provide special rights for homosexuals... Please be assured that I will continue to work to protect the idea of the traditional family as one of the fundamental tenets of western civilization."[49][50]
On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his "Democrat friends" such as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Boehner said regarding national security that voters "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-9/11 world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in Iraq."
On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.[52]
On October 3, 2008 Boehner voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP),[53] believing that the enumerated powers grant Congress the authority to "purchase assets and equity from financial institutions in order to strengthen its financial sector."
Speaker Boehner meets with President Obama at the White House during the 2011 debt ceiling increase negotiations
Boehner has been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President Barack Obama, including the "cap and trade" plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying "one dime" to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan.[54] He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan[55] and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI).[56] He has advocated for an across-the-board spending freeze, including entitlement programs. Boehner favors making changes in Social Security, such as by raising the retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, as well as tying cost-of-living increases to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation, and limiting payments to those who need them.[54]
In 2011 Boehner called the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act “one of our highest legislative priorities.”[57][58]
In 2013 Boehner led his caucus in a strategy to hold Defense spending hostage in order to avoid reducing the deficit with revenue increases.[59]
In the November 2006 election, Boehner defeated the Democratic Party candidate, U.S. Air Force veteran Mort Meier, 64% to 36%.[60]
Boehner was opposed by Democratic nominee Justin Coussoule, Constitution Party nominee Jim Condit, and Libertarian nominee David Harlow; but won the 2010 election.[62]
As Republican House Leader, Boehner is a Democratic target for criticism of Republican views and political positions. In July 2010, President Barack Obama began singling out Boehner for criticism during his speeches.[63] In one speech, Obama mentioned Boehner's name nine times[64] and accused him of believing that police, firefighters, and teachers were jobs "not worth saving."[65]
The top 10 contributors (not including political parties or other candidates) to John Boehner's campaign for the period of Jan 1, 2011 - Dec 31, 2012 represent a variety of interests.[72]
Boehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and live in the Wetherington section of West Chester Township. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.[73]

John A. Boehner (bay-ner) serves as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Elected to represent the Eighth Congressional District of Ohio for a 12th term in November 2012, John is a national leader in the drive for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable federal government.
The second oldest of 12 brothers and sisters, John has lived in southwest Ohio his entire life. He grew up mopping floors and waiting tables at his family tavern, Andy’s Cafe, and played football for legendary coach Gerry Faust at Cincinnati’s Moeller High School where he graduated in 1968.
After high school, John worked several jobs to pay his way through Xavier University. While working as a night janitor he met Debbie – now his wife of 40 years – and in 1977 earned his bachelor’s degree in business. John and Debbie raised two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia, in the northern Cincinnati suburb of West Chester where they still live today.
John went on to run a small business in the plastics and packaging industry. His experience in the private sector – meeting a payroll, paying taxes, dealing with government red tape – prepared him well to be a reformer in the public sector.
John’s first run for public office was for a spot on his neighborhood homeowners association, followed by a seat on his township board of trustees. He was elected to the Ohio General Assembly in 1984 where he served until the voters of southwest Ohio sent him to Congress.
Elected to Congress in 1990, John quickly became a voice for reform. First, he adopted a “no earmarks” policy that he carries with him to this day. And as part of the “Gang of Seven,” he and fellow lawmakers took on the House establishment – Democrats and Republicans. Together, they successfully closed the scandal-riddled House Bank, uncovered “dine-and-dash” practices at the House Restaurant, and exposed drug sales and cozy cash-for-stamps deals at the House Post Office.
In 1994, John was instrumental in crafting the landmark Contract with America. One of the Contract’s cornerstones – the Congressional Accountability Act, which required lawmakers to live under the same rules and regulations as the rest of the nation – bears the unmistakable print of his drive to change the way Congress works.
After Republicans won their first Congressional majority in several decades, John’s colleagues elected him to serve as House GOP Conference Chairman in the 104th and 105th Congress. In that role, John was a powerful voice in the fight to force Washington to stick to the strict spending limits in the Balanced Budget Act that let the economy grow and led to the first budget surplus in a generation.
As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, John authored the Freedom to Farm Act, legislation reforming the Soviet-style farm subsidy programs that punish farmers and taxpayers alike. And in 1999, as Vice-Chairman of the House Administration Committee, John joined House leaders to announce the first-ever “clean” independent audit of the House, a reform he first called for as a member of the Gang of Seven in 1992.
From 2001 to 2006, John served as chairman of the House Committee on Education & the Workforce. There he co-wrote the bill establishing the first private school choice program in the District of Columbia, and worked with other reformers to ensure parental choice provisions were included in the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act to reinforce its goal of bringing greater accountability to taxpayer-funded education programs.
Boehner’s reputation as a serious legislator focused on real solutions continued with enactment of the Pension Protection Act – the most sweeping reform of America’s pension laws in more than 30 years – which helped to ensure workers can count on their benefits when they retire.
In 2006, John was elected by his colleagues to serve as House Majority Leader. On his watch, the House passed the first budget that held the line on spending in several years and adopted the first-ever reforms making the earmark process open and accountable. In 2007, John began his tenure as House Republican Leader. In that role, he united Republicans against job-destroying bills like ObamaCare and the Democrats’ “cap and trade” national energy tax that were passed over the objections of the American people. And he helped ensure that our troops in harm’s way continued to receive the funding and resources they needed to succeed.
Under John’s leadership, Republicans launched several efforts to develop better, principled solutions to the challenges facing families and small businesses. Among them: the GOP State Solutions project, an initiative aimed at bringing reform-minded Republicans at the state and federal levels together to promote common-sense solutions from outside the Beltway. Also: the innovative America Speaking Out project which gave Americans a platform to discuss and share their priorities with national leaders – a platform that led to the Pledge to America, Republicans’ new governing agenda for the country.
On November 17, 2010 – his 61st birthday – Boehner was elected by his colleagues to serve as Speaker-designate, and on January 5, 2011 he swore in the 112th Congress as the 53rd Speaker of the House. John was re-elected by the House on January 3, 2013 to serve a second term as Speaker for the 113th Congress.
Under his leadership, the House majority has worked to make the legislative process more open and to ensure the priorities of the American people are reflected in the priorities of lawmakers. John led the drive for an aggressive set of reforms that require bills to be posted online at least three days before a vote, make it easier to cut spending, require legislation to cite its authority in the Constitution, and more.
John also led House Republicans in adopting the first ban on “earmarks” — the secretive, pork-barrel spending he has opposed since his first days in Congress. Today, Speaker Boehner is focused on removing government barriers to private-sector job creation and economic growth, cutting government spending, reforming Congress, and rebuilding the bonds of trust between the American people and their representatives in Washington.

John Boehner has been the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives since 2011, making him second in line for the presidency, behind the vice president. Look back at his career in politics so far.
Boehner, R-Ohio, holds a copy of the Constitution on Capitol Hill in Washington on May 7, 1992, as Sen. Don Nickles, D-Oklahoma, looks on. Both men proclaimed it was a historic day when the Michigan House ratified the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which would require that any Congressional pay raises not go into effect until after the next election. 
Boehner at a Capitol Hill news conference on February 6, 1995. He has had a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1990. Before that he was a member of the Ohio State House of Representatives for six years.
Boehner dumps out coal, which he called a Christmas gift to President Clinton, during a news conference about the federal budget on December 21, 1995. Many government services and agencies were closed at the end of 1995 and beginning of 1996 as a Republican-led Congress battled Clinton over spending levels.

President George W. Bush signs into law the federal education bill No Child Left Behind at a high school in Hamilton, Ohio, in 2002. The law offered the promise of improved schools for the nation's poor and minority children and better-prepared students in a competitive world. Boehner, second from right, backed the bill.

Boehner speaks to the media after a meeting with President Obama at the White House on October 2, the second day of the federal government's recent shutdown. The White House squared off with Republican rivals in Congress over how to fund federal agencies, many of which were forced to close, leaving a fragile economy at risk. 
Reporters question Boehner as he arrives at the U.S. Capitol as the government stalemate continued on October 7. President Obama signed a bill on October 17 that ended the 16-day shutdown and raised the debt ceiling.
Boehner blasts conservative groups during a press conference on December 12 after passing a compromise budget deal aimed at removing the threat of another government shutdown. Fed up with criticism from conservative advocates, Boehner said they were "misleading their followers." He followed up with: "Frankly, I just think that they've lost all credibility."
(CNN) -- Here is a look at the life of John Boehner, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives since 2011.
One of 12 children, he worked his way through college as a janitor. He met his wife Debbie during this time.
Speaker of the House is the third highest elected office in the US government. The Speaker is second in line for the presidency, behind the vice president.
1990 - Defeats Gregory Jolivette (D) with 61% of the vote for the U.S. House of Representatives seat.

John BoehnerU.S. RepresentativeBorn: 17 November 1949Birthplace: Reading, OhioBest known as: U.S. Speaker of the House, 2010-presentJohn Boehner is the longtime Congressman from Ohio who became Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.  A lifelong Ohioan, John Boehner graduated from Moeller High School in Cincinnati in 1968. He enlisted in the Navy, but was discharged after two months due to a bad back. His family was not wealthy, and Boehner worked his way hrough Xavier University, graduating in 1977. He went to work for a plastics company called Nucite Sales, rising to become its president and buying the company after the original owner died. He was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1984, and in 1990 he was elected to the U.S. Congress from Ohio's 8th District. He soon became part of the so-called Gang of Seven, a group of young GOP representatives who loudly accused Democrats of corruption, and he was also a loyal supporter of Newt Gingrich and the 1994 "Contract With America." From 1994-98 he was chairman of the House Republican Conference; he lost that job in 1998, but doggedly worked his way back to the top of the party structure. He became House minority leader in 2006, and when Republicans gained control of the House in the 2010 elections, John Boehner became Speaker of the House. (He succeeded Democrat Nancy Pelosi.) As Speaker, Boehner has proven to be an effective political operator, and he is also known for his tendency to get emotional, even teary, while giving speeches.Extra credit: John Boehner's name is pronounced "bay-ner," according to his Congressional website... John Boehner is "the second-oldest of 12 brothers and sisters," according to his official bio... He married his wife, Debbie, in 1973. They have two daughters, Tricia and Lindsay... He smokes filtered Camel cigarettes, according to a 2010 story in The New York Times... John Boehner's deep all-year tan has been a steady topic of jokes for comedians and his fellow politicians. "He is a person of color, although not a color that appears in the natural world," Barack Obama joked at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2009.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

Conservative Credentials:On every major issue, John Andrew Boehner has proven himself a fiscal and social conservative. Boehner has perfected the ability to disagree with his liberal colleagues without losing their respect. Mentored by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich after after joining Congress in 1990, Boehner ultimately helped orchestrate the "Contract with America" and the 1994 Republican Revolution, which returned the GOP to power in the House and Senate in the middle of President Bill Clinton's first term. Boehner was elected House Majority Leader in 2006 after Tom DeLay was indicted for alleged election law infractions.Early Life:Boehner was born on Nov. 17, 1949 in Cincinnati, Ohio to Earl Henry and Mary Anne (Hall) Boehner. Raised Catholic, Boehner was one of 12 children in a family of Kennedy Democrats. His father owned Andy's Café, and Boehner learned the value of hard work from early age. A lifetime resident of Southwest Ohio, he played football for the all-male Archbishop Moeller High School before graduating in 1968. He immediately enlisted in the Navy, but was honorably discharged after eight weeks because of a bad back. He enrolled in Xavier University as a business student, and was the first of his family to go to college.Early Career:While attending Xavier, Boehner met his wife, Debbie, and the two were married in 1973. While in college, he began working for Nucite Sales, a plastics and packaging company, and became an executive there after graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1977. He eventually rose through the ranks to become president of the company. Between the time he enrolled in college and the time of his graduation, Boehner made the decision to become a Republican. Five years after his graduation from college, he ran for and won a seat on the Board of Trustees of Union Township, Ohio.Rise to Political Prominance:Two years after entering public life, Boehner ran for and won a seat on the Ohio state House of Representatives, where he cultivated his conservative ideology. In 1990, he won a three-way primary race for the U.S. House, beating an incumbent convicted of statutory rape and a former U.S. Rep. by wide margins and sailed to victory over his Democratic opponent in the general election. Two scandals had rocked Congress that year -- the House Banking Scandal and the Congressional Post Office embezzlement scandal. Boehner joined six other freshmen Congressmen in condemning those House members involved in the scandals.Gang of Seven:Boehner and the other six lawmakers became known as the "Gang of Seven." Besides loudly condemning Democratic leaders for abusing the House Bank and their role in the Congressional Post Office scandal, Boehner and the others criticized many of the perks House members took, bringing attention to their free haircuts at the Congressional barbershop and free meals at the Senate restaurant, which they exposed as being part of Congress' corrupt culture. Many pundits credited the Gang of Seven for laying the groundwork for the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994. Boehner remains the only one of the seven to remain in office.The 1994 Republican Revolution:After his success with the Gang of Seven, Gingrich took Boehner under his wing, allowing the junior lawmaker to help draft the Contract with America, which provided an outline of what the GOP would do if voters returned them to power. Meanwhile, Boehner also chaired Gingrich's successful bid for minority leader. After the GOP's unprecedented victory, Boehner enjoyed an elevated standing among his fellow Republican lawmakers, and with encouragement from Gingrich, the newly minted as majority leader, Boehner became chairman of the House Republican Conference, the fourth highest position in House leadership.Tobacco Lobby Controversy:In 1995, members of his own party accused him of unethical behavior when he handed out campaign contributions from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor. Boehner apologized for the indiscretion, which was not a violation of law, then led the effort to establish a law prohibiting such behavior in the future. Boehner said his disbursement of the checks on the floor of the House was merely for convenience, but that in retrospect his actions showed poor judgment.Non-Leadership Roles:In 1998, House Republicans suffered a setback by losing a significant number of seats. Placing blame for the defeats on House leadership, other House members forced Gingrich to step down as majority leader and Boehner lost his position as conference chairman in 1999. After George W. Bush was elected president in 2000, Boehner became House Education and Workforce Committee chairman, as well as the chief architect of the president's No Child Left Behind education initiative. By 2005, Boehner had proven to be one of the most diligent conservative House members, as well as one of its most respected Republicans.Rise to House Leadership:In 2005, Majority Leader Tom DeLay was forced to resign from Congress after a grand jury indicted him on criminal charges of money laundering and violating campaign finance law. DeLay's indictment was particularly embarrassing for the Republican Party and was one of the factors that led to the Democrats return to power in the House and Senate in 2006. In response, House Republicans made sure the election for majority leader was transparent, and on Feb. 2, 2006, Boehner was chosen for the position, beating Majority Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri and Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona.Support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP):In a Jan. 15, 2009 op-ed in USA Today, Boehner expressed regret for voting for the taxpayer-funded TARP, contending that the program enacted in October 2008, which was designed to give the federal government authority to buy up toxic assets and foreclosures, had begun to "go off the rails."  Boehner voted for the program, he said, because he believed it was necessary to save the U.S. economy from financial ruin.
Republican scandals and President Bush's low approval ratings led to big losses for the GOP in 2006. Despite his conservative voting record, Boehner quickly distinguished himself as a leader who would not bow to the religious right on every issue. Although clearly a social conservative, as well as a fiscal conservative, Boehner's policy decisions were motivated by national security and limited government. After the GOP lost control of the House in late 2006, Republican leadership elected Boehner minority leader in 2007. He has embraced his role as leader of the opposition party in the House. Democrats abuses of power, and the heavy-handed methods they used to implement unpopular health care reform laws after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, helped Republicans win back control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections. Boehner, who had only served as Speaker for 11 months in 2006, was elected to a full term in the new Congress by his colleagues.
Boehner and his wife, Debbie, have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia, and live in Wetherington, Ohio.
Among both Republicans and Democrats, Boehner is known as a reformer, and he has taken the role seriously since arriving in Washington 20 years ago.
Besides his annual beach-themed Beltway party, Boehner is most famous on Capitol Hill for his perpetual tan. During a campaign speech in 2008, Democratic candidate Barack Obama joked about Boehner's George-Hamilton-style tan, calling him a "person of color." The comment raised a few eyebrows from some in the press, but most found it humorous -- including Boehner.

Born in Cincinnati in November 1949 as one of 12 brothers and sisters, Boehner has lived in Southwest Ohio his entire life. He and his wife, Debbie, have been married for 33 years. They have two daughters — Lindsay and Tricia — and live in the northern Cincinnati suburb of West Chester. After graduating from Cincinnati’s Moeller High School in 1968, John earned a bachelor’s degree in business from Xavier University in Cincinnati in 1977.
Upon his graduation, he accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the packaging and plastics industry, and eventually became president of the firm. While working in the private sector, John entered the political arena — first serving as Union Township trustee from 1982 to 1984 and then as a representative to the Ohio state legislature from 1984 to 1990. 
In 1990, he was elected to represent Ohio’s 8th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. His time in Congress has been highlighted by several government reform initiatives. His efforts include providing accountability and choice in education, ensuring workers’ pension benefits are there when they retire and fighting to rein in worthless pork barrel spending. He was instrumental in crafting the Contract with America, the bold 100-day agenda for the 104th Congress that nationalized the 1994 elections. 
Boehner is also active in education reform issues. In 1994, he passed legislation with strong bipartisan support, allowing school districts to use their Title I funds for public school choice programs, under which parents could choose which public school their children would attend.
