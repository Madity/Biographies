 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Jamie Bell was born in 1986 in Billingham, England, UK, coming from a family of dancers including his grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister. It was at his sister's dance practices that he would stand outside the door and imitate the movements of the dancers inside. At age six, he was encouraged to step inside the door and, thus, his dance career began. His own story parallels that of Billy Elliot (2000) in that Jamie kept his dancing a secret from his friends at school. His mother had him when she was 16 and, unfortunately, he never knew his father.When he met Stephen Daldry, director of Billy Elliot (2000), Jamie adopted him as his father. Once the word about his dancing got out, he was harassed, but this only made him more determined to prove that dancing wasn't just for girls. He has proven a lot by landing the title role of Billy Elliot (2000), winning the role in an audition that included more than 2,000 boys from the northeast of England. His ensuing performance certainly justified the selection since he has not only won the hearts of moviegoers all over the world, he has also been nominated for and won a number of awards, including a Best Newcomer Award and then a Best Male Performance at the BAFTA awards.
      Started dancing when he was six. Dancers have been in his family for ages. His sister, his mother, grandmother, and aunt all danced before him.
      First acting performance is reported to be part of the London stage production of Bugsy Malone in Christmas 1998.
      Was teased by classmates when they found out that Jamie took ballet, and called him "Ballerina Boy".
      When he won Best Actor at the 2001 British Academy Awards (BAFTAs), not only did he beat the Best Actor Oscar winner of that year, Russell Crowe, but the other three nominees he beat out - Tom Hanks, Michael Douglas and Geoffrey Rush - had also won the Best Actor Oscar in past years.
      Lives in Billingham with his mother Eileen and older sister Cathryn. He has no contact with his father John whom his mother divorced before Jamie was born.
      Was chosen out of 2000 boys to play "Billy Elliot" over a series of seven auditions. Criteria that the casting director was looking for were acting ability, dancing ability and the right Northern English accent.
      Only the second actor ever to be awarded Outstanding Performance by a Young Actor from the National Board of Review, USA. The first was fellow Brit Christian Bale in 1987 (then titled Outstanding Juvenile Performance) for Empire of the Sun (1987).
      Prefers tap dancing over ballet. Has been in many tap-dancing competitions and won many awards.
      He became interested in baseball when he visited the United States for the first time, and he began collecting all of the teams' jerseys.
      He was accompanied by his then girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood to the King Kong (2005) premiere in New York.
      Met his future wife, Evan Rachel Wood, while filming Green Day's music video for "Wake Me Up When September Ends", where they played an actual couple.
      Very good friends with Anne Hathaway, Romola Garai and Charlie Hunnam whom he met while filming Nicholas Nickleby (2002).
      Became a father for the 1st time at age 27 when his wife Evan Rachel Wood gave birth to their son on July 29, 2013.
      [on why he continued pursuing ballet despite the mockery] - "The other boys called me 'poof', 'ballerina boy', "Get on your tutu, Jamie." It gave me more determination to prove it wasn't just for girls. It was for boys as well."
      [on winning awards, after he won the British Academy award] "It's just an award although it is a big one. It is no good getting too big-headed. I've been very busy and I'm very tired. I've been given advice, you know on speech-making and things like that. It's kind of weird that the other guys didn't win because they're such big guys."
      (It's true that) most British movies are emotional and I agree that most American actors look manufactured. It's a shame.
      Ballet is very hard. It takes a lot of practice to get to a certain standard. You have to know a lot about the steps because when you take examinations they'll ask you all about it.
      "(Billy Elliot (2000)) got that (R-rating) because of the swearing. But it wouldn't be what it was without the swearing, kids need to swear".
      You probably won't see me dance in the movies again unless there's a 'Moulin Rouge 2' or 'Chicago Returns'.
      [assured fans he won't suffer the same fate] "I wouldn't do a Macaulay. I have sensible people around me. I see this industry as a risky business. The money thing has always been in my control. I have always had people looking after it for me. I do love buying things - stupid gadgets. I'll say, 'I want one of them.' But I do the sensible thing, knuckle down, do some good work and keep a low profile."
      (on Hollywood) "I go because that's where the work is, but I like, use and abuse. I fly in for the meetings, then fly out. That community is really small, so everybody knows each other. I kind of don't like that. It's not really a community I feel very welcome in."
      (why he picks roles based on directors) "I love looking down my résumé and seeing all those great people on it like David Gordon Green, and of course Peter Jackson and Stephen Daldry. When I look at it, I feel very proud for myself and the people around me who have managed to get me these roles."
      I think I became my own person dealing with my mother and sister. I never had a father figure so I never missed it. In fact, I thought it would be just another person to discipline me.
      I can understand why everyone sees me as Billy Elliot; it was the first thing I did, so I was determined to take the most diverse route possible. It wasn't to annoy people, but it seems to have upset so many people.
      I know people think that if you've had success young, you're going to blow it, but did you see "Batman" (The Dark Knight (2008)), did you see Christian Bale? He's so on top of his game. I've worked with a Culkin - Rory Culkin, he's a totally centered guy and he's something ridiculous, like 15. Whatever happened with Macaulay Culkin I don't know. The kid isn't messed up. Something happens to the kid to make them messed up. People are not born messed up. Things happen. People should be more sensitive.
      Inner demons? Got none of them. I had teen angst for a while, but I think every teenager has the angst.
      The young generation of actors are lazy. They don't do any work. They turn up, and say their lines. I would rather get better at what I do.
      It's fortunate that I don't have to live with being Ballet Boy any more. After this I'll be called the nipple-circling dress-wearer or Rat Boy. - On his character Hallem Foe.
      It makes no real difference because he was never there. Never having it (support from father), you don't really miss it. (My mother) raised me and my sister herself. That was incredibly difficult.
      I think it would have ruined my life. Can you imagine going back to school on Tuesday after winning an Oscar? You'd be nuts. It's unsafe in this industry for a young person. You need to be protected and to keep good people around you - On missing out an Academy Award nomination for Billy Elliot (2000).
      Learning my skill was more important than getting a big pay cheque or running away from big robots.
      I can appreciate the spotlight and pressure Heath was under. There is a feeling that, however supportive your family is, you are very much on your own in this business. I cannot pretend to know what was going on in his life. I can imagine how he felt. The film business is wonderful and I love it. But the flip side is that the expectations are very big . . . don't get ill and don't get depressed. - On Heath Ledger and the pressures of working too much.
      I have grown in confidence. And I do like to think I know the difference between confidence and arrogance.
      My biggest fear was that I would not be able to take the step from a child actor to an adult.I think it happened when I was able to play a soldier in Deathwatch (2002), set in the trenches of the first world war. The film didn't quite work out - it was a very good movie, almost - but I think that got me up and running as a grown-up actor.
      [on filming The Adventures of Tintin (2011): The Secret of the Unicorn] There were times when I didn't think I could do another take, but it does help to know your way through the pain. I am not an old man by any means, but when you are in a [motion-capture] suit and helmet, it is not the most comfortable environment.
      I like being able to hide behind the characters I play. I like to be an elusive and anonymous actor.

Bell was born in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, England,[2] where he grew up with his mother, Eileen (née Matfin), and older sister, Kathryn. His father, John Bell, a toolmaker, left before Bell was born.[3][4] Bell began his involvement with dance after he accompanied his sister to her ballet lessons.[5] He was a pupil at Northfield School and took performing arts classes at the local franchise of Stagecoach Theatre Arts. He was a member of the National Youth Music Theatre. In 1999, he was chosen from a field of over 2,000 boys for the role of Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old boy who dismays his working class widowed father and older brother by taking up ballet.[6]
Bell served as Honorary Jury President of the 2001 Giffoni Film Festival. Since his film debut in Billy Elliot, he has appeared as the disabled servant Smike in an adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby, a young soldier in Deathwatch, a teenager on the run in Undertow, a gun toting pacifist in Dear Wendy, a disaffected Southern California teenager in The Chumscrubber, and the young Jimmy in the 2005 film version of King Kong.

In 2007, he played the title character in Hallam Foe – for which he was nominated for the best actor award at the British Independent Film Awards – and appeared as himself in lonelygirl15 spin-off KateModern.[7]
In 2005, he starred opposite Evan Rachel Wood in the Green Day video Wake Me Up When September Ends, directed by Samuel Bayer. He had roles in two 2008 films: the sci-fi film Jumper and the World War II drama Defiance. In the latter he plays Asael Bielski, the third of the Bielski Brothers – leaders of a partisan group that saved some 1,200 lives during the Holocaust. Despite rumours to the contrary, he did not appear in Thea Sharrock's West End production of Equus.[8]
In 2009, it was announced Bell would play the title role in the motion capture film The Adventures of Tintin, alongside British double act Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.[9] The film received a U.S. release on 21 December 2011[10] and a U.K. release on 26 October 2011.[11] He also starred in the 2011 films The Eagle as Esca and Jane Eyre.
In 2013, he starred alongside James McAvoy in the film version of Irvine Welsh's Filth. In 2014, he has been offered the role of Ben Grimm/Thing in the 2015 reboot of Fantastic Four.[12][13]
Bell began dating American actress Evan Rachel Wood after they met while co-starring in the music video for Green Day's 2005 song "Wake Me Up When September Ends".[14] After a year together, the couple broke up in 2006.[15] Five years later, in the summer of 2011, it was reported that Bell and Wood had rekindled their relationship.[16] The couple married in a small ceremony on 30 October 2012.[17] They have one son, born in July 2013.[18] In May 2014, Bell and Wood announced that they had separated.[19]

Born in Billingham, England, Jamie Bell comes from a family of dancers, including his grandmother, mother, aunt and sister. When he was small, he would stand outside the door of his sister's dance practices and go through the dance steps along with the class. At six, he began taking lessons himself, starting with tap, after telling his mother that he could do the steps better than some of the girls in his sister's class. Although Jamie at first hid the fact that he was taking dance lessons, by the time he was eight, people found out and he was teased at school. However, he says, "It gave me more determination to prove it wasn't just for girls. It was for boys too."
When he was nine, Jamie decided to try acting as well and landed several roles over the next few years in local stage productions. In 1999, auditions were being held for the lead role a new film called Billy Elliot, the story of a boy who wants to become a ballet dancer, but meets with his family's disappointment. More than 2,000 boys tried out for the role, but Jamie landed it, and when the film came out in 2000, he became an instant star. For his performance, he won numerous awards around the world, including the Best Actor award at the 2001 British Academy Awards, beating out Russell Crowe, Tom Hanks, Michael Douglas and Geoffrey Rush. 
After Billy Elliot(2000), Jamie concentrated on schoolwork, but after finishing some important exams at age 16, he returned to the big screen in Deathwatch (2002), and followed that up with the role of Smike in the newest adaptation of Charles Dicken's classic novel, Nicholas Nickleby(2002). He won a Young Artist Award for his performance in the feature film Undertow (2004), then was chosen by director Peter Jackson to play a supporting role as young sailor Jimmy in the blockbuster King Kong (2005). Impressed with his work, Jackson again cast Bell as the title lead in his animated film The Adventures of Tintin (2011), a joint venture with iconic director Steven Spielberg. Bell also stars in the thriller Man on a Ledge (2012). Most recently, he starred in the film Nymphomaniac: Volumes I and II (2014). 
Jamie's favorite type of dancing is tap, for which he has won many awards at various competitions. However, he says he prefers being a professional actor to being a professional dancer. 
When Jamie was small, he had an interest in hockey until he was taken to see a game up close and was put off by the violence. He currently is a big baseball fan and collects major league team shirts. In his spare time Jamie likes reading, writing and playing computer games.

 A native of Billingham, England, Jamie Bell is an example of endurance and dedication paying off if there ever was one. Though the aspiring young dancer was the object of frequent teasing by school classmates (who dubbed him "Poof" and "Ballerina Boy," among other unsavory monikers), he persevered and ultimately landed the lead in the affecting 2000 drama Billy Elliot. Bell's family has a rich history in the world of dance that dates back to his grandmother. Though at first shy about his ambitions, the boy quietly imitated the moves of his older sister as she practiced in the studio; by the time he was six, others began to recognize his natural talent and encouraged him to practice, though Bell tried to keep his extracurricular activities a secret from his classmates. He later enrolled in the Stagecoach Theater School in hopes of refining his acting skills. Practice in both arenas ultimately paid off when Bell was selected from more than 2,000 young hopefuls to fill the toeshoes of the titular character in Stephen Daldry's Billy Elliot. During the production of the film, the fresh-faced actor and veteran director developed a warm, father/son-like bond that helped Bell gain the confidence he needed to fully explore his talent. An unexpected hit that was embraced by critics and audiences around the world, Billy Elliot earned many prestigious nominations and awards, including BAFTAs for Best British Film and Best Actor for its young star, who was also named Best Newcomer at The British Independent Film Awards. Though he subsequently hung up his ballet shoes in favor of more acting roles, Bell continued to impress in such features as the horror-flavored war film Deathwatch and the Charles Dickens adaptation Nicholas Nickleby (both 2002). The following year, the busy young actor took the lead in no less than three films: Dear Wendy, Undertow and Who Goes There? -- all scheduled for release in 2004.
Bell continued to work with the best directors, signing on with Peter Jackson for his remake of King Kong and playing a part for Clint Eastwood in Flags of Our Fathers. In 2008 he appeared in the World War II drama Defiance. Three years later he had an international hit of a sort when he provided the physical basis for the lead character in Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tin Tin, and appeared in the well-reviewed adaptation of Jane Eyre starring Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender. In 2012, he had a supporting role in Man on a Ledge and was featured in Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac in 2013. Bell took the lead in the AMC Revolutionary War series Turn in 2014. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
