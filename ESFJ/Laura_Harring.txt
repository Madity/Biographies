Sick most of her childhood, Laura's mother found an alternative medical doctor that helped Laura get over the illness and this transformed her life forever. Laura, who was taking adult dosages of medicine, abandoned them ambitiously to start dancing and imagine herself as an actress. On her journey to newfound health, she jumped in, feet first, to an play an angel in the Christmas play, "The Nativity Story".In her teens, Laura went abroad to study at the prestigious boarding school, Aiglon College in Switzerland. It was here that Laura met the brother of her future husband of 2 years, before having an amicable separation to pursue her dream of becoming a talented and versatile actor. After graduation, pursuing her passion to travel, Laura took on the task of becoming a social worker in India, where she performed manual labor work, including building schools, planting trees and carrying heavy rocks to fix the extreme soil erosion problem, that hit the foothills of the Himalayas in the mid eighties.Last June, Laura played the mystery in the Warner Brothers feature "Nancy Drew (2007): The Mystery in Hollywood Hills", starring alongside Emma Roberts for director Andrew Fleming and producer Jerry Weintraub.Last November, she starred opposite Javier Bardem in New Line's Love in the Time of Cholera (2007) from the award-winning novel written by Nobel Prize Winner Gabriel García Márquez and directed by Mike Newell.A versatile actress who has played a great diversity of roles in her career, Harring's film credits include John Q (2002) with Denzel Washington, The King (2005) opposite William Hurt and The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory (1987), opposite the legendary Raul Julia. Laura always held her own.Last summer, she stole our hearts with the heartfelt and real performance of a suburban mom in the HBO feature Walkout (2006), directed by Edward James Olmos. It was based on the true story of the 60's injustice in the school system of East Los Angeles.Harring was featured on Season 5 of FX¹s critically-acclaimed hit series, The Shield (2002) as "Becca Doyle", a defense attorney who willingly commits to pro bono cases for people she feels are redeemable. She played opposite Forest Whitaker.In his last film, David Lynch honored her femme fatale character from Mulholland Dr. (2001) in Inland Empire (2006), another dark and mysterious abstract film of the masterful director.Her last film opposite Frank Langella and Elliott Gould is called The Caller (2008) and Laura plays "The Sophisticated Lady", a classical jazz singer, which premieres in this year's Tribeca Film Festival.Laura was the first Latina to ever win the Miss USA crown! Her passions include dancing, world traveling and Commedia Dell' Arte. She resides in Los Angeles, California.
      Miss USA 1985. She became the first Latina to win the Miss USA title, and at only 21 years of age. She was the first of five consecutive Miss Texases who, from 1985 through 1989, went on to become Miss USA.
      She was married civilly in Los Angeles, Los Angeles Co., CA, on 12 February 1987 and religiously in Carejes, Mexico, on 27 February 1987 to Carl-Edward Otto Wolfgang Jayme Anders, Graf von Bismark-Schönhausen, and although they divorced, she still retains the title of Gräfin.
      She wore a $25,000,000 dollar necklace and $1,000,000 dollar heels to the 2002 Academy Awards, surrounded by four bodyguards.
      Was shot in the head at the age of twelve while riding in her parents car in a parking lot when the two cars behind them got into a gunfight. The bullet missed hitting her brain by one millimeter.
      Daughter of Raymond Harring and wife María Martínez and sister of Rita Harring. Her mother subsequently married Gastón Lima and had a daughter Ana María Lima.
      Unless you have a real passion for making movies, then don't bother. I had to carry energy and light into every meeting, only to be told, 'We don't want you.' I couldn't take it personally. You just have to wait, and live for those moments when the casting director likes you. Those words - 'You're hired' - are the best. I would try to remember what I learned in India - everything that happens is a mirror of how you are feeling. If you don't feel good about yourself, people don't feel good about you either. When you feel good, people see that and want to help you.
      In private, I'm a hippie who follows Buddhism, does yoga, meditates and loves to dance wildly. But when I'm on show, I become a different person. Some actors do not understand that difference, and resent it. I say, 'Let them give you the jewels, go around with your bodyguard, let them dress you. If you are promoting a film, don't be afraid of glamor.'
      It is important to know the difference between the hard work of acting and play-acting at events like this. The only difference between me and some other actresses is that I don't mind playing the game.
      Some may think fashion is frivolous, but the way I see it, when you dress well, you add beauty to the world. And there's nothing wrong with that, right?
      Life is wonderful beautiful journey. Every episode of my life is like a dream and I am at peace and happy with what life has given me.
      Extremes? The Hermetic Philosophy says that you can master yourself and find the Center. When I do I'll give you a call.

Mulholland Drive Background:  I believe the (lesbian) scenes were needed in the film to show the obsession  between the two characters, but I was terrified at first, a little watery eyed  before doing the scene. David made it very comfortable. It wasnt technical. He  just let the cameras roll. There was a lot of respect on the set. Laura Harring  on Mulholland Drive   One of Hollywoods hottest stars Laura Harring got her start as a beauty queen  before establishing a prolific career in acting. The international Herald  Tribune has contrasted her to Ava Gardner and film critics Philip Lopate and  Roger Ebert linked her to Rita Hayworth. Although very talented, the striking  brunette hasnt got the opportunity to fully develop her potential that would  make her really shine. Since making her movie debut in the forgettable Silent  Night Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out! (1989), the Mexican beauty is most  well-known for portraying amnesiac Rita in the critically-acclaimed David Lynch  film Mulholland Drive (2001), where she won an ALMA award. Her film credits  include John Q (2002), Derailed (2002), Willard (2003), Mi Casa, Su Casa (2003),  The Punisher (2004) and The King (2005).

As for her private life, ex-wife of German Count Carl Edward Von  Bismark, Herring is currently single. The professional tango dancer now resides  in Los Angeles and likes spending her off time by dancing the tango and  practicing yoga.    Miss USA  Childhood and Family:  Born Laura Elena Martinez Herring, on March 3, 1964, in Los Mochis, Sinaloa,  Mexico, Laura Harring is the middle daughter of a German descent father, Raymond  Herring, and a Mexican mother, Maria Martinez. Her parents split up when she was  7, and her mother later married Cuban-born stepfather Gaston Lima. Laura has a  younger sister named Rita Herring (born in 1967) and is a granddaughter to the  1954 Mexican Equestrian and Fencing champion Isauro Cairo.   Growing up in Mexico, 11-year-old Laura moved with her family to San Antonio,  Texas, where at age 12, she became the victim of a drive-by shooting suffering a  head wound. After her recovery, Laura attended a boarding house in Texas before  flying to Switzerland to study at one of the top schools called Aiglon College  when she was 16. Upon receiving an academic diploma, Laura began her journey  throughout Asia and Europe, and at age 18, she was a social worker in India. A  restaurant cashier in Philippine, Laura was briefly apprehended by her  love-smitten boss who had taken away her passport. She then made her way back to  America and settled down in El Paso, Texas, where she began entering the beauty  pageant circuits and finally took home the title of Miss USA in 1985.   During a second trip to Europe, Laura met and fell for a German Count, Carl  Edward von Bismarck, who was the brother of her roommate Claudia. In 1986, the  couple became engaged and got married a year later. The countess decided to end  up her marriage in 1990 after conflicting with her husband over her desire to  pursue a career in acting. She studied drama at the London Academy of Performing  Arts, specializing in the French style of Commedia dellArte.   Inland Empire  Career:  Returning to the USA after a traveling life throughout Asia and Europe,  Mexico-born Laura Harring found employment as a clothing stores sales clerk  before entering the world of beauty pageants. With her attractiveness, Harring  soon became a jury favorite and picked up the title of Miss El Paso. Shortly  after, she took home the Miss Texas crown and created a history at age 21 when  she became the first Hispanic beauty to win Miss USA title.   Spotted by an agent for her charm and good looks while crowning her successor,  Harring made her TV acting debut in 1987 with a minor role as Raul Julias wife  in NBCs film The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory, and moved to silver screen film  two years later by taking the supporting turn of Jeri in the unremarkable horror  installment Silent Night Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out!. Harring became  highly involved in showbiz after her separation with her husband in 1990. She  starred as Nisa, a Brazilian woman who introduces the Lambada to the American in  the equally corny The Forbidden Dance (1990) and had a one-year stint as Carla  Greco in the long-running daytime soap General Hospital (1990-91).   After her contract with General Hospital ended, she had small role in the  direct-to-video release Dead Women in Lingerie (1991), guest starred in  Baywatch and Blossom (both 1993), supported Kenny Rogers, Naomi Judd and  Travis Tritt in TV film Rio Diablo (1993) and was featured as M.C. Kindra, a hot  tour guide of the titular sexual haven in Garry Marshalls Exit to Eden (1994).  Next up, she costarred with Henry Darrow, Carol Mayo Jenkins and J. Downing, as  Gabriella Cochrane, in the series Empire (1995), had a three-episodic turn as  Garcia in the family drama serial Flipper (1995-96) as well as appeared as  Babette the Mayors Girl in the Joan Severance action vehicle Black Scorpion II:  Aftershock (1997). Also in 1997, Herring made a brief comeback to a daytime  series when she teamed up with the renowned Aaron Spelling for his drama Sunset  Beach, playing sexy cop Paula Stevens. Discontented with the development of her  characters storyline, Harring soon left the show to find more work.   The subsequent years saw her have guest appearances in Frasier (1998), Silk  Stalkings (1999) as well as in the sci-fi series Black Scorpion (2001), play  Marisleysis Gonzalez, an escaped mother in the Fox docudrama A Family in Crisis:  The Elian Gonzales Story (2000) and act opposite Adam Sandler in the comedy  Little Nicky (2000). However, it wasnt until her starring turn opposite Naomi  Watts in the David Lynch- award-winning Mulholland Dr. (2001) that she gained  acclaimed from both audiences and critics alike. As Rita, the mysterious  amnesiac and Watts lesbian lover, Harring offered a terrific, dreamlike and  sensual turn that brought her an ALMA for Outstanding Actress in a Motion  Picture. Aside from her breakthrough role in the Cannes-screened film, she also  had supporting parts in the action movie Final Payback and Kevin Jordans short  Feather Pimento, that same year.   Harrings film career took flight after the success. She was cast opposite  Denzel Washington in the action drama John Q (2002), costarred with Jean-Claude  Van Damme and Thomas Arana in director Bob Misiorowskis Derailed (2002), found  herself acting along side Crispin Glover and R. Lee Ermey in the rat-themed  horror remake Willard (2003) for director Glen Morgan, before headlining the  Bryan Lewis-helmed comedy Mi Casa, Su Casa (2003, with Barbara Eden of I Dream  of Jeannie fame) and costarring in the thriller The Poet (2003). After a small  part in the 2004 film Return to Babylon, opposite fellow beauty Maria Conchita  Alonso, the appealing actress offered a strong portrayal as John Travoltas  infamous spouse Livia Saint in Jonathan Hensleighs thriller The Punisher  (2004), while in 2005, she joined Marisa Ramirez, Nichole Hiltz and Laz Alonso  for Jeremy Kastens horror All Souls Day: Dia de los Muertos and portrayed  self-conscious and grief-stricken Twyla in Milo Addicas The King, along side  William Hurt and Gael Garcia Bernal.   Recently, versatile Harring returned to TV with the recurring role of Becca  Doyle in the FX critically acclaimed hit series The Shield and played  supporting role Francis Crisostomo in the HBO original hit movie Walkout, which  starred Alexa Vega. She will costar opposite John Hannah in director/writer  Lamberto Bavas thriller film Ghost Son (2006) and be featured in the Andrew  Fleming-helmed Nancy Drew, a thriller for a 2007 release. She is also set to  play a role in the David Lynch new and highly anticipated film Inland Empire.    Awards:  ALMA: Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture, Mulholland Drive, 2002

"The typical femme fatale is satisfied with just going for it. I'm too romantic. I love being in love." -Laura Harring
                Her extensive television work finally landed her onto the big screen, with roles in Little Nicky, John Q, and most notably David Lynch's Mulholland Drive.            
                Laura Harring makes us feel the same way our fathers or grandfathers surely felt when they first saw Rita Hayworth swing her hair. Harring's sexiness is one of suggestion rather than exposure. The way she stares at the camera simply whispers, "Just imagine what I can do to you, boy." And there are few things that leave a man more delightfully helpless than that.  Esquire magazine summed it up with this write-up about her: "When Harring bedded Naomi Watts in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, we forgot that the movie made no sense. Then we saw it again."            
                Though very talented, Laura Harring's work hasn't given her the chance to really shine. She started out promisingly, as the bride of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (played by the late Raul Julia) in The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory, a made-for-TV movie. After that, her only memorable roles were in the regrettably forgettable Rio Diablo, Lambada: The Forbidden Dance and Empire, the latter a fizzled TV series.  She became more prominent in Sunset Beach, an Aaron Spelling vehicle in which she played cop Paula Stevens. After a made-for-TV movie about Elian Gonzales, she went more mainstream with Little Nicky in 2000. But until now she is most remembered as Rita in Mulholland Drive. In fact, Harring was so memorable in the role that it won her an American Latino Media Arts (ALMA) Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture.   Her role as John Travolta's wife in 2004's The Punisher should only increase her profile.            
                Laura Elena Harring was born in the northern Mexican city of Los Mochis on March 3, 1964. With German and Austrian lineage, she already stood out in her native land, where she grew up for the first 10 years of her life. At age 11, she and her family moved to San Antonio, Texas. When she was 12, she was in her parents' car when two cars behind them got into a gunfight.  A stray bullet hit the car and grazed her head, missing her brain by one millimeter.   laura harring goes international Already multilingual and with an irrepressible travel bug, she convinced her family to let her go to Switzerland at age 16, where she spent her high school years attending Aiglon College. After graduation, she backpacked through Europe and Asia, going as far as India, where she spent a month as a social worker, digging ditches and planting vegetable patches.  laura harring is miss america She eventually returned to America, settling down in El Paso, Texas. With good looks and grace in spades, she decided to enter the world of beauty pageants. She won the title of Miss El Paso, and soon after, Miss Texas. In 1985, at only 21 years of age, she became the first Hispanic to ever win the Miss America crown.  Thanks to her victory, Harring got the chance to return to Europe. It was during her trip that she met Count Carl von Bismarck and married him, earning the title of countess. Though divorced, she retains the title to this day.  While in Europe, Harring studied theater at the London Academy of Performing Arts, specializing in the French style of Commedia dell'Arte.  laura harring in the alamo In 1987, she got into television, her first project a minor role in the made-for-TV movie, The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory. After another TV film the following year, she made the move to the big screen, as Jerri in the low-budget slasher flick Silent Night, Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out! (1989).  Despite being virtually unknown, the movie made enough of a splash to lead to Harring's role in the equally corny Lambada: The Forbidden Dance in 1990. For the next seven years, Laura's potential was practically wasted with minor roles in forgettable movies and TV shows, including a season of General Hospital.  Her future fans would remember her fondly as a sexy policewoman in Aaron Spelling's Sunset Beach, in 1997. But soon Harring was left to find more work that would severely undervalue her talents, such as a made-for-TV movie recounting the Elian Gonzales saga.  laura in mulholland drive  In 2000, Harring played a minor part alongside Adam Sandler in Little Nicky, and starred in another short-lived TV show, Black Scorpion. But the role she was waiting for -- the chance to display her finesse and femme fatale essence -- would come the following year, in Mulholland Drive. In the critically-acclaimed David Lynch film, she played an amnesiac named Rita and was apparently instructed by Lynch to act like a cat. The final product blew away many men, especially the lesbian love scene with Naomi Watts.  laura harring stars in the punisher  Harring's phone rang a lot more after the film's release in 2001. Her other film credits include 2002's John Q with Denzel Washington and Derailed with Jean-Claude Van Damme, as well as 2003's Willard with Crispin Glover. In 2004, she could be seen in The Punisher, a movie based on the comic book of the same name and starring John Travolta (Harring plays Travolta's wife). Harring also starred in 2004's Return to Babylon, along with fellow beauty Maria Conchita Alonso.   Laura Harring, still single, currently lives in Los Angeles. In her spare time, she dances the tango and practices yoga.

 Frequently drawing comparisons to such glamorous Hollywood starlets as Ava Gardner and Rita Hayworth, former Miss U.S.A. turned sultry screen siren Laura Elena Harring had been acting in features for over a decade when she entranced audiences with her enigmatic performance in David Lynch's surreal mystery Mulholland Dr. Born in Los Mochis, Sinaola, Mexico, Harring relocated to San Antonio, TX, with her mother and two sisters at age 11. Traveling abroad to study at Switzerland's Aiglon College at the age of 16, the worldly student later spent time doing such unglamorous work as digging ditches and planting gardens in India as a social worker. Though she would spend a brief period backpacking throughout the world following her exploits in Switzerland and India, it wasn't long before Harring returned to her family in Texas and made the fateful decision to enter the Miss El Paso contest. After becoming the first Latina to win the title of Miss U.S.A. in 1985 at the age of 21, Harring entered the world of royalty with her marriage to Count Carl Edward Von Bismark. Shortly after her marriage, Countess Harring would pursue her love of drama at the London Academy of Performing Arts. Refining her talents on the stages of Los Angeles' downtown theater arts district, the Countess made her screen debut as the bride of Santa Anna in the 1987 made-for-television film The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory. Harring alternated between television and film in the following years, later igniting the screen with her passion for tango in 1990's The Forbidden Dance. Amicably separated from her husband shortly thereafter, the emerging actress focused her career and continued to alternate between the small and silver screens with roles in Exit to Eden (1994), The Elian Gonzalez Story, and Little Nicky (both 2000) before hitting her stride under the assured direction of eccentric director Lynch the following year. Originally conceived as a television pilot, Mulholland Dr. was rejected by the networks before being retooled into a feature that fascinated audiences and critics at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it earned a Best Director award. Drawing much attention at the 2002 Oscars for her pricey footwear, the now in-demand starlet continued her Tinsel Town ascent with a role in the Denzel Washington hostage drama John Q. the following year. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
