Shania Twain, OC (/ʃəˌnaɪ.ə ˈtweɪn/; born Eilleen Regina Edwards; August 28, 1965) is a Canadian country music singer-songwriter. Referred to as "The Queen of Country Pop",[1] she is one of the most commercially successful artists of all time, having sold over 85 million albums.[2] Twain's 1995 album The Woman in Me, 1997's Come On Over, and 2002's Up! (her last studio album to date), are three of the best-selling albums of all time. Subsequently, Twain is often recognized for reaching beyond all feasible music boundaries with only three studio albums.[3]
Twain has received 5 Grammy Awards, 27 BMI Songwriter awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and an induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.[4] She is the first (and currently only) female artist in history to have 3 consecutive albums certified Diamond by the RIAA. With over 40 million copies sold worldwide, Come On Over is the best-selling album by a female artist and the top-selling country album of all time.[5] Altogether, Twain is ranked as the 10th best-selling artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era.[6]
In 2004, Twain retired from performing and quietly retreated to her home in Switzerland.[7] In her 2011 autobiography, she cited a weakening singing voice as the reason for not performing publicly.[8] When both her singing and speaking were affected, Twain consulted the Vanderbilt Dayani Center in Nashville. Specialists discovered lesions on her vocal cords and diagnosed her with dysphonia, all treatable with careful rehabilitation.[9] In 2012, Twain returned to the concert stage in her critically acclaimed show Still the One, exclusively at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.
Shania Twain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in Windsor, Ontario, the daughter of Sharon (née Morrison) and Clarence Edwards. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother then moved to Timmins, Ontario with Eilleen and her sisters Jill and Carrie Ann. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an Ojibwa, and they had a son together, Mark. Jerry adopted the girls, legally changing their last name to Twain. When Mark was still in diapers, the Twains adopted Jerry's baby nephew, Darryl, after Darryl's mother died. Because of her connection to her stepfather, in the past it has been reported that Twain's ancestry was Ojibwa,[10] however she stated in an interview that her biological father was part Cree.[11] Her ancestry also includes Irish, French-Canadian and English.[12][13] Through a maternal great-grandmother, she is a descendant of Zacharie Cloutier.[14] Her maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from Newbridge, Kildare, Ireland.
Eilleen Twain had a hard childhood in Timmins. Her parents earned little and there was often a shortage of food in the household. Eilleen did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. In the remote, rugged community, she learned to hunt and to chop wood. Sharon and Jerry's marriage was at times stormy, and from a young age, Eilleen witnessed violent fights between them. Sharon struggled with bouts of depression. In the summer of 1979, while Jerry was at work, at Eilleen's insistence, her mother drove the rest of the family 680 kilometres (420 mi) south to a Toronto homeless shelter for assistance.[15] Sharon returned to Jerry with the children in 1981. In Timmins, Twain started singing at bars at the age of eight to try to make ends meet, often earning twenty dollars between midnight and one in the morning performing for remaining customers after the bar had finished serving. Although she expressed a dislike for singing in those bars, Twain believes that this was her own kind of performing arts school on the road.[16] She has said of the ordeal, "My deepest passion was music and it helped. There were moments when I thought 'I hate this'. I hated going into bars and being with drunks. But I loved the music and so I survived".[17] Twain wrote her first songs at the age of ten, Is Love a Rose and Just Like the Storybooks which were fairy tales in rhyme.[18] She states that the art of creating, of actually writing songs, "was very different from performing them and became progressively important".[18]
At 13, Eilleen was invited to perform on CBC television's the Tommy Hunter Show. While attending Timmins High and Vocational School in Timmins, she was also the singer for a local band called "Longshot" which covered Top 40 music.[19]
In the early 1980s, Twain spent some time working with her father's reforestation business in northern Ontario, a business that employed some 75 Ojibwe and Cree workers. Although the work was demanding and the pay low, Twain said "I loved the feeling of being stranded. I'm not afraid of being in my own environment, being physical, working hard. I was very strong, I walked miles and miles every day and carried heavy loads of trees. You can't shampoo, use soap or deodorant, or makeup, nothing with any scent; you have to bathe and rinse your clothes in the lake. It was a very rugged existence, but I was very creative and I would sit alone in the forest with my dog and a guitar and would just write songs".[20]
After graduating from Timmins High in June 1983, Twain was eager to expand her musical horizons.[21] After the demise of the band Longshot, Twain was approached by a cover band led by Diane Chase called "Flirt" and they toured all over Ontario.[21] Twain also began taking singing lessons from Toronto-based coach Ian Garrett and would often clean his house in payment for her lessons.[22] In the autumn of 1984, Twain's talents were noticed by Toronto DJ Stan Campbell who wrote about her in a Country Music News article: "Eilleen possesses a powerful voice with an impressive range. She has the necessary drive, ambition and positive attitude to achieve her goals".[22] Campbell happened to be making an album by Canadian musician (and present-day CKTB radio personality) Tim Denis at the time and Twain was featured on the backing vocals of the song Heavy on the Sunshine.[23][22] Campbell later took Twain to Nashville to record some demos, which Twain found particularly difficult to finance. She became acquainted with regional country singer Mary Bailey who had had some country chart success in 1976. Bailey had seen Twain perform in Sudbury, Ontario, saying "I saw this little girl up on stage with a guitar and it absolutely blew me away. She performed Willie Nelson's "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" and Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry". Her voice reminded me of Tanya Tucker, it had strength and character, a lot of feeling. She's a star, she deserves an opportunity".[24] Bailey later said "She sang a few songs that she had written, and I thought to myself, this kid is like nineteen years old, where does she get this? This is from a person who's lived sixty years".[25]
Bailey acquired the contract from Stan Campbell and Twain moved into Bailey's home on Kenogami Lake where she practised her music every day for hours. In the fall of 1985, Bailey took Twain down to Nashville to stay with a friend, record producer Tony Migliore, who at the time was producing an album for fellow Canadian singer Kelita Haverland and Twain was featured on the backing vocals to the song Too Hot to Handle. She also demo-ed songs with Cyril Rawson but the demos were without success, partly due to Twain's wish to become a rock singer, not a country artist. After five months she returned to Canada and moved in with Bailey in a flat in downtown Kirkland Lake, not far from Kenogami.[26]
There she met rock keyboardist Eric Lambier and drummer Randy Yurko and formed a new band, moving three months later to Bowmanville, near Toronto. In late summer 1986, Mary Bailey arranged for Twain to meet John Kim Bell, a half Mohawk, half American conductor who had close contacts with the directors of the Canadian Country Music Association. Bell recognized Twain's ability as well as her looks and the two began secretly dating.[26] In the fall of 1986 Twain continued to express her desire to be a pop or rock singer rather than country, which led to her falling out with Mary Bailey for two years. Twain's first break finally came on February 8, 1987, when Bell staged a fundraiser for the National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation at the Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto where Twain performed with Broadway star Bernadette Peters, jazz guitarist Don Ross, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Her performance received little acclaim, but it convinced Bell, who hated pop music, that Twain should stay well away from it and concentrate on country music.[27]
On November 1, 1987, Twain's mother and stepfather died in a car accident approximately 50 kilometres north of Wawa, Ontario.[28] As a result Twain moved back to Timmins to take care of her younger siblings and then took them all to Huntsville, Ontario. There, she supported them by earning money performing at the nearby Deerhurst Resort.[29]
A couple of years passed and Twain's siblings got older and moved out on their own. Twain assembled a demo tape of her songs and her Huntsville manager set up a showcase for Twain to present her material to record executives. She caught the attention of a few labels, including Mercury Nashville Records, who signed her within a few months.[30] During this time, she changed her name to Shania, which was said to be an Ojibwa word which means "on my way". However, Twain's biographer, Robin Eggar, writes: "There is a continuing confusion about what 'Shania' means and if indeed it is an Ojibwe word or phrase at all. [...] There is no mispronounced or misheard phrase in either Ojibwe or Cree that comes close to meaning 'on my way.' Yet the legend of her name continues to be repeated in the media to this day and will doubtless provide the obituary headline when Shania eventually passes on."[31]
Twain's self-titled debut album was released in 1993 in North America and garnered her audiences outside Canada. Shortly before its release, she sang backing vocals for other Mercury artists, including Jeff Chance's 1992 album Walk Softly on the Bridges[32] and Sammy Kershaw's 1993 album Haunted Heart.[33] Shania Twain only reached No.67 on the US Country Albums Chart, but it gained positive reviews from critics. The album failed to sell significant copies initially, although Twain's future success generated enough interest for the album to be certified platinum six years later by the RIAA, denoting sales of over a million. The album yielded two minor hit singles in the United States with "What Made You Say That" and "Dance with the One That Brought You". The album was more successful in Europe, where Twain won Country Music Television Europe's "Rising Video Star of the Year" award.[30]
When rock producer Robert "Mutt" Lange heard Twain's original songs and singing from her debut album, he offered to produce and write songs with her. After many telephone conversations, they met at Nashville's Fan Fair in June 1993. Twain and Lange became very close within just weeks, culminating in their wedding on December 28, 1993. Lange and Twain either wrote or co-wrote the songs that would form her second studio album, The Woman in Me.[30][34] Record executives were stunned when they listened to the album. It was unlike anything else in country music.[35]
The Woman in Me was released in the spring of 1995. The album's first single, "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?" went to No.11 on the Billboard Country Chart. This was followed by her first Country Top 10 and No.1 hit single, "Any Man of Mine", which also cracked the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. Twain had further hits from the album, including the title track which peaked at No.14 and three additional No.1 hits: "(If You're Not in it for Love) I'm Outta Here!", "You Win My Love", and "No One Needs to Know", which was selected for the original soundtrack for the 1996 film Twister, a first for Twain, plus minor country hit "Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore)" and a re-recorded gospel version of the album track "God Bless The Child" with new lyrics.[30] Meanwhile in Australia, five of these singles: "Any Man of Mine", "The Woman in Me", "I'm Outta Here!", "You Win My Love" and "God Bless The Child", were remixed for the Australian pop market, and "I'm Outta Here!" became Twain's breakthrough hit there, reaching No.5 on the ARIA charts.
As of 2007, the album had sold more than 12 million copies.[36] The album was a quick breakthrough and because of this Twain performed selected international venues and television shows including two CMA Fan Fair performances with Nashville guitarists Randy Thomas (co-writer of the song "Butterfly Kisses"), Dan Schafer,[37] Chris Rodriguez, Russ Taff, Hugh McDonald bass player of Bon Jovi, Dave Malachowski and Stanley T., formerly with The Beach Boys.
Mercury Nashville's promotion of the album was based largely upon a series of music videos.[38] During this period, Twain made major television appearances on shows such as two performances on Late Show with David Letterman, Blockbuster Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and the American Music Awards. The Woman in Me won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album as well as the Academy of Country Music award for Album of the Year; the latter group also awarded Twain as Best New Female Vocalist.
In 1997, Twain released her follow-up album, Come On Over. This was the album that would establish her as a successful crossover singer. Slowly, following the release of lead singles "Love Gets Me Every Time" and "Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)", which allowed Twain to make more appearances in the Billboard Hot 100, the album started racking up sales. It never hit the top spot, but with the multi-chart hit single "You're Still the One", sales skyrocketed. Other songs like "When", "Honey, I'm Home", "You've Got A Way", "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!", "That Don't Impress Me Much" and "From This Moment On" joined the 12 songs that eventually saw release as singles. "From This Moment On" is a duet with singer Bryan White and there was a re-recorded solo pop version as well.
The album stayed on the charts for the next two years, going on to sell 40 million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling album of all time by a female musician.[39] It is also the eighth biggest-selling album by any type of artist in the US[36] and the top selling country album in history. Songs from the album won four Grammy Awards during this time, including Best Country Song and Best Female Country Performance (for "You're Still the One" and "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!") for Twain. Lange won Grammys for "You're Still the One" and "Come on Over".
Despite the album's record sales it wasn't able to top the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 2. In 1998, following the pop release of "You're Still the One", the Come on Over album was released in a remixed format for the European market as a pop album with less country instrumentation and actually gave her the big breakthrough in Europe she and her producer husband (Robert John "Mutt" Lange) were looking for. Come on Over went to number 1 on the UK album charts for 11 weeks. It became the biggest selling album of the year in Great Britain and a bestseller in other big European markets as well, selling more than one million copies in Germany and nearly 4 million in the UK alone. Although "You're Still The One" and the pop version of "From This Moment On" cracked the Top 10 of the UK charts and "When" had minor success in the Top 20, the songs that had finally drawn European attention to the album were the pop remixed singles "That Don't Impress Me Much", a No.3 in the UK and Top 10 hit in Germany in the summer of 1999, and "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" which peaked at No.3 in both the UK and France in autumn of that year. Additionally, "You've Got a Way" was remixed specifically for inclusion on the Notting Hill soundtrack. Subsequently, a reissue of the international version of the album was released worldwide, including the US and Europe, containing three of these new remixes. Additionally, the album set the record for the longest ever stay in the Top 20 of the Billboard 200, remaining in the Top 20 for 99 weeks.
In 1998, Twain launched her first major concert tour, aided by her manager Jon Landau, a veteran of many large-scale tours with Bruce Springsteen. The Come on Over Tour shows was a success and won the "Country Tour of the Year" in 1998 and 1999 by Pollstar Concert Industry Awards.[40]
In 2000, Twain was initially scheduled to release a Christmas album, but plans to release one were cancelled later in the year.[41]
Following the success of Come On Over, independent label Limelight Records released The Complete Limelight Sessions in October 2001. The album includes 16 tracks recorded in the late 1980s before Twain signed her record deal with Mercury.
After a change in management – QPrime replaced Landau — and a two-year break, along with the birth of their son, Eja (pronounced "Asia") D'Angelo, who was born on August 12, 2001,[42] Twain and Lange returned to the studio. Up! was released on November 19, 2002. About a year later, Twain kicked off the Up! Tour in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada on September 25, 2003. Up! was released with three different discs – country/acoustic (green CD), pop/rock (red CD), and world/dance (blue CD). Up! was given four out of five stars by Rolling Stone magazine, and debuted at No.1 on the Billboard albums chart, selling 874,000 in the first week alone. It remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. Up! reached No.1 in Germany, No.2 in Australia and the Top Five in the UK and France. In Germany, Up! was certified 4x platinum and stayed in the Top 100 for one and a half years. The international music disc was remixed with Indian-style orchestral and percussion parts recorded in Mumbai, India. The new versions were produced by Simon and Diamond Duggal, brothers from Birmingham, England. They were originally invited to contribute parts to the pop version of "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!" which retained the Indian influence.[43]
Twain's popularity in UK was reflected by numerous appearances on the long-running music show Top of the Pops, performing singles from Come on Over from 1999. In 2002 an entire special show was dedicated to her on sister show TOTP2, in which Twain herself introduced some past performances of her greatest hits and new singles from Up!
The first single from the album, "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!" became a top 10 country hit in the US, after debuting at No. 24 after only five days of airplay; but only made the Top 40 on the pop charts. It was a much bigger hit on the other side of the Atlantic, released in a pop version, the single hit No.4 in the UK. In Australia, Germany and France the song reached the Top 15 in each case. The follow-up single, "Up!", reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but failed to reach the pop Top 40. The second European single became the mid-tempo song "Ka-Ching!" (which was never released as a single in North America) with lyrics where Twain was criticizing unchecked consumerism. The song eventually became another smash hit in the important European markets, reaching No.1 in Germany and Austria and other European countries, the UK Top 10 and the Top 15 in France. The third single from the album would be the most successful in the US. The romantic ballad "Forever and For Always" was released as a single in April 2003 and peaked at No.4 on the country chart and No.1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and made as well the Billboard Top 20. Again success was even bigger on the other side of the Atlantic with "Forever and For Always" again reaching the Top 10 in both, the UK and Germany. Further singles were "She's Not Just a Pretty Face", which was a country Top 10 hit, while the last US single, "It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing", made the Top 20 on both Country and AC. Due to the enormous European success of Up! and its first three singles, two more singles were released in the second half of 2003 with up-tempo "Thank You Baby" (#11 in the UK, Top 20 in Germany) and just before Christmas the romantic, acoustic ballad "When You Kiss Me", at least a minor hit in both territories. The title track "Up!" also saw a single release in a limited edition of European countries, such as Germany, in early 2004. In January 2008, Up! had sold 5.5 million copies in the U.S. and was certified by the RIAA as 11x platinum (the organization counts double albums as two units).[36]
In 2004, she released the Greatest Hits album, with three new tracks. As of 2012, it had sold over 4.15 million copies in the U.S.[36] The first single, the multi-format duet "Party for Two", made the country top ten with Billy Currington, while the pop version with Sugar Ray lead singer Mark McGrath made top ten in the United Kingdom and Germany. The follow-up singles, "Don't!" and "I Ain't No Quitter" did not fare as well. The former made Top 20 on Adult Contemporary, while the latter did not gain enough airplay to crack the Country Top 40.[44]
In June 2009, Twain released a letter to her fans explaining the delays in the release of her next album.[45] In August 2009, at a conference in Timmins, Ontario, a spokesman for Twain's label said a new record from the singer is still "nowhere in sight".[46]
In May 2011, Twain confirmed in an interview with Perez Hilton that she will release her first new single in six years, "Today Is Your Day", after the finale of Why Not? with Shania Twain.[47] Twain previewed the song in the first episode of the series.[47] Twain worked with music producers David Foster and Nathan Chapman on the new song.[48] In the next few months, Twain plans to return to the studio to finish her fifth studio album.[49] "Today Is Your Day" was officially released to iTunes and country radio on June 12, 2011.[50]
On June 8, 2011, at a press conference at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Twain announced that she will headline Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for two years.[50] Her show, titled Still The One, began on December 1, 2012 with shows expected to run in 2013 and 2014.
In July 2013, Twain announced on Facebook that she is working on her album over the summer during a break from Still The One. This will be her fifth studio album and first in 12 years.
In October 2013, Twain sat down with Robin Roberts from Good Morning America as a featured artist on the Countdown to the CMA Awards. In the interview, Twain insisted a new album was coming, but she was still in the process to find the right producer.
Outside of her show at Caesars Palace, Twain will perform two concerts at the Calgary Stampede in Calgary, Alberta on July 9 and 10, 2014. Alongside her Calgary Stampede shows, Shania is also the headliner for a show on Labor Day weekend at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. [50]
Twain's mainstream pop acceptance was further helped by her appearance in the 1998 first edition of the VH1 Divas concert where she sang alongside Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan and Aretha Franklin, and also by VH1's 1999 heavily aired Behind the Music, which concentrated on the tragic aspects of her early life as well as her physical attractiveness and Nashville's early resistance to her bare-midriff music videos. After Divas, Shania Twain wrote and/or sang background vocals with her then husband Robert John "Mutt" Lange the songs, "If Walls Could Talk" and "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)" for Celine Dion.
On November 12, 2008 Twain made her first television appearance since her split from ex-husband Robert "Mutt" Lange, where she appeared as a surprise presenter at the 42nd CMA Awards.[51]
On August 17, 2009, EW announced that Twain would be a guest judge on American Idol in Chicago, for the show's August 30 and 31 episodes.[52]
In April 2010, Twain announced plans for her own TV show, titled Why Not? with Shania Twain. The show debuted on May 8, 2011 on OWN.[53] Twain returned to American Idol as a guest mentor for a week where the top 6 contestants showcased her songs.[54] After the conclusion of the ninth season Twain was very close to becoming a judge but ultimately it was Jennifer Lopez who got the job.[55]
In 2003, Twain participated in the Dolly Parton tribute album Just Because I'm a Woman, covering Parton's classic "Coat of Many Colors", with backing vocals by Alison Krauss. The cover peaked at No.57 on the Hot Country Songs charts as an album cut. During the Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show Twain performed two songs, "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" and "Up!"[citation needed]
Twain joined Canadian singer Anne Murray on the song "You Needed Me" on Murray's Anne Murray Duets: Friends and Legends album released November 13, 2007 in Canada, and on January 15, 2008 in the U.S.[56]
In July 2011, fellow Canadian superstar Michael Bublé confirmed in a live video chat with fans that he recorded a duet of 'White Christmas' with Twain for his 2011 Christmas album.[57]
On February 7, 2012, Lionel Richie's single "Endless Love" featuring Shania Twain was released to digital retailers. The single is the first single from Lionel's "Tuskegee" album released on March 27, 2012. "Endless Love" has been released to radio on the adult contemporary charts. A music video, directed by Paul Boyd, was released to country music channels CMT and GAC in March 2012.[citation needed]
Twain's commercial ventures outside the music industry included a series of cosmetic ads in 1999 based on "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" for Revlon. She also starred in ads for Candie's shoes and Gitano jeans, who also sponsored her 1998–1999 Come On Over Tour.[citation needed]
In January 2005, Twain joined Scentstories by Febreze to create a limited edition scent disc with the proceeds going to America's Second Harvest.[58]
Late in 2005, Twain partnered COTY to produce her namesake fragrance "Shania" by Stetson. A second fragrance was released in September 2007, called "Shania Starlight".[59]
On January 1, 2010, Twain carried the Olympic Torch through her hometown as part of the 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay.[60]
Twain met producer Robert "Mutt" Lange after he heard her original songs and singing from her debut album; he then offered to produce and write songs with her. They first met at Nashville's Fan Fair in June 1993 and quickly became close. They were married on December 28, 1993 and Twain gave birth to their son Eja (pronounced Asia) in August 2001.[citation needed]
On May 15, 2008, a spokesperson for Mercury Nashville announced that Twain and Lange were separating after Lange allegedly had an affair with Twain's best friend, Marie-Anne Thiébaud.[61][62] Their divorce was finalized on June 9, 2010.[63] On December 20, 2010, Twain's manager confirmed that Twain was engaged to Frédéric Thiébaud (the Swiss ex-husband of her former best friend), an executive at Nestlé.[64][65] They married on January 1, 2011 in Rincón, Puerto Rico.[66]
In 2009, Twain was rated as having the Perfect Face, by scientists. The study, led by the University of Toronto and the University of California, San Diego, appears in the journal Vision Research. The results suggest her face has a perfect set of geometric measurements, based on the Golden Ratio.[67]
In September 2010, it was confirmed that Twain was to release her autobiography, From This Moment On, on May 3, 2011,[68] and the cover work for the book was released on March 2, 2011.[69] Twain is a devotee of Sant Mat, an Eastern spiritual philosophy which calls for daily meditation as well as abstinence from alcohol, drugs and premarital sex.[70]
Twain is a long-time vegetarian[71] and in 2001, was voted PETA's first Sexiest Vegetarian Alive.[72] She started completely abstaining from meat after she married Lange in 1993. She cites moral reasons for her diet saying,
"I don't eat meat, fish, or eggs. Nothing that had to die... I think there's something odd about eating another living anything."[73]
In addition to her various awards for her singles and albums, Twain has received a number of personal honours:
She was named the 1999 Entertainer of the Year by both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association; Twain was the first non-US citizen to win the CMA award.
The city of Timmins Ontario, renamed a street for her, gave her the key to the city, and built the Shania Twain Centre in her honour.[76]
Twain was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the Juno Awards on March 27, 2011.[citation needed]
On June 2, 2011, Twain received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her star is the 2,442nd Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Category of Recording.[75]

=======================================================
                A tragically poor childhood prompted her name change and a passion for country music made her a star. Album sales of 34 million and Grammys galore prove she's still the one.Shania Twain was born Eileen Edwards, on 28 August 1965, in Ontario, Canada. She was raised in the small mining town of Timmins, Ontario, by her mother, Sharon, and stepfather, an Ojibway Indian named Gerald Twain. (She later changed her name from Eileen to "Shania"; an Ojibway word meaning "I'm on my way"). Twain was already singing and writing songs by age 10; as a teenager, she performed on Canadian television. In 1987, her mother and stepfather were tragically killed in a car accident, leaving Twain to care for her three younger siblings. After several years spent earning money by singing at a local resort, Twain went to Nashville in 1993. She immediately signed with Mercury Records and released her self-titled debut album. That same year, Twain married South African music producer Robert "Mutt" Lange, who was known for his work with the heavy metal bands AC/DC, Def Leppard, and Foreigner. With the help of Lange, Twain released ‘The Woman in Me’ in 1995, which sold 12 million copies, becoming the bestselling country album by a female artist in history. The album, which yielded the hit songs ‘Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?’, ‘Any Man of Mine,’ and ‘(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!’ earned Twain a Grammy Award for Best Country Album. In 1997, Twain released her third album, ‘Come On Over’, which contained eight hit singles, including ‘You're Still the One,’ ‘Love Gets Me Everytime,’ ‘That Don't Impress Me Much,’ ‘Honey, I'm Home,’ ‘From this Moment On,’ and ‘You've Got a Way.’ Certified by the Recording Institute Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 17 million copies, Come On Over holds the notable distinction of being the bestselling country album of all time. Shania Twain's combination of a powerful voice and sexy image has made her one of the most popular singers in both country and pop music. Her popularity opened the door for such female country crossover acts as Faith Hill and LeAnn Rimes. In the late 1990s, Twain signed a reported $3 million contract with Revlon cosmetics to endorse their products. In 1999, she released a fourth album, ‘On the Way’. Twain also re-recorded the single ‘You've Got a Way’ for the motion picture soundtrack ‘Notting Hill’ (1999). In 2002, Twain released the album ‘Up!’ She released a Greatest Hits album in 2004, which included a duet with Billy Currington, ‘Party For Two.’ In 2005, she released ‘Send It With Love’ and ‘Beginnings’. Twain and Lange moved to their 19th-century estate in Tour-de-Peliz, Switzerland. In August 2001, they welcomed their first child, a son named Eja (pronounced "Asia"). The couple however, parted ways after 14 years of marriage on 15 May 2008 after Lange had an affair with Twain's friend, Marie-Anne Thiebaud. Following the split, Twain said in an interview with The Toronto Sun: "I really lost my sense of trust, compassion, honesty. I have lost my ability to express myself and my ability to sing". It was announced by her manager on 20 December 2010 that Twain was engaged to Marie-Ann's ex-husband, Swiss business executive Frederic Thiebaud, and the couple married on 1 January 2011 in Puerto Rico. Twain was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall Of Fame on 27 March 2010, during Canada's music awards, the Junos. She is currently the recipient of 12 Juno awards. Future projects for the singer-songwriter include a TV show entitled ‘Why Not? With Shania Twain’, which is due to air in April 2011, on the Oprah Winfrey Network. The show is set to cover personal topics for Twain, such as how she has coped with her divorce, how she has found her creative voice and what her plans are for the future. She is also set to release her autobiography in April. Judith Curr, executive vice president and the publisher of Atria Books and Washington Square Press who will be publishing the book, said: "When I read Shania's manuscript, it amazed me how rich, clear, unfiltered and honest she was."

Emerging in the mid-'90s, Shania Twain became the most popular country music artist since Garth Brooks. Skillfully fusing mainstream, AOR rock production with country-pop, Twain and her producer/husband, Robert John "Mutt" Lange, created a commercial juggernaut with her second album, The Woman in Me. The record became a multi-platinum phenomenon, peaking at number five on the pop charts and eventually selling over nine million copies in America alone. Twain might have sold a lot of records, but like other mega-selling acts before her, she earned few good reviews -- most critics accused her of diluting country with bland, anthemic hard rock techniques and shamelessly selling her records with sexy videos. Fans ignored such complaints, mainly because her audience was comprised of many listeners who had grown accustomed to such marketing strategies by constant exposure to MTV. And Twain, in many ways, was the first country artist to fully exploit MTV's style. She created a sexy, video-oriented image -- she didn't even tour during the year when The Woman in Me was on the top of the country charts -- that appealed not only to the country audience, but also to pop fans. In turn, she became a country music phenomenon.
Twain was born in Windsor, Ontario, and raised in the small, rural town of Timmins, Ontario. As a child, she learned to play guitar at an early age and would spend much of her time singing, writing, and playing. Early on in her musical development, her parents pushed her on-stage, making her perform frequently around their little town; often, she would be pulled out of bed around one in the morning to sing at local bars, since as a child she could only appear in the clubs after they had stopped serving alcohol. In addition to bars, she sang on local radio and television stations and community events. When she was 21 years old, both of her parents died in a car crash, forcing her to take responsibility for her four siblings. In order to pay the bills and keep food on the table, she took a job singing at a resort in Deerhurst. With the money she earned at the resort, she bought a house and had the family settle down. 
At the resort, she sang show tunes, from George Gershwin to Andrew Lloyd Webber, as well as a little country. Twain stayed there for three years, at the end of which all of her siblings had begun lives of their own. When she was finally independent again, she assembled a demo tape of her songs, and her manager set up a showcase concert in Canada. Twain caught the attention of a few insiders with the concert, and within a few months Mercury Nashville had signed her to their roster. Her eponymous debut album was released in 1993, and although it wasn't a major hit, it performed respectably in the United States, launching two minor hit singles, "What Made You Say That" and "Dance with the One That Brought You"; in Europe, the album was more successful and Country Music Television Europe named her Rising Video Star of the Year.
Shortly after the release of Shania Twain, the singer met and fell in love with Robert John "Mutt" Lange, a hard rock producer known for his work with AC/DC, Def Leppard, Foreigner, and the Cars. Lange had been wanting to move into country music for a while, and after hearing Twain's debut album, he decided to get in contact with her with the intention of working on an album. By the end of the year, the pair had married and begun working on her second record. The two either wrote or co-wrote the material that eventually formed The Woman in Me.
The Woman in Me was released in the spring of 1995. Its first single, "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?," went to number 11 early in the year, quickly followed by "Any Man of Mine," which became her first number one single in the spring. The album's title track went to number 14 in the fall, while the fourth single, "(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!," rocketed to number one toward the end of the year; early in 1996 "No One Needs to Know" became her third number one hit. By the beginning of 1996, The Woman in Me had sold over six million copies and broken the record for the most weeks spent at number one on the country charts. During the course of 1996, it would rack another three million in sales. Come on Over followed in 1997. She spent the next two years touring the globe in support of the album; by the end of 1999, Come on Over had sold 36 million copies.  
Twain took a sabbatical and returned to her Swiss home for some down time with her husband. The next summer, she and Lange welcomed their first child. A son, whom they named Eja, arrived August 21, 2001. During this time, Twain brainstormed for a fourth album. While balancing a domestic life and a career, the end result was Up!, which appeared in November 2002. 
Up! was released to considerable fanfare - not only was it accompanied by a huge publicity blitz but it appeared in three different mixes, designed to appeal to country, pop and international audiences - and it initially was a big success, selling over 870,000 copies in the US upon its first week and debuting at number one in the Billboard charts, but despite such hits as “I'm Gonna Getcha Good!” and “Forever and For Always,” it failed to have the same kind of staying power as The Woman In Me or Come On Over. Those two albums sold over 10 million copies a piece in the US, whereas Up! sold 5.5 million -- an impressive number that only pales when compared to her track record. As Up! worked its way down the charts, Shania released a Greatest Hits album in the holiday season of 2004; the compilation was a great success, going triple platinum in the US, where it peaked at number two on the Billboard charts. In the wake of Greatest Hits, Twain spent the next few years quietly, working on several non-music related projects and appearing only on soundtracks. As of 2007, she was still working on her follow-up to Up!. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

1967Early ChangesBorn Eilleen Regina Edwards, Twain is only 2 when her father, Clarence Edwards, divorces her mother, Sharon. In 1971, Sharon remarries Jerry Twain, an Ojibwa Indian, and he adopts and raises Shania in the rural Canadian mining town of Timmins, Ontario. "My dad's side of the family was the side we grew up with," Twain tells PEOPLE of her upbringing with Jerry. "So it was the Indians that were really our family." By 8, she's singing in clubs in the middle of the night. Her parents often wake her at 1 a.m. to go perform after last call. Stardom was "their dream," she tells PEOPLE in 1995. "I dreamed about being a kid." 1987NovemberParty of FourTwain parents are killed in a head-on collision. Only 22, Twain cares for her three teenage siblings by singing at the upscale Deerhurst Resort in Huntsville, Ontario. "I was overwhelmed with a lot of decisions," Twain later tells PEOPLE. But, she adds, "What I learned through all of that was how strong I was capable of being. I didn't fall apart. I kept it together, paid the bills, took care of the kids, did the groceries, cooked and cleaned and still kept down a job."1991-1993Finding a MuttOnce her siblings are old enough to take care of themselves, Twain pursues her dreams in Nashville, signing a record deal with Mercury Nashville, which releases her 1993 self-titled debut album. Around that time, Twain begins writing songs over the phone with reclusive London-based producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange. In June 1993, after months of working together, they finally meet in person. By December, they're married. "It was just like a dream," Twain tells EW. 1995February 07Superstar StatusCo-writing 10 of the 12 tracks on The Woman in Me with Lange, Twain becomes a household name with the record, which sells 12 million copies. "He deserves all the credit I can give him," she tells EW. "But at the same time, I don't discredit myself." She receives four Grammy nominations the following year, winning for Best Country Album. 1997November 04Over the TopBuoyed by making the Top 10 hit list with "From This Moment On," "You're Still the One" and "That Don't Impress Me Much," Twain's third release Come on Over becomes the fifth-best selling album of all time, selling 34 million copies worldwide and making her only the second woman (Whitney Houston is the other) to have two albums sell more than 10 million copies each. Her success lands her on the cover of Rolling Stone.1999February 24Yowza!At the Grammy Awards, Twain squeezes into a skintight dominatrix ensemble to perform her hit "Man! I Feel like a Woman!". The racy, nontraditional Nashville get-up doesn't keep her from winning awards for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Song. "I've never been out to offend people or do things for the sake of being different," she tells PEOPLE. "As long as I'm comfortable, and I like what I see in the mirror, I go for it." In September, she wins her first Country Music Association Award for Entertainer of the Year.2001August 12Shania Welcomes EjaNow living in the Chateau de Sully, a 19th-century mansion in Switzerland the couple bought in 1998, Twain gives birth to son, Eja (pronounced Asia) D'Angelo Lange. "I don't feel like a star there," she tells PEOPLE in 2002. "I needed to leave behind the whole 'Shania' thing and be myself." 2002November 19Double the PleasureTwain makes her latest album, Up!, a double CD, creating several versions of its 19 tracks. According to Time, the original pop version contains snare drum hits and techno arrangements, while the second disc sprinkles the tracks with mandolin and slide guitar to appeal to her country fans. Listeners in Europe get a different second disc, which features songs set to, as she puts it, "an Asian, Indian vibe." 2008MayShania & Mutt's SplitTwain returns to the spotlight–but not with good news: she and Lange split after 14 years together. The breakup is reportedly caused by Lange's relationship with Marie-Anne Thiébaud, 37, a longtime secretary and house manager of the couple's estate. "Mutt and Marie-Anne left their spouses for each other and are still in a relationship," a source tells PEOPLE, adding that "Shania considered Marie-Anne one of her best friends." In a PEOPLE cover story, Thiébaud denies the allegations. Twain says on her website, "I have so much to say but I know the best way for me to speak is through my music." November 12Shania Steps OutTwain makes her first public appearance since announcing her split from Lange at the 2008 Country Music Awards. The singer surprises the crowd and presents Kenny Chesney with the Entertainer of the Year award. "It's good to see all of you too," Twain tells the audience after being greeted by a standing ovation. "I hope to be seeing a lot more of you."

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Shania Twain was born as Eilleen Regina Edwards in 1965, the middle of three daughters to Clarence and Sharon Edwards (sister Jill is two years older and Carrie-Ann three years younger). When she was age 6, her mother remarried Jerry Twain, a full-blooded Ojibwa native from Timmins, Ontario, who adopted her as his own. She started out singing in bars as a child after hours, and, at 13, appeared on The Tommy Hunter Show (1965). When she was 22, her parents were killed in an accident, and she became the legal guardian of her half-brothers (Mark, then 13, and Darryl, then 14) and sister, putting her musical career on hold to raise her family. In 1991 she changed her name to Shania (meaning "I'm on my way" in Ojibwa, it was the name of a co-worker), and signed a contract with Mercury Nashville that same year. Her first album went by without notice, but her second album (produced with (Mutt) Robert John Lange, who she wed in 1993) broke world records with its sales!
      Listed in "People Weekly"s "Most Intriguing People" list. (December 25, 1995/January 1, 1996 issue)
      Has scored seven No. 1 hits on Billboard magazine's country singles chart. Her biggest hit is the country-pop smash "You're Still the One" (1998, No. 1 country, No. 2 Hot 100); the song won Grammy Awards for Best Country song and Best Female Country Performance.
      Her biggest country hit, 1997's "Love Gets Me Every Time," became the first country No. 1 released by a female country artist to spend five weeks atop Billboard's country chart since Dolly Parton's 1977 hit "Here You Come Again.".
      Named the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year in 1999. She also received the CMA's International Achievement Award that same year.
      Is one of only four native Canadians to reach the peak of Billboard's country chart since its inception in 1944. The other top hit makers are Hank Snow (who first turned the trick in 1950), Anne Murray (first No. 1 hit in 1974), and Terri Clark (first No. 1 hit in 1999).
      Her other country No. 1 hits: "Any Man of Mine" (1995); "(If You're Not in it for Love) I'm Outta Here!" "You Win My Love" and "No One Needs to Know" (1996); and "Honey I'm Home" (1998). Other big hits include "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under" and "The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)" (1995); "Don't Be Stupid," "From This Moment On" and "That Don't Impress Me Much" (all 1998, the second a duet with country singer Bryan White); and "Man!

      Her album "Up!" (2002) sold two million copies in the United States during its first month of release.
      Shy as a child, was a tomboy and hated performing. Started writing songs when she was 8 years old.

      Her stepfather and mother's common headstone bears the family name "Twain" underscored by the names "Jerry 1947-1987" and "Sharon 1945-1987" with the epitaph - Together Forever.
      Shania's music video "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" (1997) parodied Robert Palmer's "Addicted to Love" (1986) in that the gender roles were reversed, with Twain fronting a band of 5 male models playing guitars, drums and a keyboard.
      Starting her latest tour on September 25th which will last until mid-December. [September 2003]
      [on inviting audience members to join her onstage] I do try to assess 'Is this person drunk?' or 'Is this person going to be hysterical and not manageable?' And so I do watch the body language. I don't always get it quite right, but I've never had any security issues.
      [on incorporating live animals into her act] They have a mind of their own. Sometimes they'll pee onstage or sometimes they'll poo. We just never know really what's going to happen. The unpredictability keeps us on our toes.
=======================================================
Shania Twain’s personal struggles are already country music legend: Her poverty-stricken family, her struggle to support her younger relatives after the death of her parents, her recent divorce from Mutt Lange. But the 45-year-old singer’s new autobiography, From This Moment On (on sale today), is packed with intimate details that may surprise even her most dedicated fans. Here are a few of the most shocking:
 Twain says her family was physically and emotionally abused for years by Jerry Twain, her mother’s husband. (Twain is estranged from her biological father.) In one chilling passage, Twain recalls watching Jerry plunge her mother’s head into the toilet repeatedly after knocking her out cold. Years later, 11-year-old Shania (then called Eilleen) would summon the courage to fight back against her father. “I ran up behind my dad with a chair in both hands and smashed it across his back… Before I could get away, he punched me in the jaw. Adrenaline pumping, I punched him back!”
Twain also says she was sexually abused by Jerry, who muttered obscene slurs at her while she was in bed and once fondled her when she was a teenager. She eventually convinced her mother to run away with the family to a shelter in Toronto.
 Living in poverty in rural Canada often forced the family to make do with little. Twain recalls days on end when the family had nothing to eat but “goulash”: dry bread with boiled milk and brown sugar. She also mentions wearing bread bags on her feet when her family couldn’t afford proper boots for keeping warm in the winter.
Twain says she was devastated when her husband, Mutt Lange, left her for Marie-Anne Thiébaud in 2008. “I’ll be honest: when your husband leaves you, and falls into the arms of your close friend, your self-esteem can really suffer.”
Twain begged Marie-Anne Thiébaud to leave Lange in an email: “I don’t want life or love anymore… Why are you torturing me? Let it go. Pleeeeeaaaaaaasssseee!!!!!”
During the split, Twain cried constantly and took five baths a day. At one point, she helped herself recover from the pain of the split by allowing herself to call Marie-Anne Thiébaud an female anatomical epithet . “It was kind of cathartic. (Harsh, I know, but after all, it is only a word.) My emotions were so balled up inside me that it felt good to release.”
Now 45 and remarried to Marie-Anne’s ex-husband, Frédéric Thiébaud, Twain deals with constant anxiety about her appearance and the effects of age. “I’m pretty insecure about my changing body… I’m letting ‘the girls’ hang loose under my sweat clothes around the house and when someone comes to the door, I cross my arms under them for support.”
Interesting that when her career was at an all time high, she didn’t have a single bad thing to say about Jerry Twain, even though he was dead at the time. I remember her on Behind The Music – she couldn’t say enough good things about him.
That is so strange, I was thinking the same thing!  I watched the behind the music special years ago and she didn’t say anything bad about, acted like he was the best stepfather in the world.  Why say all of these things now?  Doesn’t even seem like the same guy. Strange.
I always love women who jump on the “she wants publicity, so she must be lying” bandwagon when it comes to a celebrity revealing details of abuse. I bet you like to watch “The Bachelor” because it’s so nice to see two people really fall in love, too.
Life is lonely,I envy my best friend very much, a young CEO, rich and handsome, just has announced his wedding with a beautiful woman .. now I am seeking a good woman who can give me real love , so i got a username Gr8TLover on—-Wêálthy`Connêct,,C óM—– .it is the first and best club forwealthy people and their admirers. ..…you don’t have to be rich ,but you can meet one there ,maybe you wanna check it out or tell your friends !
~~~~~~~~I am not spitting out venom. I am a big fan. I just question the difference in the stories. Why is it wrong to ask questions?
From then to now I would imagine there have been some intensive therapy sessions. Give the woman room.
What I found odd is that on her Oprah appearance last week, she talked about what a great guy her stepfather was, and how everyone loved him, even as she told a horrific story about how he knocked her mother out and kept dunking her head in the toilet!  We survivors of abuse are an odd lot…
IF YOU understand child abuse, then you would see she was trying to remember only the good in her childhood. It affects your self worth; to tell everyone how much you suffered at the hands of a parent,t is very difficult.
 She had made it ‘huge’ in her career. There was no need to tell of the pain she endured.  She wanted to pretend she lived a normal life, why not?  She didn’t need pity.
  Once her life fell apart, she was able to express the hurt in her life.  It is a part of the healing we must go through to get to  the other side.  Admire her courage, respect her  and  don’t snip at her with snide comments about pain sells.  Don’t be a dip!
 If you didn’t suffer child abuse, lucky you, many have and need to be respected for surviving it; especially when they do outstanding things with their lives.  She could have ended up a drug addict, married many times and drifting through life.  You go shania!  Proud of you woman!!!!!
@@JD, I wasn’t trying to be rude, just trying to add to the conversation.  Apologies for not being perfect.
Its all good. People make mistakes. I had to read that part twice to understand who the abuser was.  The “hotshot” reference was uncalled for.
Shania..I love you, always will, but why the negative comments all of the sudden about Jerry? People were denouncing this man as your father, more less, and now he’s done all fo this stuff…why is this coming out in the open?
@JD – The confusion resulted from the following statement in the article:  Years later, 11-year-old Shania (then called Eilleen) would summon the courage to fight back against her father. “I ran up behind my dad with a chair in both hands and smashed it across his back…
I thought the same about the “Behind the music” special. I thought she said that they were so in love that it was the inspiration to all her love songs. ?? I think it is odd, so many of us remember that.
(1) I’m pretty sure Shania has enough millions that she isn’t hurting to make more money to stay alive or pay her bills.  She doesn’t need to execute publicity stunts in order to get paid (2) Is Shania only allowed to talk about her life when other people think it would be best for her to do so?  Or should she talk about it when she is ready to do so?  At this point in her career, with her divorce, getting re-married, and all of the emotional stuff she is dealing with, why would she NOT want to talk about everything now and lay it all out there in the open?  Besides, I’m pretty sure that even if she randomly released the book with nothing to promote people would still spew nonsense about her because that’s how a lot of people are, cynical and judgmental (3) Shania has enough fans and has sold enough albums that she doesn’t need to do anything to stay popular (4) Do any of you think or feel anything when you spit out your venom like snakes?
I am not spitting out venom. I am a big fan. I just question the difference in the stories. Why is it wrong to  ask questions?
hopefully even small minded people could at least understand how humiliating it must be to have that in your past. Also to have it in your past while being famous. I would be interested to see how open you would be if you were abused.
I agree it is very difficult to come from an abusive past. Then having your husband a man you love and trust, have an affair and leave her with her best friend is stab in the back. You’re one classy woman Shania.
I remember that Behind The Music. I am so shocked by her comments. Nothing but nice things were said about that man. It appeared as if he rescued them when he married her Mom. Something is just not right here.
Me too. When I heard of the abuse, I assumed it was the biodad and that’s why they were estranged. Really shocked that it was the step dad.
So true. I remember when there was debate about her last name. There was an article that came out years ago saying how her last name really isn’t Twain and she’s not half Ojibwa, as initially thought.  She spoke about being devasted when the article came out because, in her own words: “who are they to say he’s not my daddy?”  She felt hurt and she was always incessant about carrying his last name. It’s all so odd that now we come to find out he was abusive.  I love her and I support her but I’m a little baffled. Can’t wait to hear what she says about this on Oprah today, if this even gets talked about.
I remember the exact same thing. I’ll have to hear what she has to say about it all. Maybe she felt like the abuse was none of our business at the time.  Now she may be in a different space.
Its really none of our business , how would anyone like to share the deepest pain with the whole world while trying to make them feel good with their music.
I’ve been wondering if she could still have it in her to sell a new record in big numbers without the guidance of Mutt Lange. I don’t consider her Country but more of a pop artist. She should go back and do a “return to roots” Country record, IMO. Her brand of “Country” kind of ruined Country (along with Garth Brooks) for me.
Wow Sad Stuff. Sexual and family violence, That is so sad! You know people sometimes it’s best to keep details like this private because Shania was happy then with Mutt! He hurt her I guess she felt she needed to get her self out there and her story told! God Bless her that women has been through hell
I agree.  It is very sad stuff. I understand why she could not open back then.  Now, she is willing to get it all out there to heal and move on.  She is very beautiful, strong and talented individual.  I also agree that this is one woman that does not need the publicity or the money.  It will be great to see her come back.
It takes a lot of courage and strength to talk about your past especially physical and emotional abuse. Maybe she just wasn’t ready for the world to know about her true past.  I think she is an incredible entertainer…Mutt Lange can write music and produce but when it boils down to it, it was Shania who sang those song and Shania who got and stage and performed.  Not Mutt.
This is all so true.It is best if sexually and physically abused people talk to someone about it, but it takes a while sometimes to be able to do it.Her voice, sound,and everything is what I have cared about.If Elvis had lived, I would have still loved his music even if he was 90yrs.I don’t care about her appearance,she will always be a great singer.God Bless Her and heal her.
Too bad she didn’t save those plastic bread bags, sounds like she could use something to hold those “bags” up.
What an ass you are!  Shame on your comment!  It is people like you who make women feel awful about maturing!
If you are a CHILD being abused, you are not able to defend yourself against a grown adult.  Not only do you not understand why they are doing these things, you can’t fight back and win.
  She struggeld to find some normal part of her childhood to remember and cherished the good times she kept in her mind.  THINK about it, he more than likely was a great guy to those around him, most abuser are.  He was able to allow himself to feel his failures at home and took it out on his wife and kids!
 People, Thank God you don’t have to understand why she did the things she did.  If you were a child in that situation you would be struggling to make some sense of WHY ME? What did I do wrong to make him hate me so?  To make it more confusing, he could be kind and loving, when he did, she felt whole and loved, those are your good times, you tend to hold on to them and make them bigger than they were!  She is a remarkab le woman, talented and loving to her family.  She is a rare find these days! Goid bless her and may she find true peace in her life.
Twain recalls watching Jerry plunge her mother’s head into the toilet repeatedly after knocking her out cold… I’m letting ‘the girls’ hang loose under my sweat clothes around the house and when someone comes to the door, I cross my arms under them for support.”
I wonder if her new HUSBAND Fred has read her book…seems to be alot of them still on the shelf at stores and at half price too…hmmm, tells me something.
I’m conflicted. As an abuse victim, I don’t want to doubt anyone’s story but I instantly do when the first claims of abuse also coincide with the release of a book/movie/album, etc. I believed Robin Givens and Denise Richards yet I can’t put stock in Shania or Meredeith Baxter. It’s just horror to be terrorized by someone in your own home but I find it worse to make a claim just for personal gain.
If you have ever seen the made for TV movie about Shania there are mega hints in there that there was abuse. As you must know, as an abuse victim yourself, there is always a Love-hate relationship when the abuser is supposed to be your care taker.  You “have to” love them, but secretly you hate them and get very good at pretending nothings wrong, and you feel ashamed and certainly don’t want the world knowing about it. Maybe even write songs about fantasy love instead in order to cope.
Growing up and realising that the past has never really been dealt with just pushed under the rug, is a huge learning opportunity and it really helps to write it down.  And if she can’t sing anymore (as she says) then getting it to the fans in the form of a book is the way to do it.
E Benoit, I think you must be very smart.  People who’ve been abused become experts at pretending everything is okay.  They’re often hiding the truth even from themselves because it’s too painful even to think about.  Eventually it becomes freeing to get the story out there, either to just friends or the public at large if you’re famous.  And people get to that point in their own time.
IF you are an abuse victim, you should have some understanding of this situation.  How could she sort out her life, without starting from the beginning.  Abuse scars us, it hurts our self worth and distorts how we view life.  To grow, one must have the courage to face that abuse and take it apart to understand how it affected us to correct it.  It is hard enough to do that privately, but to have to share it with the world at large, to have those who lack understanding or compassion make snide comments about your pain, requires a very strong person.  My money is on Shania!
“Twain says her family was physically and emotionally abused for years by Jerry Twain, her mother’s husband. (Twain is estranged from her biological father.) In one chilling passage, Twain recalls watching Jerry plunge her mother’s head into the toilet repeatedly after knocking her out cold. Years later, 11-year-old Shania (then called Eilleen) would summon the courage to fight back against her father. “I ran up behind my dad with a chair in both hands and smashed it across his back… Before I could get away, he punched me in the jaw. Adrenaline pumping, I punched him back!”
As for not having reported the dysfunction in her family sooner, when you’re at the top of your game, it’s a bit … well, ‘whiney’ to complain about how awful your childhood was – that it took more years to be able to discuss it is not unusual, not surprising, and in no way ‘negates’ the reality.
Jerry adopted Shania and her two sisters, Jill and Carrie Ann when he married her Mother. So he is her Father, not her step-father.
@ ‘me’, the book reveals the reality of Shania’s childhood – thus, it’s perfectly logical that Shania would be discussing those childhood issues now, with the release of the book.  It’s not to ‘publicize’ the book, but to discuss what is revealed in the book.
The article clearly states that her biological father and husband abandoned her.  Her stepfather mentally and sexually abused her.  I doubt anyone doubts that this is the truth.
Hardly, it is trauma!  You certainly know about trauma as a child.  So, how about a little compassion?
I always take celebrity memoirs with a grain fo salt, and I am not sure the writer can ever succeed. Just finished Susan Lucci’s pleasant book (no real shockers or drama) and was left wanting more, but more is often what we do not want to hear. Maybe we do not need all these books and maybe some of the experiences we had should be upfront from the start. ???
How can you say she’s “full of shlmt”?  Any psychologist will tell you (I am one) that 1 out of 4 girls will be molested before they reach the age of 10 in our society.  It is HUGELY prevalent, and not until mid-life can people get over the shame to come forward – I believe Shania.
I feel sorry for someone as closed as you are!  You have been damaged, or you are very selfish and chidlish!
Heaven forbid you have any kind of suffering, but if you do, remember your unkind remarks here and hope people are less judgemental of you!
I always thought there had to be a history of abuse due to her song, Black Eyes, Blue Tears. It sounded too personal, like she had lived it. Now we find out she actually had lived it. God Bless Her and all the people who are enduring it even now.
“I’d rather die standing/than livin’ on my knees/beggin’ please…” Boy, did that song help me through some difficult things…

 The world may know Shania Twain as many things: a music legend, a mother, and recently, a fixture in the news for her painful, public divorce and subsequent marriage to a cherished friend. But in this extraordinary autobiography, Shania reveals that she is so much more. She is Eilleen Twain, one of five children born into poverty in rural Canada, where her family often didn't have enough food to send her to school with lunch. She's the teenage girl who helped her mother and young siblings escape to a battered woman's shelter to put an end to the domestic violence in her family home. And she's the courageous twenty-two-year-old who sacrificed to keep her younger siblings together after her parents were tragically killed in a car accident.Shania Twain's life has evolved from a series of pivotal moments, and in unflinching, heartbreaking prose, Shania spares no details as she takes us through the events that have made her who she is. She recounts her difficult childhood, her parents' sudden death and its painful aftermath, her dramatic rise to stardom, her devastating betrayal by a trusted friend, and her joyful marriage to the love of her life. From these moments, she offers profound, moving insights into families, personal tragedies, making sense of one's life, and the process of healing. Shania Twain is a singular, remarkable woman who has faced enormous odds and downfalls, and her extraordinary story will provide wisdom, inspiration, and hope for almost anyone.

       Shania Twain rose to fame in the early 1990s with her debut album Shania Twain (1993), and achieved worldwide success with her 1997 album Come On Over, which became the best-selling album of all time by a female musician, and the best selling country album of all time.  A five-time Grammy Award winner, Twain has also achieved major success as a songwriter, winning 27 BMI Songwriter awards. Despite the fact Twain has released very few albums, she has sold over 75 million albums worldwide to date, including 48 million in the U.S.  Her docu-series on OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network will debut in the spring. This is her first book.

  I adore Shania Twain and really loved reading about her personal journey.SMRIt was very sad to read that her father abused her mom, as well as Shania, during her childhood.Carol A. ButlerI just started reading the book and so far I find it well written and very interesting.Deborah Nordeste
  I have been a Shania fan for a long time. Knowing how secluded and reclusive Shania has been for a lot of years my expectations for this book were not very high. I am so surprised by some of the things she reveals about her past with shocking honesty. It is such a fascinating journey I could not put it down until the very end! I highly recommend this book to anyone regardless if you enjoy her music or not.
By 1999 Shania Twain was on top of the world: her albums sold in the millions, her tours were sell-outs, she was named "Entertainer of the Year" from the Country Music Association, one of only five female acts to ever achieve that honour in the award's 40 year plus history, she was happily married, and was about to start a family. She was able to put the pain of a tragic childhood behind her after her parents were killed in an automobile crash, help raise her siblings, and make it in a very competetive industry and go on to be one of the most popular singers ever. Then suddenly everything changed. "From This Moment On" (also the title of one of Shania's most beautiful love songs)is indeed Shania's autobiography, but it is so much more. This is also a book for survivors for people who have been betrayed by those with whom they loved. For the first time she writes about growing up in poverty in northern Canada sometimes having to go through garbage dumps to find cloths, but always having a dream that she would make it one day. She discusses the highs and lows of the music industry, her eventual love for her first husband Mutt Lange, and how that marriage ended a few years ago after he had an affair with her best friend. The book not only was cathartic for Shania to write about, but the message is clear: adultery can happen to anyone, especially someone as beautiful and talented as Shania Twain, but you can and will survive. After reading Shania's book her message to her readers is clear: if someone hurts you eradicate them totally out of your life. She mentions how she doesn't allow her son to see the woman who is now with her former husband (Shania's former best friend).Read more ›
  I have been a Shania Twain from the beginning with her first album "Shania Twain". In knowing how private she has always been she is very open in this book. There were times when I was crying, laughting and doing both at the same time. I COULD NOT put it down. It is definatley worth reading. I think she accomplished what she set out to do and that was be a voice for other people. I could certainly relate to many of her situations.I wish her only the best and hope to hear her beautiful voice soon. My best to you Shania.
You do not have to be a Shania Twain fan to enjoy this book. You just need to be interested in the struggles that we face in life, and how we can triumph over them, to enjoy this book.  Shania's story is extremely interesting. This poor woman describes growing up with hardly anything to eat, a freezing cold house without heat, a stepdad who abused her Mom in front of Shania and the family, going so far as to stick her Mom's head in a toilet bowl. The man had issues. Yet, Shania still finds a way to hold her Stepdad in high regard, despite all this, because "he tried to take care of his family, worked hard, and showed interest in" her music. I am not one to judge, but Shania's stepdad should have forgotten about his pride, and allowed the family to receive welfare and or other benefits while he had a hard time finding work.  Shania then goes on to detail the horrible day when both of her parents were killed in a car accident, leaving her to raise her siblings. But since the family was poor, Shania and her siblings couldnt enjoy a hot shower before school. No, Shania had to take them to a nearby stream, and wash them in it, before they went to school.  One of the most touching parts of Shania's book was when she was face to face with a Moose, and instead of pulling the trigger on her rifle (her stepdad taught her to hunt when she was young), she realized that He, the Moose, had just as much of a right to live that she did. That, coupled with Shania's hearing a bear in the distance one day, who apparently was cruelly shot by a hunter, but not killed...the poor bear being left to suffer, convinced Shania that the days of killing were over, and she has not only not killed any animals in the last 20 years, but she is a vegetarian as well.Read more ›
  I agree totally with the review by C. Parks of Seattle.  I also really like Shania Twain's music and admire her success in the face of great challenges all her life.  But I found the book disappointing and somewhat disjointed, more of a catharsis for herself than a well-written autobiography.  I also found it disconcerting that she tells of horrible incidents with her stepfather and a few paragraphs later writes most lovingly of him.  She also does not seem to find any fault with Mutt for the affair with Marie-Anne; rather she totally seems to blame her former friend for targeting her husband; relationships are much more complicated than that. I wish Shania much happiness in her new marriage and success in whatever she does.
      book arrived just like it just off the shelf,  kinda wished I could have gotten the paperback edition,  but I enjoyed this hard cover anyway
      A bit sad that she blames the "other woman" for her husbands infidelity instead of holding him responsible for his behavior.
      I always knew she had a tough childhood but it was nothing like I had heard.  It was worse.  It's amazing she was able to build a career out of nothing.  Sheer determination.
      I went through a very similar experience, as Shania, only I couldn't marry the other spouse, because he had died.
      Rather tedious.  Boring.  Expected more.  I thought this would be more in a timeline and more revealing of her breakup and subsequent marriage to the other woman's man.
      This book is a autobiography that is both real and doesn't stray away from difficult topics. Rarely do I buy books like this, but was impressed.
      I am a fan of Shania's music, so I found her book very interesting.  It's nice to read her story as she tells it, rather than read a twisted version in the tabloids.
      After taking wife to the concert in Las Vegas, she thought shed like to read the book.  She's enjoying reading, still in the book.
      I adore Shania Twain and really loved reading about her personal journey. It is well written and easy to relate to- it has made me appreciate her and her music even more so than...
      It was a somewhat boring book in spots especially if you dont know about the music business.Overall a good book.Great seller.
