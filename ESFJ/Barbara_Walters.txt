Barbara Walters[2] (born September 25, 1929)[3] is an American broadcast journalist, author, and television personality. She has hosted morning television shows Today and The View, the television news magazine 20/20, co-anchored the ABC Evening News, and was a contributor to ABC News.
Walters first became known as a television personality when she was a writer and segment producer of "women's interest stories" on the morning NBC News program The Today Show, where she began work with host Hugh Downs in 1962, once even modeling a swimsuit when an expected model did not show up. Because of her excellent interviewing ability and her popularity with the viewers, and when other women left the program, she was eventually allowed more air time. Even though her production duties made her a significant contributor to the show, she had no input in choosing a successor for Hugh Downs when he left the show in 1971. Frank McGee was hired. Although his salary was twice hers,[4] at Frank McGee's death in 1974, because of a clause added to her contract by her agent (a family friend),[5] she acquired the title "co-host", the first woman by that title for any network news or public affairs program.[6] Jim Hartz became her co-host. Two years later, continuing as a pioneer for women, she became the first female co-anchor of any network evening news, working with Harry Reasoner on the ABC News flagship program ABC Evening News (List of ABC Evening News anchors).
From 1979 to 2004, Walters worked as co-host and producer for the ABC newsmagazine 20/20, again appearing with Hugh Downs. From 1976 to 2010, she contributed as an anchor, reporter, and correspondent for ABC News, along with producing and hosting her own special interview programs several times yearly. Beginning in 1997, she has created, and appears as co-host on, The View. Walters retired from ABC News and as co-host of The View on May 16, 2014.[7]
Walters was born in 1929 in Boston to Dena (née Seletsky) and Louis "Lou" Walters (born Louis Abrahams).[9][10] Her parents were both Jewish,[11] and descendants of refugees from the former Russian Empire, now Eastern Europe.[12] Walters' paternal grandfather, Isaac Abrahams, was born in Łódź, Poland, and emigrated to England, changing his name to Abraham Walters (the original family surname was Warmwasser).[13] Walters' father, Lou, was born in London c. 1896 and moved to New York with his father and two brothers, arriving August 28, 1909. His mother and four sisters arrived in 1910.[14] In 1949 her father opened the New York version of the Latin Quarter. He also worked as a Broadway producer (he produced the Ziegfeld Follies of 1943).[15][16] He also was the Entertainment Director for the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he imported the "Folies Bergere" stage show from Paris to the resort's main showroom.[17] Walters' brother, Burton, died in 1944 of pneumonia.[18] Walters' elder sister, Jacqueline, was born mentally disabled[19] and died of ovarian cancer in 1985.
According to Walters, her father made and lost several fortunes throughout his life in show business. He was a booking agent, and unlike her uncles who were in the shoe and dress business, his job was not very safe. During the good times, Walters recalls her father taking her to the rehearsals of the night club shows he directed and produced. The actresses and dancers would make a huge fuss over her and twirl her around until she was dizzy. Then she said her father would take her out for hot dogs, their favorite.[20]
According to Walters, being surrounded by celebrities when she was young kept her from being "in awe" of them.[19] When she was a young woman, Walters' father lost his night clubs and the family's penthouse on Central Park West. As Walters recalled, "He had a breakdown. He went down to live in our house in Florida, and then the Government took the house, and they took the car, and they took the furniture." Of her mother, she said, "My mother should have married the way her friends did, to a man who was a doctor or who was in the dress business."[21]
Walters attended Lawrence School, a public school in Brookline, Massachusetts, to the middle of fifth grade, when her father moved the family to Miami Beach in 1939, where she also attended public school. After her father moved the family to New York City, she went to eighth grade at Ethical Culture Fieldston School, after which the family moved back to Miami Beach. Then, back to New York City, and for high school, Birch Wathen School[22][23] from which she graduated in 1947. In 1951 she received a B.A. in English from Sarah Lawrence College[24] and immediately looked for work in New York City. After about a year at a small advertising agency, she began working at the NBC network affiliate in New York City, WNBT-TV (now WNBC), doing publicity and writing press releases. She began producing a 15-minute children's program, "Ask the Camera," directed by Roone Arledge in 1953. She then produced for TV host, Igor Cassini/Cholly Knickerbocker, but left the network due to pressure from her boss to marry him, and his fist-fight with a man she preferred to date. Then she went to WPIX to produce the "Eloise McElhone Show."; it was cancelled in 1954. She became a writer on "The Morning Show" at CBS in 1955.
After a few years as a publicist with Tex McCrary Inc. and a job as a writer at Redbook magazine, Walters joined NBC's The Today Show as a writer and researcher in 1961.[19] She moved up to become that show's regular "Today Girl", handling lighter assignments and the weather. In her autobiography, she describes this era before the Women's Movement as a time when it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting "hard news". Previous "Today Girls" (whom Walters called "tea pourers") included Florence Henderson, Helen O'Connell, Estelle Parsons and Lee Meriwether.[25] Within a year she had become a reporter-at-large developing, writing, and editing her own reports and interviews. One very well received film segment was "A Day in the Life of a Novice Nun," edited by then first assistant film editor Donald Swerdlow (now Don Canaan) who was subsequently promoted to become a full film editor at NBC News.[19] She had a great relationship with host Hugh Downs for years. When Frank McGee was named host, he refused to do joint interviews with Walters unless he was given the first three questions. She was not named co-host of the show until McGee's death in 1974, when NBC officially designated Walters as the program's first female co-host.
Walters has seldom minced words when describing the visible, on-the-air disdain her co-anchor, Harry Reasoner displayed for her when she was teamed up with him on the ABC Evening News in 1976–78. Reasoner had a difficult relationship with Walters because he disliked having a co-anchor, even though he worked with former CBS colleague Howard K. Smith nightly on ABC for several years. In 1981, five years after the start of their short-lived ABC partnership and well after Reasoner returned to CBS News, Walters and her former co-anchor had a memorable (and cordial) 20/20 interview on the occasion of Reasoner's new book release.[citation needed]
Walters is also known for her years on the ABC newsmagazine 20/20 where she reunited with former Today Show host Hugh Downs in 1979.[19] Throughout her career at ABC, Walters has appeared on ABC news specials as a commentator, including presidential inaugurations and the coverage of 9/11. She was also chosen to be the moderator for the third and final debate between candidates Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, held on the campus of the College of William and Mary at Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the 1976 Presidential Election.[26] In 1984, she moderated a Presidential debate held at the Dana Center for the Humanities at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire.[27] Many of her regular and special programs are syndicated around the world.
Walters is known for "personality journalism" and her "scoop" interviews.[19] In November 1977, she achieved a joint interview with Egypt's President, Anwar Al Sadat, and Israel's Prime Minister, Menachem Begin. According to the New York Times, when she went mano a mano with Walter Cronkite to interview both world leaders, at the end of Cronkite’s interview he is clearly heard saying: “Did Barbara get anything I didn’t get?” [28] Her interviews with world leaders from all walks of life are a chronicle of the latter part of the 20th century.[19] They include the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the Empress Farah Pahlavi; Russia's Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin; China's Jiang Zemin; the UK's Margaret Thatcher; Cuba's Fidel Castro, as well as India's Indira Gandhi, Czechoslovakia's Václav Havel, Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi, King Hussein of Jordan, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Venezuelan President, and Hugo Chavez, among many others Other interviews with influential people include pop icon Michael Jackson, actress Katharine Hepburn, Vogue editor Anna Wintour, and in 1980 Sir Laurence Olivier. Walters considered Robert Smithdas, a deaf-blind man who spent his life improving the life of other individuals who are deaf-blind, as her most inspirational interview.
Walters was widely lampooned for asking actress Katharine Hepburn, "If you were a tree, what kind would you be?" On her last 20/20 television episode, Walters showed video of the Hepburn interview, showing the actress saying that she would like to be a tree. Walters merely followed up with the question, "What kind of a tree?",[19][29] and Hepburn responded "an oak" because they are strong and pretty. According to Walters, for years Hepburn refused her requests for an interview. And when she finally agreed to one, she said she wanted to meet her first. Walters walked in all smiles and ready to please, while Hepburn was at the top of the stairs and barked, “You're late. Have you brought me chocolates?” Walters hadn’t, but said she never showed up without them from then on. They had several other meetings since that first time, mostly in Hepburn’s living room where she would give Walters her opinions. Careers and marriage did not mix. Children and careers were out of the question. Walters said Hepburn’s opinions stuck with her so much, she could repeat them almost verbatim to this day.[20]
During her television special about Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, that aired on ABC-TV on June 9, 1977, Walters claimed that "for Castro, freedom begins with education[citation needed]." Although the films of her two days of interviewing Castro in Cuba showed his personality, in part, as freewheeling, charming, and humorous,[30] she pointedly said to him, "You allow no dissent. Your newspapers, radio, television, motions picture are under state control." To this he replied, "Barbara, our concept of freedom of the press is not yours. If you asked us if a newspaper could appear here against socialism, I can say honestly no, it cannot appear. It would not be allowed by the party, the government, or the people. In that sense we do not have the freedom of the press that you possess in the U.S. And we are very satisfied about that."[31] She concluded the broadcast of the interview by remarking, "What we disagreed on most profoundly is the meaning of freedom—and that is what truly separates us."[32] At the time, Walters kept quiet about seeing New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, pitcher Whitey Ford, and several coaches in Cuba, there to assist Cuban ballplayers.
On March 3, 1999, her interview of Monica Lewinsky was seen by a record 74 million viewers, the highest rating ever for a news program.[33] Walters asked Lewinsky, "What will you tell your children when you have them?" Lewinsky replied, "Mommy made a big mistake," at which point Walters brought the program to a dramatic conclusion, turning to the viewers and saying, "And that is the understatement of the year."[34]
The View's panel (left–right Whoopi Goldberg, Barbara Walters, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd and Elisabeth Hasselbeck) interview United States President Barack Obama on July 29, 2010.
Walters was a part-time host of the daytime talk show The View, of which she also is co-creator and co-executive producer with her business partner, Bill Geddie.[19] Walters described the show in its original opening credits as a forum for women of "different generations, backgrounds, and views." She added, "Be careful what you wish for..." The show's current co-hosts are Whoopi Goldberg, Jenny McCarthy, and Sherri Shepherd.[35] Previous co-hosts include Joy Behar (1997–2013), Elisabeth Hasselbeck (2003–2013), Meredith Vieira (1997–2006), Star Jones (1997–2006), Lisa Ling (1999–2002), Rosie O'Donnell (2006–2007), and Debbie Matenopoulos (1997–1999). Walters retired from being a co-host May 2014.
As of 2004, Walters was in semi-retirement as a broadcast journalist, but remained a correspondent for ABC News as well as a host of ABC's special programs, while continuing to co-host The View. On March 7, 2010, Barbara Walters announced she would no longer hold Oscar interviews, but will still be working with ABC and on The View.[36]
In a November 2010 episode of The View, while interviewing Larry King on his retirement from CNN, Walters alluded to her impending retirement, stating, "I know when my time's coming."
On March 28, 2013, numerous media outlets reported that Barbara Walters would retire in May 2014 and that she would make the announcement on the show four days later.[37][38][39][40] However, on the April 1 episode, Walters neither confirmed nor denied the retirement rumors; she said "if and when I might have an announcement to make, I will do it on this program, I promise, and the paparazzi guys -- you will be the last to know".[41][42] Walters confirmed six weeks later that she will be retiring from television hosting and interviewing in May 2014, as originally reported; she made the official announcement on the May 13, 2013, episode of The View while also announcing that she will continue as the show's executive producer for as long as it's on the air.[43][44][45][46][47]
Walters has been married four times to three different men. Her first husband was Robert Henry Katz, a business executive and former Navy lieutenant. They married on June 20, 1955, at The Plaza Hotel in New York City.[2][48] The marriage was reportedly annulled after 11 months,[49] or in 1957.[50]
Her second husband was Lee Guber, theatrical producer and theater owner. They married on December 8, 1963, and divorced in 1976. They have one daughter, Jacqueline Dena Guber (born 1968, adopted the same year).
Her third husband was Merv Adelson, the CEO of Lorimar Television. They married in 1981, divorced in 1984, remarried on May 10, 1986, and divorced again in 1992.[citation needed]
She dated gay lawyer[51][52] Roy Cohn in college; he said that he proposed marriage to Walters the night before her wedding to Lee Guber, but Walters denied this.[18] She explained her lifelong devotion to Cohn as gratitude for his help in her adoption of her daughter, Jacqueline.[53] In her autobiography, Walters says that Cohn got her father's warrant for "failure to appear" dismissed.[54]
Walters dated future U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the 1970s[55] and was linked romantically to United States Senator John Warner in the 1990s.[56]
In Walters' autobiography Audition, she claimed that she had an affair in the 1970s with Edward Brooke, then a married United States Senator from Massachusetts. It is not clear whether Walters also was married at the time. Walters said they ended the affair to protect their careers from scandal.[dead link][57] In 2007 she dated Pulitzer Prize-winning gerontologist Robert Neil Butler.[58]
She announced on the May 10, 2010, episode of The View that she would be undergoing open heart surgery to replace a faulty aortic valve. Walters added that she knew for quite a while that she was suffering from aortic valve stenosis, even though she was symptom-free. The procedure to fix the faulty heart valve "went well, and the doctors are very pleased with the outcome," Walters' spokeswoman, Cindi Berger, said in a statement on May 14, 2010.[60]
On July 9, 2010, it was announced that Walters would return to The View and her Sirius XM satellite show, Here's Barbara, in September 2010.[61][62]
Barbara Walters was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1989. On June 15, 2007, Walters received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She has won Daytime and Prime Time Emmy Awards, a Women in Film Lucy Award, and a GLAAD Excellence in Media award. Her impact on the popular culture is illustrated by Gilda Radner's "Baba Wawa" impersonation of her on Saturday Night Live,[19] featuring her idiosyncratic speech with its rounded "R". In 2008, she was honored with the Disney Legends award, an award given to those who made an outstanding contribution to The Walt Disney Company, which owns the network ABC. That same year, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York Women's Agenda. On September 21, 2009, Walters was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 30th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards at New York City's Lincoln Center.
2009 Award for Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host (The View) (with Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Sherri Shepherd)
1998 Lucy Award in recognition of her excellence and innovation in her creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television.[64]
In the late 1960s Walters wrote a magazine article, "How to Talk to Practically Anyone About Practically Anything", which drew upon the kinds of things people said to her, which were often mistakes.[65] Shortly after the article appeared, she received a letter from Doubleday expressing interest in expanding it into a book. Walters felt that it would help "tongue-tied, socially awkward people — the many people who worry that they can't think of the right thing to say to start a conversation."[65] She published the book How to Talk with Practically Anybody about Practically Anything in 1970, with the assistance of ghostwriter June Callwood.[66] To Walters' great surprise, the book was a phenomenon. As of 2008, it had gone through eight printings, sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, and had been translated into at least six different languages.[65]

      First ever female to anchor a news broadcast on a major network when she and Harry Reasoner were co-anchors on ABC Evening News (1953) in 1976.
      In mid 2003, country singer Brad Paisley released a single titled "Celebrity," which he makes a reference to Barbara by saying "I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters when things don't go my way" referring to the celebrities who she interviews, the song turned out to be a major country radio hit.

      I was the kind nobody thought could make it. I had a funny Boston accent. I couldn't pronounce my R's. I wasn't a beauty.
      [on interviewing] I find very often people like to confront rumors. It depends on how much they trust you. And you have to have a line between what is tasteful and what isn't.
      My own opinion is that there's far too little flirtation in our country as it is. Most attractive males talk to most attractive women as if they were Rotarians comparing sales percentages in Des Moines.

Barbara Walters arguably has interviewed more statesmen and stars than any other journalist in history. She is so well-known that her name and a brief biography are listed in the American Heritage Dictionary.
This season, "The View" executive producer and co-host Ms. Walters begins her farewell season on the daytime show she created and celebrates her final year on broadcast television. Her unparalleled career began in 1961 as a writer and on-the-air reporter for the "Today Show." In marking her historic career, the show’s producers have promised a year-long series fit for a true television icon.
In September 2004, after 25 years as co-host and chief correspondent of ABC News' "20/20," Ms. Walters left the show to begin a new phase in her career at the network. She remains an active member of the news division and network, substantially increasing the number of primetime ABC News specials, in addition to her "Barbara Walters Specials." Ms. Walters joined ABC News in 1976 as the first woman to co-host the network news.
In her final season, Barbara Walters' "20/20" newsmaker exclusives included the coveted first interview with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton regarding her highly-anticipated autobiography; the first with Martha Stewart before her trial and than again immediately following sentencing; traveling to Cuba to interview President Fidel Castro 25 years after their first headline-making interview; Former Vice President Al Gore in his first formal interview since the controversial 2000 Presidential election; President and Mrs. Bush, who gave "20/20" the first look at the White House at Christmas; a candid conversation with media phenoms, The Osbournes; and actor Robert Blake, who spoke out for the first time since being arrested for the murder of his wife. Walters also tackled tough issues surrounding the war with Iraq, including reports on Iraqi women and children who lived through the first Persian Gulf war and now live in America.
Through the years she has interviewed such world figures as Russia's Boris Yeltsin, China's Premier Jiang Zemin, Great Britain's former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Libya's Moammar Qadaffi and Iraq's President Sadaam Hussein. She was also the first American journalist to interview Russia's President Vladimir Putin and the first interview with President and Mrs. Bush following September 11. In December 2011, she conducted an exclusive interview with Syria’s embattled President, Bashir al Assad in Damascus.
At the other extreme, in 1999 Ms. Walters conducted the first interview with Monica Lewinsky, which became the highest-rated news program ever broadcast by a single network.
She has interviewed every American President and First Lady since Richard Nixon. She made journalism history by arranging the first joint interview with Egypt's President Anwar Sadat and Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin in November, 1977. Another of her "firsts" was an hour-long primetime conversation with Cuban President Fidel Castro -- an interview which has been printed in half a dozen languages and shown all over the world.
"The Barbara Walters Specials" are continuously the top-rated specials of the year and have included such legends as Sir Laurence Olivier, Bing Crosby, John Wayne, Bette Davis and Audrey Hepburn and have included such superstars as Simon Cowell, Betty White, Katy Perry, Harrison Ford, David and Victoria Beckham, Justin Timberlake and George Clooney.

    Barbara Walters b. 1931 BibliographyDiscuss Full imageBarbara Walters has probably interviewed more statesmen and stars than any other journalist in history. Her numerous and timely TV interviews, both on the weekly newsmagazine 20/20 and on The Barbara Walters Specials, read like a "Who's Who" of newsmakers.Institution: Private collection  by Kathleen Thompson 
“She is like the autumn cherry tree,” said Time magazine in 1995, “in full flower.” When a hard-edged news magazine waxes this lyrical about a woman, one would expect her to be a movie star. In this case, the object of the admiration is a journalist with a reputation for integrity, professionalism, and, at times, unscrupulous competitiveness. But then, Barbara Walters has always elicited extreme responses.
Barbara Walters was born on September 25, 1931, in Boston, to Louis Edward and Dena (Selett) Walters, and grew up in Boston, Miami and New York City. Her father, known as Lew, was a well-known nightclub owner whose life was filled with celebrities, excitement and financial success. She had two older siblings, a sister, Jacqueline, who was developmentally disabled, and a brother, Burton, who died of pneumonia at a young age. Barbara attended both public and private schools, completing the Miami Beach Senior High School in 1949 before attending Sarah Lawrence College, from which she graduated in 1953 with a bachelor’s degree in English. “Until I was about twenty-three or twenty-four,” she told interviewer Tabitha Soren in 1996, “we were very rich. I can go around New York and show you all the penthouses we lived in. And then in my later twenties it was all gone.” From that point on, Walters focused on supporting herself and helping to take care of her family.
Walters worked briefly for a New York advertising agency before taking her first position in television. She began not as a broadcaster but as assistant to the publicity director for the NBC-affiliated television station in New York City. She was soon the youngest person ever to become a producer at the station. After going from there to another local station, she joined the CBS network staff as a news and public affairs producer and as a writer. 
Walters took a break from television to work for a theatrical public relations firm, but she was back in broadcasting by 1961. Working as a writer for NBC’s successful morning show Today, she began for the first time to make occasional appearances on the air. These feature-story appearances led to an opportunity to try out as the “Today Girl.” Walters took the role of the pretty, smiling small-talker and turned it into an essential part of the program. Before long she was reading news and acting as a commentator. She also worked in the field, going in 1972 to China as part of the NBC News team covering President Richard Nixon’s historic visit.
It was at Today that Walters began doing interviews, an area of broadcasting that would become her specialty. Her interviews with such eminent figures as Golda Meir, Robert Kennedy, and Coretta Scott King led to a reputation as a serious interviewer of serious people. 
Walters’s professionalism—along with her remarkable intelligence and presence—elicited a powerful response from audiences. In 1974, she became the show’s cohost, working beside veteran Hugh Downs. In 1975, she won an Emmy for her work on the show. She also acquired her own syndicated talk show, Not for Women Only. This spectacular rise peaked in 1976 when she became the first woman to cohost a new network show—the ABC Evening News. So convinced were they that Walters was the woman for the job, the network offered her a record-breaking million-dollar annual salary and a five-year contract. It made her the highest-paid journalist, male or female, up to that time. That fact was trumpeted in the press, and Walters was suddenly a bigger celebrity than many of the people she interviewed.
This particular triumph, however, did not last. Her cohost, Harry Reasoner, did not cooperate. “Harry did not want a partner,” Walters says. “It was very painful. Definitely the worst year of my life.” Only a year and a half after she took the job, she was out of the anchor desk—but not off the air. The highest-paid journalist in history fulfilled her contract with ABC by producing her own television specials.
Under attack in the press as a five-million-dollar bomb, Walters suffered considerable anguish, but the disaster led to even greater success. Her interviewing skills made The Barbara Walters Specials legendary. According to broadcaster Mike Wallace, a friend and rival, “She’s the best damn interviewer in the business. It’s taken all this time to perfect her craft, and she never stopped working at it. Everything she has invested—the phone calls, the contacts, the letters, the knowledge—has paid off. For a long time, people didn’t understand what a good journalist she is.”
Walters herself had doubts after the conflict with Reasoner, and her work in the 1970s reflected it. “There was a long time when I was working my way back from the tough times in the ’70s and I felt I had to prove myself journalistically.” During that time Walters developed a reputation for stealing interviews and fawning over celebrities. Certainly she has been intensely competitive. Once, Diane Sawyer was set to interview Katharine Hepburn when Walters reportedly called to say, “Strike the lights, turn off the cameras. I’ll be right there to do it myself.” It is impossible to say, however, how much of the resentment was due to Walters’s personality and how much to her success.
In any case, Walters earned the respect of those celebrities and political figures everyone in journalism wanted to interview. She was able to obtain one exclusive interview after another. Princess Grace of Monaco agreed to talk to Walters, as did Henry Kissinger. She conversed on the air with Prince Philip, Fred Astaire, and Mamie Eisenhower. She has interviewed every president since Richard Nixon and every first lady since Lady Bird Johnson. In 1977, she arranged the first joint interviews with President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel. She also interviewed President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
In 1982 and 1983, Walters won Emmy awards for her interviewing. In 1984, she was back on a regularly scheduled show. With old friend and cohost Hugh Downs, she helped to develop one of the first, and still one of the best, investigative news shows, 20/20. 
Personally, Walters has sometimes suffered for her success. After two divorces and an annulment, she is now happily unmarried. Her relationship with her adopted daughter, Jacqueline Dena Guber (b. June 14, 1968), has survived many difficult and painful times. She reminded USA Weekend interviewer Tabitha Soren that the world was very different when her daughter was growing up. “There were women leaving their husbands and children because they had to fulfill themselves. It’s no longer like that. Joan Lunden or Katie Couric can bring her kids to work. [If I’d brought my baby] into the studios, people would have looked at me like I was bringing in a puppy that wasn’t housebroken.”
Walters has collected virtually all of the broadcasting industry’s highest awards. She received the National Association of Television Program Executives Award and was named the International Radio and Television Society’s Broadcaster of the Year in 1975, the year she received the first of her four Emmy awards (1970, 1980, 1982, 1983). In 1988, she was honored with the President’s Award by the Overseas Press Club and was given a retrospective at the Museum of Broadcasting. In 1990, she was inducted into the Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame and received the Lowell Thomas Award for journalistic excellence. She received the lifetime achievement award of the International Women’s Media Foundation in 1991, and that of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 2000.
In 1994, Walters made the news when another ABC broadcaster, Diane Sawyer, was offered a contract worth an extraordinary seven million dollars a year. As always, Walters was the standard against which any woman journalist was measured. The press immediately reported that Walters made ten million dollars, but that the production costs of her specials cut into that figure. Her agent was soon renegotiating her contract.
As host of the program, Walters helped to keep 20/20 at the top of the newsmagazine shows, in spite of the proliferation of rivals. She won acclaim for her interviews of General Colin Powell and actor/director Christopher Reeve. She also conducted the first interview on American television of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and the first interview with President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, following the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. 
The View, a talk show forum for women’s issues which Walter co-owns, co-produces and co-hosts, premiered in 1997. But she remained as host of 20/20--becoming its sole anchor in 1999—until September 2004. Since then, she has continued to do several ABC News interview specials a year and to host The View. When Walters announced her intention to leave the show, 20/20 was averaging just under ten million viewers a week. 
Hugh Downs explains her success this way: “Barbara has operated on the premise that her first allegiance is to the person tuning in. She represents the viewer and does it without hostility.” From someone who has himself mastered the art of nonconfrontational interviewing, that is praise indeed. And according to Time, Walters often elicits praise from the specialists. “Walters is a terrific editor, say her editors. She is a great writer, say her writers. She is her own best booker, say her producers. She is her own best publicist, say her publicists. She works us hard, but she works harder than we do, they say.”

Barbara Walters attended Sarah Lawrence College, then began her television career as an assistant to the publicity director of RCA-TV.
Walters was chosen to participate in a producer's training program, and later worked for WPIX as a producer of women's programming. She eventually moved to CBS, and then jumped to NBC.
In 1961, Walters became a writer for NBC's 'Today Show', was a regular panel member by 1963, and co-hosted the show from 1974 to 1976.
She joined ABC in 1976 as co-anchor of the network evening news program, the first woman to achieve that position. Also in 1976, Walters began hosting television specials, in which she interviewed world leaders and other celebrities.
Three years later, she became co-host of the ABC news magazine '20/20'. Walters has been awarded a number of Emmys, and was honoured by a career retrospective at the Museum of Broadcasting in 1988.
Walters is known for 'personality journalism' and her 'scoop' interviews, such as the Monica Lewinsky interview that won the highest ratings of any journalist interview.
Her interviews with world leaders from all walks of life are a chronicle of the latter part of the 20th century. They include Russia's Boris Yeltsin, China's Jiang Zemin, Cuba's Fidel Castro and Indira Gandhi of India.
Walters has been married three times. Her former husbands include Robert Henry Katz, a business executive and former Navy lieutenant (1955-1958); Lee Guber, theatrical producer and theater owner (1963-1976) - one daughter, Jacqueline Dena Guber (born 1968); and Merv Adelson, the CEO of Lorimar Television (1986-1992).
