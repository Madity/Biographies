          Academy Award-nominee Woody Harrelson was born on July 23, 1961 in Midland, Texas. He grew up in Lebanon, Ohio, and, after receiving degrees in theater arts and English from Hanover College, had a brief stint in New York theater. He was soon cast as Woody on TV series Cheers (1982), which wound up being one of the most-popular TV shows ever and also earned Harrelson an Emmy for his performance in 1989.While he dabbled in film during his time on Cheers (1982), that area of his career didn't fully take off until towards the end of the show's run. In 1991, Doc Hollywood (1991) gave him his first widely-seen movie role, and he followed that up with White Men Can't Jump (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993) and Natural Born Killers (1994). Recently, Harrelson has been seen in No Country for Old Men (2007), Zombieland (2009), 2012 (2009), and Friends with Benefits (2011), along with the acclaimed HBO movie Game Change (2012).In 2011, Harrelson snagged the coveted role of fan-favorite drunk Haymitch Abernathy in the big-screen adaptation of The Hunger Games (2012), which ended up being one of the highest-grossing movies ever at the domestic box office. Harrelson is set to reprise that role for the sequels, which are scheduled for release in November 2013, 2014 and 2015. Harrelson has received two Academy Award nominations, first for his role as controversial Hustler founder Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and then for a role in The Messenger (2009). He also received Golden Globe nominations for both of these parts.Harrelson was briefly married to Nancy Simon in the 80s, and later married his former assistant, Laura Louie, with whom he has three daughters.
          Woody Harrelson grew up in Lebanon, Ohio. He received degrees in theatre arts and English from Hanover College, Indiana. His career began in New York theatre as an understudy in Neil Simon's "Biloxi Blues". Within months, he was cast as Woody on the hit TV series, Cheers (1982). Due to conflicts with his TV schedule, Harrelson found it difficult to cross-over to films. His first appearance was in Wildcats (1986) with Goldie Hawn.

Meanwhile, he continued to be active in theatre in L.A.: "Zoo Story", "2 on 2" (his own basketball drama), "Brooklyn Laundry" (with Glenn Close and Laura Dern). In 1991, Doc Hollywood (1991) gave him his first widely-seen movie role. The following year, White Men Can't Jump (1992), with Wesley Snipes established him as a box-office draw.

      A jury in Beattyville, Kentucky dismissed a marijuana possession charge against him. He was arrested in 1996 for planting 4 marijuana hemp seeds in rural Kentucky and in his defence he said he was challenging a state law that makes no distinction between marijuana and hemp, even though hemp contains little of the drug found in marijuana and can be used to make a variety of industrial products. [August 2000]
      Woody and approximately a dozen other hemp activists and environmentalists took a bicycle tour down the west coast of America, starting in Seattle, Washington and 1000 miles later ending at the University of Santa Barbara in California.

      When I let up from the weed, and the drinking too, I cried every day. And I liked that. I like crying. And now I not only wanna cry and show my crying to other people, I wanna just split myself down the middle and open my guts and just throw everything out!
      Well for six years during Cheers (1982), I couldn't get another job. So I was getting to the mindset of, 'Wow, so this is it. I thought the career was just starting and apparently it's just over.' Fortunately then, I got a role in Doc Hollywood (1991) and then White Men Can't Jump (1992). Those I was doing during my hiatus from Cheers (1982), and then I did Indecent Proposal (1993) during my last hiatus. And then Indecent Proposal (1993) came out literally the day after we wrapped Cheers (1982). And then I started work on Natural Born Killers (1994). So I was fortunately able to segue, but for awhile I thought, 'Jeez, this is it'. And I felt that I could do so much more. I really wanted to express myself a little more. Not to say that "Woody Boyd" was not a great role!
      It was very interesting. I read that book and I honestly had no idea what the hell was going on. Then I did the movie because I just wanted to do it. I wanted to work with Richard Linklater, Keanu Reeves, 'Robert Downey Jr.' and Winona Ryder. I wanted to do it, but I really still don't know what the hell that film is about. But I just know it's really interesting (On A Scanner Darkly (2006)).
      I never was disillusioned with acting because I love acting. But I just felt at one point that I was on a hamster wheel, you know? Just doing movie after movie and thinking so much about career related things and I think missing out on hanging with my friends and family as much I needed to. So I just took some time off. I was maybe going to do two or three years and it turned into five years. But certainly, I'd say it was the best thing I ever did. And now I come back to this whole thing really energized about it. (2005 quote)
      Most people take it pretty badly and just go crazy - I was no exception. But I feel like I've come out of it with my spirit still intact. (2002 quote on fame)
      I've found that every time you stand up for something and open your mouth, you alienate someone. I spent a lot of time wanting to become rich and famous, then when I got there, I found it was hollow. What is important to me is my connection with family and friends, and to nature, and to stand up for what I believe in. It really makes you feel good to follow through with your convictions. Granted, between opening my mouth and some of the movies I've chosen to do, I've alienated a lot of my fans, I'm sure. Hopefully I'll make better movies, but I'll never stop opening my large, prominent mouth. (1997 quote)
      (On environmental issues) I've been concerned for years. When I was in the seventh grade, I did a report about the environment and the loss of species. It was supposed to be only a few pages, but ended up being nearly 50. I've always had an intense relationship with nature, something which I think all of us have somewhere inside of us. Getting involved environmentally, really stepping out there, happened when I was doing Cheers (1982). Ted Danson couldn't make it to a couple of his meetings with the American Oceans Campaign, and he asked me if I would step in for him.
      I don't think anybody watches a two-hour movie and decides they're going to become a serial killer. (On the furor over whether or not Natural Born Killers provoked a couple of teenagers to commit murder)
      [on a scary moment in Dubrovnik] These guys were coming down from the hillside. They were the toughest-looking motherf***ers you ever saw - some kind of Croatian judo gang or something - and they were coming down basically to kill me for being with these red-hot girls. They were ready to tear me apart, and it got mind-blowingly tense. But then one of these f***ing guys recognises me from American TV, so we end up going out for drinks with them. I swear if I had not been on Cheers (1982), I'd have died right there on that beach in Croatia.
      [on how Paul McCartney got him out of trouble when he attacked a photographer] I was feeling awful about it (the attack), and I ran into Sir Paul McCartney. We've been friends for a long time through our shared passion for veganism and many other issues. He's got such a great capacity for happiness. I told him what happened and also that I'd just finished this movie called Zombieland (2009), and Paul said, 'That's it, man. Just tell the press you thought the cameraman was a zombie.' So that's what we went with.
      I was about 24 years old and I had tons of acne and mucus. I met some random girl on a bus who told me to quit dairy and all those symptoms would go away three days later. By God, she was right!
      I personally get freaked out watching horror films. I liked Shaun of the Dead (2004) because I like horror comedies. But 28 Days Later... (2002)? I was sleepless, man.
      I am not loving Obama - he made this statement when they were talking about trying to accomplish with the new legislation about global warming and he said "Let's not let great be the enemy of good." That just stayed with me and haunted me. "Great be the enemy of good" - let's not make great, firm international legislation and try to settle for what we can get. Lyndon Johnson probably would have said that.
      [on the arrest of Roman Polanski] I have a daughter who is 13 and the thought of some guy giving her a Quaalude...then I was torn over the fact that it had been 32 years and the girl had forgiven him, so I don't know. I do think that what he did was wrong.
      [on his daughter going to college] It was one of the single most difficult experiences of my life when it was time to separate and she walked off to the dorm and we drove away. I bawled my eyes out.
      I was in a taxi the other night, and we started talking about life and the taxi driver goes, "Chaos and creativity go together. If you lose one per cent of your chaos, you lose your creativity." I said that's the most brilliant thing I've heard. I needed to hear that years ago.

He told Playboy in October 2009, "I was getting into theology and studying the roots of the Bible, but then I started to discover the man-made nature of it. I started seeing things that made me ask, 'Is God really speaking through this instrument?' ... My eyes opened to the reality of the Bible being just a document to control people. At the time I was a real mama's boy and deeply mesmerized by the church."[6]
Harrelson is widely known for his work on the NBC sitcom Cheers. He played bartender Woody Boyd, who replaced Coach (played by Nicholas Colasanto, who died in February 1985).

"I had acne all over my face, which I'd had for years and years. And she's like: 'Hey, you're lactose intolerant. If you quit dairy, all these symptoms you got will be gone in three days.' I was like twenty-four. And I was like, No way. But three days later: gone."[25]

=======================================================
From All Movie Guide: Known almost as much for his off-screen pastimes as his on-screen characterizations, Woody Harrelson is an actor for whom truth is undeniably stranger than fiction. Son of a convicted murderer, veteran of multiple arrests, outspoken environmentalist, and tireless hemp proponent, Harrelson is colorful even by Hollywood standards. However, he is also a strong, versatile actor, something that tends to be obscured by the attention paid to his real-life antics. Born in Midland, TX, on July 23, 1961, Harrelson grew up in Lebanon, OH. He began his acting career there, appearing in high-school plays. He also went professional around this time, making his small-screen debut in Harper Valley P.T.A. (1978) alongside Barbara Eden. While studying acting in earnest, Harrelson attended Indiana's Hanover College; following his graduation, he had his first speaking part (one line only) in the 1986 Goldie Hawn vehicle Wildcats. On the stage, Harrelson understudied in the Neil Simon Broadway comedy Biloxi Blues (he was briefly married to Simon's daughter Nancy) and at one point wrote a play titled Furthest From the Sun. His big break came in 1985, when he was cast as the sweet-natured, ingenuous bartender Woody Boyd on the TV sitcom Cheers. To many, he is best remembered for this role, for which he won a 1988 Emmy and played until the series' 1993 conclusion. During his time on Cheers, Harrelson also played more serious roles in made-for-TV movies such as Bay Coven (1987), and branched out to the big screen with roles in such films as Casualties of War (1989) and Doc Hollywood (1991). Harrelson's big break as a movie star came with Ron Shelton's 1992 sleeper White Men Can't Jump, a buddy picture in which he played a charming (if profane) L.A. hustler. His next film was a more serious drama, Indecent Proposal (1993), wherein he was miscast as a husband whose wife sleeps with a millionaire in exchange for a fortune. In 1994, Harrelson appeared as an irresponsible rodeo rider in the moronic buddy comedy The Cowboy Way, which proved to be an all-out clinker. That film's failings, however, were more than overshadowed by his other film that year, Oliver Stone's inflammatory Natural Born Killers. Playing one of the film's titular psychopaths, Harrelson earned both raves and a sizable helping of controversy for his complex performance. Following work in a couple of low-rated films, Harrelson again proved his mettle, offering another multi-layered performance as real life pornography magnate Larry Flynt in the controversial People Vs. Larry Flynt (1996). The performance earned Harrelson an Oscar nomination. The next year, he earned further praise for his portrayal of a psychotic military prisoner in Wag the Dog. He then appeared as part of an all-star lineup in Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line (1998), and in 1999 gave a hilarious performance as Matthew McConaughey's meathead brother in EdTV. That same year, he lent his voice to one of his more passionate causes, acting as the narrator for Grass, a documentary about marijuana.     In 2000, Harrelson starred in White Men collaborator Ron Shelton's boxing drama Play It to the Bone as an aspiring boxer who travels to Las Vegas to find fame and fortune, but ends up competing against his best friend (Antonio Banderas). The actor temporarily retired from the big screen in 2001 and harkened back to his television roots, with seven appearances as Natha, the short-term downstairs boyfriend to Debra Messing's Grace, in producer David Kohan's long-running hit Will and Grace (1998-2006). After his return to television, Harrelson seemed content to land supporting roles for several years. He reemerged in cineplexes with twin 2003 releases. In that year's little-seen Scorched, an absurdist farce co-starring John Cleese and Alicia Silverstone, Harrelson plays an environmentalist and animal activist who seeks retribution on Cleese's con-man for the death of one of his pet ducks. Unsurprisingly, most American critics didn't even bother reviewing the film, and it saw extremely limited release. Harrelson contributed a cameo to the same year's Jack Nicholson/Adam Sandler vehicle Anger Mangement, and a supporting role to 2004's critically-panned Spike Lee opus She Hate Me. The tepid response to these films mirrored those directed at After the Sunset (2004), Brett Ratner's homage to Alfred Hitchcock. Harrelson stars in the diamond heist picture as federal agent Stan Lloyd, opposite Pierce Brosnan's master thief Max Burdett. Audiences had three chances to catch Harrelson through the end of 2005; these included Mark Mylod's barely-released, Fargo-esque crime comedy The Big White , with Robin Williams and Holly Hunter; Niki Caro's October 2005 sexual harrassment docudrama North Country, starring Charlize Theron; and the gifted Jane Anderson's period drama Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio. In the latter, Harrelson plays, Leo 'Kelly' Ryan, the drunken, increasingly violent husband of lead Julianne Moore, who manages to hold her family together with a steady stream of sweepstakes wins in the mid-fifties, as alcoholism and the financial burden of ten children threaten to either tear the family apart or send it skidding into abject poverty. Harrelson then joined the cast of maestro auteur Robert Altman's ensemble comedy-drama A Prairie Home Companion (2006), a valentine to Garrison Keillor's decades-old radio program with a strong ensemble cast that includes Meryl Streep, Lindsay Lohan and Kevin Kline. He also works wonders as a key contributor to the same year's Richard Linklater sci-fi thriller Through a Scanner Darkly, an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's 1977 novel that, like one of the director's previous efforts, 2001's Waking Life, uses rotoscoping to animate over live-action footage. It opened in July 2006 to uniformly strong reviews. As Ernie Luckman, one of the junkie hangers-on at Robert Arctor's (Keanu Reeves) home, Harrelson contributes an effective level of despondency to his character, amid a first-rate cast. After Harrelson shot Prairie and Scanner, the trades announced that he had signed up to star in Paul Schrader's first UK-produced feature, Walker, to co-star Kristin Scott-Thomas, Lauren Bacall, Ned Beatty, Lily Tomlin and Willem Dafoe. Harrelson portrays the lead, a Washington, D.C.-based female escort; Schrader informed the trades that he envisions the character as something similar to what American Gigolo's Julian Kaye would become in middle-age. Shooting began in March 2006. He also signed on, in June of the same year, to join the cast of the Coen Bros.' 2007 release No Country for Old Men, which would capture the Academy Award for Best Picture. Harrelson showed off his versatility in 2008 by starring in the Will Ferrell basketball comedy Semi-Pro as well as the thriller Transsiberian. He continued to prove himself capable of just about any part the next year with his entertaining turn in the horror comedy Zombieland, and his powerful work as a damaged soldier in Oren Moverman's directorial debut The Messenger. For his work in that movie, Harrelson captured his second Academy Award nomination, as well as nods from the Golden Globes, the Independent Spirit Awards, and the Screen Actors Guild - in addition to winning the Best Supporting Actor award from the National Board of Review. In 2012, the actor appeared as the flawed but loyal mentor to two young adults forced to compete to the death in the film adaptation of author Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi

Born Woodrow Tracy Harrelson in Midland, Texas, Harrelson had a childhood unlike most other people. His father, Charles Voyde Harrelson, went to prison for life, convicted of murder when Harrelson was only seven. His mother, Diane, a legal secretary, raised her three sons in Lebanon, Ohio. After obtaining an English and theatrical arts degree in 1983 from Hanover College, Indiana, Harrelson went to New York City to pursue a career in acting.  
He began as an understudy in Neil Simon's Biloxi Blues. Within months, he was cast as the good-hearted but dim-witted bartender Woody Boyd on the hit TV series, Cheers. He was nominated for an Emmy five times and won in 1988 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. 
Harrelson's movie career took off with 1992's White Men Can't Jump, and although he seemed miscast in 1993's Indecent Proposal, the film was a major hit. With Oliver Stone's contoversial Natural Born Killers, Harrelson received high artistic praise as well as social condemnation and it allowed audiences to view him in a completely new light. 
In his Oscar-nominated role as Hustler magazine founder Larry Flynt in the 1996 biopic The People vs. Larry Flynt, critics no longer dismissed Harrelson as a light-weight actor. In 1999, Harrelson, a vegan, received another Emmy nomination for reprising the role of Woody Boyd in a guest appearance on Frasier. In 2003 he won an Honorary Maverick Award at the Woodstock Film Festival for his independence regarding art and politics. He received his second Academy Award nomination in 2010, for his work in The Messenger (2009). Harrelson can most recently be seen playing the role of Haymitch Abernathy in the highly-anticipated film adaptation of Suzanne Collins' bestselling book The Hunger Games (2012).
In 1998, he and longtime love Laura Louie were married in a private ceremony in Costa Rica. Laura, formerly Harrelson's assistant, had worked with him for more than two years before they became romantically involved in 1990. Laura is currently a partner in their production company, Children at Play, and in their health food restaurant/oxygen bar in Los Angeles. Together they have three daughters: Deni Montana, Zoe Giordano and Makani Ravello.

“I do smoke, but I don't go through all this trouble just because I want to make my drug of choice legal. It's about personal freedom. We should have the right in this country to do what we want, if we don't hurt anybody.” - Woody Harrelson
                Woody Harrelson may just be the most ambitious pothead in America. Despite his well-known proclivity for recreational narcotics, this 48-year-old leading man has managed to spearhead national campaigns to abolish clear cutting, demystify veganism and legalize marijuana. He’s also found time to do a little acting, with appearances in more than 60 films and television productions. His latest role in The Messenger (2009) has earned him his second Oscar nomination. “I think I may be prouder of [this film] than anything I’ve been associated with,” he says. “It’s a very touching and powerful project, and what’s interesting is that it’s a war movie completely set in America.”            
                Woody Harrelson has always had a weakness for women -- and women, it seems, have always had a weakness for him. A recovering sex addict, he took full advantage of his fame during the early-to-mid '80s by bedding an endless succession of gorgeous gals. “I was monumentally lucky,” he admits. “Girls would come up to me in bars and say: ‘You want to take a walk on the wild side?’ And we’d just go into the bathroom. Crazy sh*t.” He eventually got his addiction under control and has been with the same woman, Laura Louie, since 1987. The couple now lives on Maui with their three daughters Deni Montana, Zoe Giordano and Makani Ravello. “Me loving Laura as much as I do has led to all the greatest things in my life,” he says. “Laura’s an amazing gal.”            
                Woody Harrelson is quickly becoming America’s most versatile actor. Since getting his big break as dimwitted bartender Woody Boyd in 1985, this cagey star has convincingly played everything from a murderous psychopath to a crippled porn magnate to a lasso-wielding cowboy. And he’s done it with panache, infusing all of his characters with an authenticity seldom seen in American cinema. It’s little wonder then that he’s been nominated for a pair of Oscars and Golden Globes and has won an Emmy, an American Comedy Award, an MTV Movie Award, and an NBR from The National Board of Review.  His accomplishments are especially impressive in light of the fact that acting has never been his top priority. “What is important to me is my connection with family and friends, and to nature, and to stand up for what I believe in,” he says, hinting at his many causes and crusades. “It really makes you feel good to follow through with your convictions. Hopefully I'll make better movies, but I'll never stop opening my large, prominent mouth.” As huge fans of his impressive oeuvre, we hope that’s a promise he intends to keep.            
                Woody Harrelson can be forgiven for being a little bit different. After all, this Midland, Texas, native is the son of a contract killer who once murdered a federal judge. Fortunately, Harrelson was removed from his father’s criminal influence in 1964 when his parents divorced and his mother moved Woody and his two brothers to the sleepy town of Lebanon, Ohio. It was there that Harrelson first discovered a passion for drama and he starred in numerous high school plays before graduating from Indiana’s Hanover College in 1983 with a degree in English and theater arts. woody harrelson is cast in cheers Woody Harrelson wasted little time in abandoning Indiana for the bright lights of New York City, where he auditioned feverishly and briefly worked as an understudy in a Broadway production of Biloxi Blues. His hard work paid off in 1985, when he was cast as bumbling bartender Woody Boyd in Cheers. The role transformed him into an overnight sensation and he was nominated for a pair of Emmy Awards for Best Supporting Actor in 1987 and 1988 before finally winning the honor in 1989.  Harrelson cashed in on his new-found notoriety in 1991 with roles in the big screen comedies Doc Hollywood and Ted & Venus. He then graduated to leading man the following year when he starred in White Men Can’t Jump, a comedy about a pair of interracial basketball hustlers. The film grossed a respectable $90 million at the box office and earned Harrelson and his costar, Wesley Snipes, a pair of nominations from the MTV Movie Awards.  By the time Cheers filmed its final episode in 1993, Harrelson had been nominated for two more Emmy Awards and was well on his way to becoming a major box office draw. woody harrelson earns his first oscar nomination Woody Harrelson picked up right where he left off in 1994 with starring roles in three films including I’ll Do Anything, The Cowboy Way and Natural Born Killers. Although the first two films received little attention, Natural Born Killers became an international phenomenon, thanks to its use of gratuitous violence and its biting condemnation of mass media. Harrelson returned to more standard fare over the next two years in the entertaining buddy comedies Money Train (1995) and Kingpin (1996) before breaking the mold yet again in 1996 as the titular porn magnate in The People vs. Larry Flynt. The provocative film was a huge hit with critics and earned Harrelson his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. woody harrelson shows off his versatility Woody Harrelson rounded out the decade with performances in a dizzying array of films. He played an emotionally disturbed military prisoner in Wag the Dog (1997), an unlucky ex-con in Palmetto (1998), a battle-hardened sergeant in The Thin Red Line (1998), an opportunistic screw-up in Edtv (1999) and an aging boxer in Play it to the Bone (1999). He also picked up his sixth Emmy Award nomination in 1999 after reuniting with his Cheers cast mate Kelsey Grammer for a hilarious episode of Frasier. In fact, Harrelson enjoyed his brief return to the small screen so much that he signed on to play Debra Messing’s boyfriend, Nathan, in seven episodes of Will and Grace in 2001. woody harrelson appears in anger management and north country Woody Harrelson returned to the silver screen in 2003 with a supporting role in Anger Management opposite Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson. The outrageous comedy grossed over $195 million at the box office and led to subsequent supporting roles in 2005 in the award-winning dramas North Country starring Charlize Theron and The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio featuring Julianne Moore. woody harrelson earns his second oscar nomination Woody Harrelson has continued to show off his versatility in recent years by playing a lasso-swinging cowboy in A Prairie Home Companion (2006), an ambitionless junkie in A Scanner Darkly (2006), a prim male escort in The Walker (2007), a washed-up basketball player in Semi-Pro (2008), a blind piano player in Seven Pounds (2008), a bounty hunter in No Country for Old Men (2007), and an enthusiastic slayer of the undead in the surprise hit Zombieland (2009).  As impressive as those roles were, many pundits believe Harrelson turned in his best performance to date in The Messenger, a shrewdly perceptive film about a pair of American soldiers assigned to the Army’s Casualty Notification service. Hailed by The New Yorker as “a fully felt, morally alert, marvelously acted piece of work,” The Messenger has earned Harrelson nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role from the Academy Awards, The Golden Globes, The Independent Spirit Awards, the Satellite Awards, and The National Board of Review. looking ahead Harrelson is currently working on two new films including the drama Bunraku starring Josh Hartnett, and the fantasy flick The Other Side, featuring Jason Lee. Rumor has it he has also signed on to star in a sequel to Zombieland. The eagerly anticipated film is currently in development.

"My primary concern is always the humanism of the characters. Where the show gains its power for an audience, I think, is in things that aren't investigative at all.

Question: [RETROACTIVE SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE NOT KEEPING UP] I'm watching Homeland and Sons of Anarchy more out of habit than passion these days, after what I thought were disappointing seasons for both. But even so, I was startled when their seasons ended on such grim notes in December, with the violent deaths of major characters. Which surprised you more: Brody's execution as Carrie bore witness on Homeland or Tara's brutal murder at Gemma's hands on Sons? Or did you see each of these events as inevitable? On the same note, which show do you think is better positioned to bounce back from these game-changers, or did they maybe (and I know you hate the expression) jump the shark? — Cass
