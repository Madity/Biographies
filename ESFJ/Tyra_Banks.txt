Tyra Lynne Banks[4] (born December 4, 1973)[5] is an American television personality, producer, author, actress, and former model.[6][7][8] She first became famous as a model, appearing twice on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and working for Victoria's Secret as one of their original Angels. Banks is the creator and host of the UPN/The CW reality television show America's Next Top Model, co-creator of True Beauty, and was the host of her own talk show, The Tyra Banks Show.
Banks is one of four African Americans and seven women to have repeatedly ranked among the world's most influential people by Time magazine.[9][10]
Tyra Banks was born in California. She is the daughter of Caroline London (now London-Johnson), a NASA photographer,[5] and Donald Banks, a computer consultant.[6][11] She has a brother, Devin, who is five years older.[12] In 1979, when Banks was six years old, her parents divorced. Banks attended John Burroughs Middle School and graduated in 1991 from Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles. As a child Tyra Banks suffered from what she calls[where?] an "ugly duckling" period in her life; when Banks was 11 years old she grew three inches and lost 30 pounds in three months.[citation needed]
When Banks was 15 years old, she started modeling while attending school in Los Angeles. She was rejected by four modeling agencies before she was signed by L.A. Models and then switched to Elite Model Management at age 16. When she got the opportunity to model in Europe, she put college on hold and moved to Milan. In her first runway season, she was booked in 25 shows at the 1991 Paris Fashion Week. She would later appear on the covers of magazines such as Elle, Teen Vogue and Vogue. She walked the runways for Chanel, Valentino, Fendi and others. She has featured in advertising campaigns for Dolce & Gabbana, Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren and Nike.[13] In the mid-1990s, Banks returned to America to do more commercial modeling.
Banks was the first African American woman on the covers of GQ and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.[14] In 1997, she received the VH1 award for, "Supermodel of the Year."[10] That same year, she became the first-ever African American chosen for the cover of the Victoria's Secret catalog.[15] She was a Victoria's Secret Angel from 1997 to 2005.[16] In 2010, Banks re-signed with her former modeling agency IMG Models.[17] Banks is now a contributor of the Vogue Italia website.[18] She has since started focusing on her film career and hosting her own TV show.
Banks's television career began on the fourth season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, in which she played lead character Will Smith's old friend Jackie Ames.[19] She made seven appearances in the series.[10][20] Other TV credits include Felicity,[21] All That, MADtv, Nick Cannon's Wild 'n Out (in which she was featured as a special guest host and team captain)[22] and The Price Is Right (guest-starring as a "Barker's Beauty").[23][24] She also appeared as a guest in the animated talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast in an episode entitled "Chinatown."[25]
Banks started her production company, "Ty Ty Baby Productions" — soon afterward changed to Bankable Productions — which produced The Tyra Banks Show, America's Next Top Model and the 2008 movie The Clique.[26] Banks is the hostess, judge and executive producer of The CW's America's Next Top Model. In addition, she hosted The Tyra Banks Show, a daytime talk show aimed at younger women, which premiered on September 12, 2005, and ran until May 28, 2010.[27] In 2008, Banks won the Daytime Emmy Award for her work and production on The Tyra Banks Show,[28] and won for the second time in a row for outstanding, informative talkshow in 2009.[29] In 2010, Oprah Winfrey congratulated Tyra Banks for a good job done on her talk-show for inspiring and mentoring young women.[30] On May 30, 2014, Disney–ABC Domestic Television announced their plans to develop a lifestyle syndicated talk show, with Banks serving as executive producer and host, to debut sometime in 2015.[31][32]
Banks's first big screen role came in 1994, when she co-starred in the drama Higher Learning.[33] She then co-starred with Lindsay Lohan in the Disney film Life-Size, playing a doll named Eve who comes to life and has to learn how to live in the real world. Other notable roles include Love Stinks (1999), Love & Basketball (2000), Coyote Ugly (2000) and Halloween: Resurrection (2002)."[10] She and Miley Cyrus poke fun at the excesses of the Hollywood lifestyle with a battle over a pair of shoes in Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009).[34] Banks appeared in the fourth episode of the third season of Gossip Girl playing Ursula Nyquist, a larger-than-life actress.[35] She also appeared on the Disney Channel show Shake It Up as a shy school librarian.
Banks has appeared in several music videos, including Michael Jackson's "Black or White", Tina Turner's "Love Thing", Mobb Deep's "Trife Life", George Michael's "Too Funky" (with supermodels Linda Evangelista, Estelle Lefébure, Emma Sjoberg and Nadja Auermann ) and Lionel Richie's "Don't Wanna Lose You". In 2004, she recorded her first single, "Shake Ya Body", which had a music video featuring the final six contestants of cycle 2 of America's Next Top Model. The video world-premiered on UPN.[36] Banks released a single with NBA player Kobe Bryant, entitled "K.O.B.E.," which was performed on NBA TV."[10] She also has a single on the soundtrack to Disney Channel's Original Movie Life-Size called "Be a Star".[10]
Banks announced in May 2010 that she would be writing a novel, titled Modelland,[37] loosely based on her own modelling experience.[38] Published September 2011,[dated info] it is the first of a planned three-part series.[39] On an interview with Good Morning America, Banks stated that Modelland is the story of four girls who are accepted into an "exclusive" modelling school in the world of Modelland.[40] Her first novel, Modelland, topped The New York Times Best Seller list in October 2011. In 1998, Banks co-authored a book entitled Tyra's Beauty, Inside and Out.[41]
In March 2011, Banks launched her fashion and beauty website called "typeF.com", which she co-created with Demand Media.[42]
In 2011, Banks enrolled in the nine-week [43] Owner/President Management Program (OPM) at Harvard Business School. Admission to the program, as described on HBS's website, "is a selective process based on professional achievement and organizational responsibility. We look for professionals who have demonstrated business talent and leadership potential." [43] Banks graduated from the Executive Education Training Program in February 2012, earning a certificate.[44][45] Tyra has come under intense criticism for implying she was a Harvard "graduate."[46] A biting article in Jezebel referred to her statements on Harvard as "disingenuous," and called upon her to "stop lying" about Harvard.[47][48] Harvard's own newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, was critical of Tyra's public statements about "attending" Harvard.[49]
Despite the harsh criticism, and the conclusion of her time as a HBS student, "Banks will be remembered within the HBS curriculum. Professor Rohit Deshpande is preparing a case study on Bankable Productions, Banks’ independent film and television production company, to be incorporated into future coursework for the Executive Education Owner/President Management Program." as cited on a different, and much more positive, article on The Harvard Crimson.[43] According to HBS Harbus, Harvard Business School's newspaper, on February 14, 2013, Tyra spoke with Harvard Business School Professor and Senior Associate Dean Youngme E. Moon in front of select audience at HBS. More than 100 students and faculty were invited to attend the event and hear Banks speak about her business and the reasons behind her decision to attend the program.[43]
Banks was romantically linked to musician Seal, film director John Singleton[50] and actor Will Smith in the 1990s.[51] She dated basketball player Chris Webber from 2001 to 2004.[50][52]
She is known for being outspoken on abusive relationships, having been a victim herself. In 2005, when asked about her relationship history, she stated, 'I won't be using a lot of names [on the show], but a specific relationship had not just cheating but emotional abuse. It was really bad, but that made me strong.'[53] In 2009, she opened up about her past abusive relationship when she made a guest appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, hosting alongside Oprah Winfrey. The episode was dedicated to dating violence in response to the assault of Rihanna by Chris Brown.[54][55][56]
, Tyra Banks established the TZONE program, which aimed at leadership and life skills development.[57][58] Banks acts as the patron for TZONE. She has also established the Tyra Banks Scholarship, a fund aimed at providing African-American girls the opportunity to attend her alma mater, Immaculate Heart High School. In 2005, TZONE transformed from a camp into a public charity, the Tyra Banks TZONE.

=======================================================
                Tyra Banks is a supermodel who has moved from posing in front of the camera to calling the shots behind it. Her TV show, 'America’s Next Top Model', is a huge international hit and has been syndicated worldwide. Tyra Banks was born on 4 December 1973, in Inglewood, California. Her father, Don Banks, was a computer consultant and her mother, Carolyn, was a medical photographer.  Banks' parents divorced when she was only six-years-old, but she says that she was too young for the divorce to have much impact on her: "As far as I could see I had it made," Banks remembers. "I stayed with Mommy on the weekdays and Daddy on the weekends. I had two birthday parties, two Christmases. Double the presents, double the love."  Banks says that she developed a love for food, and not always healthy food, from a very young age, devouring fried chicken, candied yams and pork chops at family gatherings. "I was taught to enjoy food, not to fear it," Banks recalls. She developed healthier habits, too, and began working out with her mother's exercise group at the age of six.  After her grandmother passed away from lung cancer, Banks also vowed never to smoke. Banks confesses that she was somewhat of a "mean girl" in school. "I was popular, gossipy," she recalls, "and if I didn't want one of the other girls to be in the clique anymore, for whatever tiny little reason, I voted her out."  When she attended Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles, however, she found herself on the other end of the social food chain. A sudden growth spurt left her tall and gawky and her classmates gave her the cruel nickname 'Giraffe'. "I went from being the popular girl who looked normal, to being considered a freak," Banks remembers.  Nevertheless, she says that the teasing and abuse taught her the importance of kindness. By 1989, at the age of 17, Banks had outgrown her awkward phase and began to resemble the tall, curvy, caramel-skinned and green-eyed beauty who would light up catwalks and magazine covers for years to come.  However, her first attempts to find a modelling agency were met with rejection and discrimination. Banks remembers that one agency said she looked "too ethnic", while another said that it "already had a black woman and didn't want another".  Then, in 1990, while still in high school, Banks landed a contract with Elite Model Management, the largest modelling agency in the world. Later that year, she shot her first print piece for Seventeen magazine. After graduating from high school in 1991, Banks enrolled at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, but decided to forego college when Elite offered to send her to Paris for high-fashion catwalk modelling.  She recently admitted in an interview with CBS that turning down a place at college was "one of the most difficult decisions of [her] entire life". She said that she made a commitment to try modelling for a year and if she was not successful after that time she was going to go back to university. Success did not evade her and she rose swiftly through the ranks of fashion modelling to become one of the world's top supermodels. She booked 25 catwalk shows while in Paris in 1991, an unprecedented feat for a newcomer to the industry.  But by the mid-1990s, Banks began to gain weight, a sin forbidden in the world of super thin clothing models. Unwilling to starve herself to achieve the desired physique for high-fashion models, Banks decided to return to the United States and switch to swimwear and lingerie modelling, where curvier models are more welcome.  "I made my living being 20 or 30 pounds heavier than the average model," Banks says. "And that's where I got famous. Victoria's Secret said I sold more bras and panties than anybody else, and I was traipsing down that runway with 30 pounds more booty than the other girls."  Banks created the worldwide hit show, 'America's Next Top Model' in 2003, which she also produces and presents. There have been 183 episodes and it is still going strong with versions being launched in Australia and Britain.  She had her own chat show, 'The Tyra Banks Show', which ran between 2005 and 2010, and fits in the odd bit of acting. In 2009, she was the executive producer of 'True Beauty', in which several models competed to be named the most beautiful person, without being told that the main purpose of the show was to choose the one with the best personality and virtues.  Banks started her acting career in the fourth season of 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air' playing Jackie Ames, an old friend of the main character played by Will Smith, in 1993.  She has appeared in several other TV shows including 'New York Undercover' (2007), 'The Hughleys' (1999), 'MADtv' (2000), 'Felicity' (2000), 'American Dreams' (2004) and teen drama 'Gossip Girl' in 2009.  In 2000, she acted in the film 'Coyote Ugly' followed by 'Halloween Resurrection' in 2002.  She also made an appearance as herself in the 2008 comedy 'Tropic Thunder', which starred Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey JR and Steve Coogan.  Banks has also written books, released a single and recently came out of retirement to model again. In 2004, she released her debut single 'Shake Ya Body', complete with a music video featuring the six finalists from 'America's Next Top Model' but it flopped.  She wrote her first book in 1998 entitled 'Tyra's Beauty Inside and Out'. Banks completed her first novel 'Modelland' in September 2011. It is the first in a planned three-part series about four girls that have been accepted into an exclusive modeling school. It reached the New York Times' Bestseller list in October 2011.  She recently announced that she is taking classes at Harvard Business School, in a bid to complete her unfulfilled ambition to attend college. She enrolled in the university's elite business management programme, which the model-turned-business-woman described in an interview with CBS as "pretty exclusive" and "quite expensive".  While being a costly exercise - $31,000 per year for tuition – she said she believes the investment is "so, so worth it". Talking about her decision to go back to college, Banks said in an interview with MTV News that she believes it is a "positive thing" for young women to see that they can be educated and "still be fabulous and fierce".  Not content with gaining a qualification from one of the country's top business schools, Banks has also been busy promoting her new fashion website, TypeF.com. She told ‘Early Show’ host Chris Wragge that business school taught her to stick to what you know, or as she describes it, your "core competency".  Taking that advice in hand, she chose to launch a site about fashion and beauty in March 2011, as that is what she says she knows best. Banks explained that the site has been designed as a place where people can get "personalised information ... based on their specific body type".

      While a high school student, Tyra applied to five colleges with the intention of majoring in film and television production.

      Self-love has very little to do with how you feel about your outer self. It's about accepting all of yourself. You've got to learn to accept the fool in you as well as the part that's got it goin' on.
      Black women have always been these vixens, these animalistic, erotic women. Why can't we be the sexy All-American girl next door?
      Believe it or not, I just really know how to pose well. It took me five years to learn what my best angles are.
      [on Adrianne Curry's complaints that she did not receive what was promised her as the winner of America's Next Top Model (2003).] I have an invested interest in all the girls. I take Adrianne's struggles to bed with me at night. Adrianne's problem was that she went to Europe to try to make it and nobody knew who she was there. So it was like starting over. But after a girl leaves the show it's really up to her to be aggressive and try to succeed.
      I'm a perfectionist. Sometimes I have to remind myself that it's OK if there are flaws here and there.
      I took guitar before ... well for two months but I remember nothing. My fingers used to hurt really bad when I played guitar. I stopped because of it.
      [About Barack Obama, who was in running for President in 2008]: When Barack won the nomination, I just started bawling. I started calling all these people, and everybody was talking to me like I was crazy. They're like, 'Well, he hasn't won yet,' but I'm like, 'Yes, he has because he's gotten this far.'
      [About her longtime struggled with chronic stomach aches]: I would get major attacks. I would be in bed for days, it was so painful.
      [on watching Sex and the City (1998), while exercising]: I got rid of one of my couches in my living room and I watched Sex and The City episodes on the treadmill or the elliptical, so Sex and the City lasts 30 minutes - that's how long I'm on the elliptical.
      [on re-evaluating her eating habits by keeping a food diary]: I switched up my unhealthy eating habits for healthier eating habits, and I haven't had a tummy attack since December '08.
      My next huge steps will allow me to reach more women and young girls to help us all feel as fierce as we truly are. There's a lot cooking right now and a lot of fire burning in my heart. And I salute you my amazing family of viewers; without you there never would have been a 'Tyra Show.' I really love you all.
      [on her decision to end The Tyra Banks Show (2005) in 2010]: I've been loving having fun, coming into your living rooms, bedrooms, hair salons for the past five years.
      [Who said about her teenage years in Los Angeles that being a supermodel wasn't a goal nor a dream]: It wasn't something that I always wanted to do -- it wasn't like I grew up and looked at magazines and said, 'Oooh, that's so glamorous, I wanna do that.' It found me. I was thin, I was 98 pounds, I was 5 foot 9, I was an inch shorter than I am now. So that is not just supermodel thin, that's just like, what's-wrong-with-her thin, and I had very low self-esteem because nothing I could do would make me gain weight.
      [When she began to question about the natural of beauty and the role race played]: I know that I got the covers of those magazines and that I had a very successful commercial side of the modeling industry. I think it had to do with my coloring and the fact that my eyes were green and my hair is sandy and my skin is caramel-colored. And I look at who society puts on a pedestal when it comes to black beauty, and a lot of the times it's a biracial girl, or a girl that does have lighter skin. I have made it one of the missions of my life to redefine and to open up the small box of what beautiful is.
      [on George Michael] I knew something was different and interesting about him. I knew he was extra special. I had such a crush on him like nobody's frickin' business. I was just like, "Why do I feel so comfortable with him?" I'm that little prepubescent teenage girl feeling so comfortable with him. It was probably because he was gay. I think young girls, their first crushes are gay men. It's a non-threat. Now I look at it and think, "Oh my God, he was gay. That's why I liked him. It was safe and he was gorgeous and stunning, and that amazing voice. And he was shaking that ass." He really resonated with me. Later I was in his music video "Too Funky." I went from being in love with him to being like, "You're fierce, bitch!"

Her résumé boasts stints as an actress, recording artist, author, talk-show host and reality-TV queen. She was signed by Elite modeling agency at 17 and whisked off to Paris, where she was an instant success, booking a record 25 shows. This early triumph was quickly followed by magazine covers and lucrative assignments with the world's leading fashion and makeup companies, including Yves St. Laurent and Dior. Later, Banks became the first black woman to grace the covers of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and the Victoria's Secret catalog. But she had more on her mind than modeling. She began acting in music videos, including Michael Jackson's Black or White, and had a recurring role on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Supporting TV and movie roles followed, most notably in 1995's Higher Learning, directed by her then-boyfriend John Singleton. But superstardom came in 2003 when Banks created, produced and hosted the reality competition America's Next Top Model. It quickly became a global sensation, with spin-offs in several countries, including Australia, Germany and Italy. In 2005, Banks retired from modeling and launched a daytime talk show that resulted in her first Daytime Emmy win in 2008.Tyra Banks Fast Facts:

=======================================================
Personal InformationBorn on December 4, 1973, in Los Angeles, CA; daughter of Don Banks (a computer consultant) and Carolyn London-Johnson (a business manager).Memberships: none.
Life's WorkTyra Banks has parlayed her supermodel status into film, television, and music; her career is proceeding well according to her ambitious plans. A hit on the runways of top designers since the early 1990s, Banks's career segued first into television and later into film, when she was cast in a leading role in the 1995 film Higher Learning, written and directed by John Singleton. With the help of a supportive family, Banks has successfully managed her fame in positive ways, and has chosen roles and collaborations with other African-American arts professionals who seek to portray their community in a diverse, multifaceted way. With her hit show America's Next Top Model and her budding pop music career, along with her continued modeling, Banks was poised to reap the benefits of superstardom.Grounded in Family LoveTyra Banks was born in Los Angeles December 4, 1973, to Carolyn and Don Banks. Her mother was a medical photographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, while her father is a computer consultant. They divorced when Tyra was six, although the relationship between parents and children--including Tyra's older brother Devin--remained amicable. Growing up, she would often parade around the family's Inglewood duplex in her mother's high heels and long robes, play-acting at being a model. Her view of the profession came largely from watching the weekly CNN program Style with Elsa Klensch, and later the MTV feature House of Style starring Cindy Crawford. In more serious moments, Banks entertained the idea of going to veterinary school. Yet her unusual looks sometimes made life difficult, as she told GQ writer James Ryan. "People called me Olive Oyl, Lightbulb Head, and Fivehead, because my forehead was so big," Banks recalled.Banks attended Immaculate Heart High School, a rigorous Catholic girls' school in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles, where classmates also teased her because of her increasing height (5'11") and weight (around 125 lbs). She told the Chicago Tribune that her most humbling experience in life was losing the prom queen crown to a girl she described as the smartest in her class. After graduating, she decided to try modeling on a lark, thinking it might be a good way to do some traveling. Since her mother was a photographer, putting a portfolio together was not a problem. Banks took her book to agencies, but, as mother Carolyn London-Johnson recalled for People magazine writers Tom Gliatto and Bryan Alexander, "The market for black models was not very good. They would say, 'We have this many black girls already.'"After encountering one too many dead ends, Banks decided to go ahead with her backup plan to start college and study film. Accepted at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, Banks was walking down the street two weeks before classes started when a model scout from France spotted her. The scout offered her immediate work for the upcoming fall haute couture shows in Paris, and Banks accepted. "Her sensual lope and sleek, space-age frame gave her instant catwalk charisma," People described the model in its "Fifty Most Beautiful Women" issue. Designer Todd Oldham likened Banks to "an antelope. She was just born with grace."Entranced the Paris RunwaysWithin Banks's first week in Paris, other designers were so entranced by her presence on the runway that she was booked for an unprecedented 25 shows--a record in the business for a newcomer. Next, Banks was offered lucrative contract deals, where the real money in the modeling industry lies. She was the first African American woman on the cover of Sports Illustrated's high-profile swimsuit issue; American designer Ralph Lauren wanted her for another one of his lush, multipage ad campaigns; and cosmetics giant Cover Girl made her the second African American to be offered a long-term deal with them.Yet Banks's early days in the modeling business were difficult for her, despite a naturally exuberant and flexible demeanor. Subtle racism within the industry was partly responsible; from the start, Banks was called the "new Naomi Campbell," in comparison to the more experienced supermodel who had been the star woman of color on the runways for some years. Campbell, known for her diva-like behavior, was incensed, and managed to get Banks barred from appearing in a Chanel show after refusing to speak to her on several other occasions. "No model should have to endure what I went through at 17," Banks told Essence writer Deborah Gregory. "It's very sad that the fashion business and press can't accept that there can be more than one reigning black supermodel at a time."Banks discussed the racism in the modeling industry with Cosmopolitan writer Jamie Diamond in 1993. "I've had bookers tell me, 'You've got light skin and green eyes. You're easy to sell.'" She admitted to relaxing her hair and having hair extensions done "because that's what 'beautiful' is supposed to look like--and that's how I make my living." Nevertheless, success does not insulate Banks from random acts of racism in everyday life. When she and a friend went to a New York City newsstand to purchase a magazine whose cover the model graced, the proprietor yelled at the two women and ordered them out of the store. When her friend pointed out the issue and Banks's image, he responded by saying "I don't care. You all look alike."Spotted by Influential DirectorThe difficulties engendered by her daughter's new profession helped convince Carolyn London-Johnson to heed Banks's urgings and get involved. She quit her job and moved to Paris for a time to become her full-time manager, an arrangement that has suited them well. Banks's father handles her finances, and the supermodel daughter did not move out of her mother's house until she was 21. A magazine cover for Essence in June of 1993 sparked the next big move in Banks's career. John Singleton, director of the Academy-Award-nominated Boyz 'N the Hood, spotted the magazine and thought she would be perfect for an as-yet-uncast role in his next film. After mutual friends introduced them, Singleton attended one of Banks's appearances on the runway. He was entranced. They struck up a friendship that blossomed into romance.Meanwhile, Banks had been cast in an occasional recurring role on the NBC-TV sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, starring former hip-hop star and feature-film actor Will Smith. Banks portrayed Jackie Ames, a love interest of Smith's title character. The acting experience made it easier when Singleton and the producers of his upcoming film Higher Learning asked her to read for the role of Deja, a star athlete at the film's fictional university. Some assumed that she had gotten the role because of her relationship with Singleton, the film's director, but Banks told Entertainment Weekly reporter Tim Appelo that "John said, 'Read for it, but if you're bad, you don't get it. I'd look like I'm thinkin' with my you-know-what.'" Her performance at the audition made an impact, however, and she won the role. Higher Learning won kudos from critics for its performances. Although Banks and Singleton eventually parted ways, Banks had established her acting career.After the success of Higher Learning, Banks bought herself a five-bedroom abode in Los Angeles. She has also endowed her alma mater, Immaculate Heart, with a scholarship for African American girls. "I was very privileged that my mother and father sent me to private school," Banks told Gregory in Essence. "I want other African-American girls who can't afford it to experience that kind of education." Although still modeling, she pursued her career on the screen with diligence, starting by reading up on the history of the film industry. Banks told Essence's Gregory that she had planned on a career in film prior to even thinking about modeling, but realized that the yoke of Supermodel would be a hard one to shed. "Even when I'm 50 and no longer modeling, everyone will still refer to me as 'Tyra the model.' Once a model, always a model."Yet being an African American model in an industry dominated by Caucasians has been difficult. "It's long overdue that black models receive the same benefits as white models," she told Essence's Gregory. "But I still don't make as much as the white supermodels do." Rather than waiting for the industry to catch up, Banks made her own plans for a multifaceted career. She formed a corporation in 1991--Tygirl, Inc.--to manage her career, and declined further involvement in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, in part because "everybody started coming up to me on the street and calling me Jackie Ames," she told Ryan in GQ. "I felt like I didn't want to get stereotyped into that character." The actor declined a role as a one-night stand with Tom Cruise's character in the 1993 film The Firm, primarily because of the one-dimensional, decorative nature of the character. "I don't want roles that scream, I AM SO PRETTY!," Banks told People magazine's Gliatto. Another rule? She freely admitted an important one to Appelo in the Entertainment Weekly article: "I'm not takin' off my clothes."Started a Televised Model HuntOver the next decade, Banks took her career in many different directions. She wrote a beauty book that preached about the necessity of recognizing one's own inner and outer beauty. She continued to take roles in films. While she played a doll magically given life in the made-for-television movie Life-Size, for the most part Banks remained true to her desire not to take roles that simply relied on her looks. In Coyote Ugly she played a law student named Zoe, and she faced the murderous Jason in Halloween: Resurrection. But Banks focused much more on her own image. Taking cues from the success of reality television programming, Banks created America's Next Top Model in 2003. The program follows the ups and downs of a group of models as they compete for the chance to win a modeling contract. Among the show's panel of experts, Banks is portrayed as a powerful gatekeeper to the world of high fashion and glamour. According to New Yorker television critic Nancy Franklin, "the aspiring models view her both as the bearer of a magic ticket out of poverty, obscurity, stripping, and waitressing and as a comforting, maternal, Oprah-like figure." The show was hailed in 2005 as UPN's most desirable show. Television analyst Carolyn Finger told Television Week that "It's the one show that universally it can be said any network would like to have."Among her other ventures, Banks planned to record music and launch herself as a pop diva. In addition she was preparing to launch her own talk show. Television Week noted that "Banks' planned talk show is considered one of the highest-profile pieces of development for syndication in 2005." Unlike her unique modeling show, which has since encouraged other similar shows, Banks understood that her talk show would be one among many. But, as she told Television Week, "there is a void right now for a talk show headed by someone of my generation.... I haven't seen it done how we're doing it. And I hope that will pay off." Only time will tell. However, Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution President Dick Robertson is banking on Banks. He told the Hollywood Reporter: "If there's ever a future Oprah, she could be the one."

"A smart model is a good model," Tyra Banks was once quoted as saying, and she seems destined to prove it in every way. Now widely known as one of the world's foremost supermodels, Banks began her modeling career at the age of 17 with the Elite agency after flirting with attending college at Loyola Marymount. The 5'11" beauty was quickly discovered in Los Angeles, her birth city, and offered a healthy contract with cosmetics company Cover Girl -- becoming only the third African-American woman in the world to secure such an opportunity.
Her striking looks and business savvy extended to several offers, including assignments with Ralph Lauren and various magazine covers (over 20 to be exact), including Sports Illustrated and most notably GQ, where Banks became the first black woman ever to grace the cover. In addition to various ads and runway gigs, Banks decided to branch out into feature films, scoring a few high-profile gigs, starring as Omar Epps' love interest in John Singleton's racially charged drama Higher Learning (1995) and snagging a stint opposite Will Smith on TV's The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. These breakout roles led to more film work, including a British sexploitation film called Inferno and a comic turn in 1999's Love Stinks with actors French Stewart and Bill Bellamy. In 2000, Banks landed a high-profile gig in the critically dismissed but lively Jerry Bruckheimer production Coyote Ugly.
Banks would find a useful avenue for her skills as a producer, host, and co-creator of the competetive reality show America's Next Top Model, an immensely successful franchise that would run from 2003 to 2012. Though her self-absorbed personna would often find her the subject of mockery, Banks would also launch an unsuccessful music career, as well as a talk show, and a handful of other reality shows, like True Beauty, and Stylista. ~ Jason Clark, Rovi

Banks was born in Los Angeles, California and attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girls, independent Catholic private school in Los Angeles.
Growing up, she was very thin and often teased; she was considered to be an "ugly duckling". Banks later said that this was a very difficult time for her and she developed a "very strong self-image problem."
In 1991, Banks was about to begin her freshman year at Loyola Marymount University when Elite modeling agency gave the 17-year-old her first modeling job. Prior to this entry into the fashion world, Banks had been rejected several times for modeling assignments.
In fact, she states that she did not deem her first job to be the start of a long career in fashion: "An agent saw pictures of me and said that I was the only girl she wanted to take back to Paris […] I didn't leave thinking I was going to be some big fashion model. I just wanted to make money for college."
Consequently, instead of heading to university, Banks went to Paris for fashion shows and soon gained international renown for her work. After several years, it emerged that Naomi Campbell was not particularly fond of Banks' increasing success, with the British supermodel trying to have Banks excluded from shows for Chanel. The pair since reconciled their differences during a taping of The Tyra Banks Show in 2005.
Despite these difficulties, Banks' career took off. She was the first African-American to be featured on the covers of Gentlemen's Quarterly, Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue, and the Victoria's Secret catalog, but is most famous for her Victoria's Secret work. And in 1997 she won the prestigious Michael Award for Supermodel of the Year.
Banks has done runway shows in Paris, Milan, Tokyo, U.S., and London. She has been featured in a variety of magazines, commercials, and billboards. Her modeling credits include CoverGirl, Swatch, Pepsi, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Victoria's Secret, Ralph Lauren, Mcdonalds, and Dolce & Gabbana. Banks has graced international fashion magazines, including the covers of Vogue, Elle, ELLEgirl, L'Officiel and Sports Illustrated.
In a time when some fashion models were described as being too skinny, Banks stood out with a more voluptuous physique at 5' 10½" tall and reported measurements of 34½-23½-35½. Banks had to work hard to persuade fashion designers that her physique was well-suited to the catwalk. She says: "I was proactive [...] I told my agency to call Victoria's Secret, and I told them to call Sports Illustrated [...] I said my body is changing, and seamstresses are calling me grosso in Italian, and I know what the hell that means. And I'm not about to starve."
Banks addressed her physique in an interview with The Sun, saying, "I am totally against plastic surgery. A lot of people think I have breast implants because I have the biggest boobs in the business. But I was a 34C when I was 17… They stay up when I wear a push-up bra. But if people could see me when I come home and take off my bra, how could they think these are fake?" [2] She is known for being openly proud of her body, once commenting, "Some models are quite flat-chested so they can run around without bouncing. I can't […]
Black women don't have the same body image problems as white women. They are proud of their bodies. Black men love big butts." Banks has made a point of shaking with her posterior while walking down the runway, particularly during Victoria's Secret fashion shows. This has been commented upon by fans of the supermodel, fellow supermodel Heidi Klum, as well as Banks herself.
Despite her tremendous success as a supermodel, Banks began venturing from modeling to becoming a media personality after 2000. She is the emcee, head judge, and an executive producer of the UPN television show America's Next Top Model. Banks has also been working on a musical career, and during season two of America's Next Top Model the contestants danced in her first music video.
Since then, she has been in the studio working with experienced record producers including Darkchild. She also acts as the patron for TZONE, a leadership program for young girls that according to the organisation, "reinforces core values of trust and support, challenges teen girls to resist negative social pressures, and enhances self-empowerment—inspiring girls to become confident leaders in their communities."
She has also established the Tyra Banks Scholarship, a fund aimed at providing African-American girls the opportunity to attend her alma mater, Immaculate Heart High School.
Banks has had a number of high-profile relationships with men, including director John Singleton, basketballer Chris Webber, and Seal (who later married model Heidi Klum). Banks has expressed her preference for a relationship with a "normal guy" in order to escape the pressures of being together with another well-known celebrity and the media scrutiny that comes with it.
Her personal wealth is estimated at over US$8.8 million from runway shows alone, making her currently one of the five wealthiest supermodels.
=======================================================
Tyra Banks was born on December 4, 1973 at Los Angeles, California to a very loving and caring family. Her parent got separated when she was six years old and she had to face all the torture of her brother Devin, but as a whole Tyra’s childhood was nicely supported. As a child Tyra was a tall, very thin and awkward and therefore her brother and classmates constantly teased her. Very often she used to run home crying to her mother for help. But it all changed late in her high school career when she began to work hard trying to shed of her skinny frame and finally decided to become a model. With lots of determination and courage Tyra has achieved her goal. She had to struggle initially when four modeling agencies did not show any interest in her as they thought her face was not photogenic. But luck finally smiled on Tyra as she at last signed a contract with the Elite agency. At that time she was only 17 years old. Therefore instead of attending Loyola Marymount College, Tyra went to Paris for a year. There she appeared in fashion big names including 'Ralph Lauren' and 'Chanel'. Then she returned back to the United States and continued modeling there. Tyra then appeared in a small part in the British television movie, 'Inferno' as a supermodel, and then on Will Smith's 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' in an interesting supporting role. But Tyra's first big break came in John Singleton's 'Higher Learning' where she played Omar Epps' girlfriend and though it was not a big role, the intensity and delight she presented in the character impressed every critics. Her performance really speaks about the volumes of talent she possesses. To present her character perfectly she trained herself in running long distance. As the film got to the theaters, she was offered numerous movie roles but Tyra was very selective in her approach. She continued her modeling career by appearing on the covers of several noted magazines. Tyra made history as the first African-American woman to appear on the covers of GQ magazine, the Victoria's Secret, and the well known Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. She was named in 'People Magazine's '50 Most Beautiful' list twice. Then she wrote an autobiography 'Tyra's Beauty Inside & Out' about her life. She was rumored to have a few high-profile relationships with John Singleton, pop singer Seal, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and Mark Messier. Tired of all this constant scrutiny about her life and celebrity relationships, she went back to her high school 'sweetheart', hoping to find some peace. But it was not to be as new rumors started to develop linking her with LA Lakers Kobe Bryant, Rick Fox, and even Teresa Witherspoon, who plays for New York in the WNBA. However Tyra often discloses about her desire to find a 'Normal Guy', about 5'11' one day. Tyra continued with her movie roles but her real breakthrough came in Hollywood with a small part in 'Love Stinks'. In the year 2000 she played a supporting role in the popular independent film 'Love & Basketball', and a starring role in the TV Disney movie 'Life-Size'. In this movie she was a doll who was brought to life by a wish. But she came into the spot light appearing for 'Coyote Ugly'. Here she plays the character of a wild bartender. This is very ironic because she does not drink alcohol. She also starred in movies like 'Disney's Honey Thunder Dunk' (also produced).
