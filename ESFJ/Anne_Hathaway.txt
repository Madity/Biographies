This article is about the actress.  For the wife of William Shakespeare, see Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare's wife).  For other uses, see Anne Hathaway (disambiguation).
Anne Jacqueline Hathaway (born November 12, 1982) is an American actress. After several stage roles, she appeared in the 1999 television series Get Real. She came to prominence after playing Mia Thermopolis in the Disney film The Princess Diaries (2001) and in its 2004 sequel. Since then, Hathaway has starred in dramatic films such as Havoc and Brokeback Mountain, in 2005. She has also starred in The Devil Wears Prada (2006) with Meryl Streep and in Becoming Jane (2007) as Jane Austen.
In 2008, she won several awards for her performance in Rachel Getting Married, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In 2010, she starred in the box office hits Valentine's Day, Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, and Love and Other Drugs and won an Emmy Award for her voice-over performance on The Simpsons. In 2011, she had a voice role in the animated film Rio. In 2012, she portrayed Selina Kyle in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises and Fantine in Tom Hooper's Les Misérables. Her performance in the latter earned her rave reviews and several accolades, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild Award, the BAFTA Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. People magazine named her one of its breakthrough stars of 2001,[1] and she appeared on its list of the world's 50 Most Beautiful People in 2006.[2]
Hathaway was born November 12, 1982 in Brooklyn, New York.[3] Her father, Gerald Thomas Hathaway, is a lawyer, and her mother, Kathleen Ann "Kate" (née McCauley), is an actress who inspired Hathaway to follow in her footsteps.[4] Hathaway's mother played Fantine in the first U.S. tour of Les Misérables.[5] When she was six years old, the family moved to Millburn, New Jersey, which is where she grew up.[6] Hathaway has an older brother, Michael, and a younger brother, Thomas. She is of mostly Irish and French ancestry, with distant Native American and German roots.[7]
Hathaway was raised Roman Catholic with what she considered "really strong values", and has stated she wanted to be a nun during her childhood.[6][8] However, she decided against it at the age of 15, after learning her brother Michael was gay.[8] She has stated: "I realised my older brother was gay, and I couldn't support a religion that didn't support my brother. Now I call myself a nondenominational Christian, because I haven't found the religion for me."[9] In 2009, Hathaway stated that her religious beliefs are "a work in progress".[8][10]
Hathaway attended Brooklyn Heights Montessori School and Wyoming Elementary School in Millburn.[11] Hathaway graduated from Millburn High School, where she participated in many school plays; her high school performance as Winnifred in Once Upon a Mattress gained her a Paper Mill Playhouse Rising Star Award nomination for Best Performance by a High School Actress. During this time, Hathaway was in plays including Jane Eyre and Gigi at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse.[12] She spent several semesters studying as an English major and Women's Studies minor at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York before transferring to New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study, referring to her college enrollment as one of her best decisions, because she enjoyed being with others who were trying to "grow up".[13] She also studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Hathaway was the first teenager admitted into The Barrow Group Theater Company's acting program.[14]
A soprano, Hathaway performed in 1998 and 1999 with the All-Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus at Carnegie Hall and has performed in plays at Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey. Three days after her 1999 performance at Carnegie Hall, she was cast in the short-lived Fox television series Get Real at the age of 16.[12]
Hathaway is a trained stage actress and has stated that she prefers performing on stage to film roles.[6] Her acting style has been compared to those of Judy Garland and Audrey Hepburn.[15] She cites Garland as one of her favorite actresses[11] and Meryl Streep as her idol.[16]
Hathaway's first role in a motion picture was opposite Christopher Gorham in Walt Disney's drama film The Other Side of Heaven (2001), inspired by John H. Groberg's memoir In the Eye of the Storm. Before production of the film, she was cast alongside Julie Andrews in the lead role of Mia Thermopolis in another Disney production, the comedy film The Princess Diaries, based on Meg Cabot's 2000 novel of the same name and directed by Garry Marshall. Hathaway auditioned for the role of a princess-to-be during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand and was cast on the strength of this one audition.[11] She won the role over 500 other girls.[3] Released prior to The Other Side of Heaven in hopes that its success would increase interest in Heaven, The Princess Diaries became a major commercial success, grossing US$165 million worldwide.[17] Many critics praised Hathaway's performance, with a BBC critic noting that "Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry."[18] Also released in 2001, The Other Side of Heaven, directed by Mitch Davis, met with mostly negative reviews, but it performed well for a religion-themed film.[19][20]
In February 2002, Hathaway starred in the City Center Encores! concert production of Carnival! in her New York City stage debut, receiving positive reviews for her portrayal of Lili.[21] Also in 2002, Hathaway began voicing the audio book releases of The Princess Diaries and has since voiced the first three books of the series. She also provided the voice of the character Haru in the English version of Hiroyuki Morita's The Cat Returns.[22]
Hathaway continued to appear in family-oriented films over the next three years, subsequently becoming known in mainstream media as a children's role model.[23] In 2002, she appeared in Douglas McGrath's comedy-drama Nicholas Nickleby, opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, which opened to positive reviews. The Deseret News said that the cast was "Oscar-worthy".[24] Despite critical acclaim, the film never entered wide release and failed at the North American box office, totaling less than $4 million in ticket sales.[25] Hathaway's next film role was as the titular character in the rom-com fantasy film Ella Enchanted (2004), a loose adaption of Gail Carson Levine's 1997 novel of the same name, which opened to mostly indifferent reviews.[26][27] Hathaway sang two songs in the film as well as three on the soundtrack, including a duet with singer Jesse McCartney.
In 2003, Hathaway dropped out of her role in Joel Schumacher's The Phantom of the Opera (2004), because the production schedule of the film overlapped with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, which she was contractually obligated to make.[28] Disney began production on The Princess Diaries 2 in early 2004, and it was released in August of that year. The film opened to negative reviews, but made $95.1 million against a $40 million budget.[29]
Hathaway began appearing in dramatic roles after The Princess Diaries 2. She said that "anybody who was a role model for children needs a reprieve", although she noted that "it's lovely to think that my audience is growing up with me".[13] She voiced Red Puckett in the animated comedy Hoodwinked! (2005), based on the Little Red Riding Hood folktale, which received mixed reviews by critics. Hathaway replaced Red's original voice artist Tara Strong and sang the song "Great Big World". That same year, Hathaway starred in Barbara Kopple's drama film Havoc, in which she played a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. Although the content of the film was different from her previous films, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt to be seen as a more mature actress, citing her belief that doing nudity in certain movies is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; and because of that belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable.[30]
After Havoc, Hathaway was cast alongside Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Ang Lee's drama Brokeback Mountain (2005). While Havoc was not released in theaters in the United States because of its weak critical reception,[31] Brokeback Mountain won rave reviews and received several Academy Award nominations.[32] Hathaway would later assert that the content of Brokeback Mountain was more important than its award count and that making the film made her more aware of the kind of stories she wanted to tell as an actress.[33]
In 2006, Hathaway appeared in David Frankel's comedy The Devil Wears Prada, in which she starred as an assistant to a powerful fashion magazine editor portrayed by Meryl Streep, whom Hathaway described as being "just divine".[6] Hathaway said that working on the film made her respect the fashion industry a great deal more than she had previously, though she claimed that her personal style is something she "still can't get right".[14] In an interview with Us Weekly, Hathaway discussed the weight loss regimen she and co-star Emily Blunt followed for the film, she stated, "I basically stuck with fruit, vegetables and fish [to slim down]. I wouldn't recommend that. Emily Blunt and I would clutch at each other and cry because we were so hungry."[34]
Hathaway was cast in the 2007 comedy Knocked Up, but dropped out before filming began and was replaced by Katherine Heigl. Writer/director Judd Apatow stated in a May 2007 issue of The New York Times Magazine that this happened because "she didn't want to allow us to use real footage of a woman giving birth to create the illusion that she is giving birth".[35] In an August 2008 interview with Marie Claire, Hathaway commented that she "didn't believe that it was necessary to the story".[36]
Hathaway was in the 2007 drama Becoming Jane, in which she portrayed English writer Jane Austen.[33] Tim Burton considered Hathaway for the part of Johanna Barker in his 2007 film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, but the role went to Jayne Wisener, a then-unknown actress, reportedly because Burton decided he wanted an unknown, younger actress for the part.[37]
In January 2008, Hathaway joined beauty giant Lancôme as the face of their fragrance Magnifique, and in October of that year, Hathaway hosted the NBC late-night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live.[38] Her first film of the year was a modern adaptation of the 1960s Mel Brooks television series Get Smart, in which she starred opposite Steve Carell, and Alan Arkin, portraying Agent 99. Directed by Peter Segal, the film was a hit at the box office, prompting talk of a sequel.[39] She also made a cameo appearance in the tie-in film Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd: Out of Control. Also in 2008, she premiered the drama Passengers, alongside Patrick Wilson, as well as the drama Rachel Getting Married, opposite Debra Winger. Rachel Getting Married premiered at the 2008 Venice and Toronto Film Festivals and garnered her widespread critical acclaim for her performance as Kym, including nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Hathaway said that the film appealed to her because of its real depiction of relationships and because of the strong emotional connection she felt with her character.[40]
Hathaway appeared in the comedy Bride Wars, released in 2009, which she described as being "hideously commercial – gloriously so".[41] In addition to providing her voice for episodes of The Simpsons, which garnered her an Emmy Award in 2010 for outstanding voice-over performance,[42] and Family Guy in 2010,[43][44] Hathaway also appeared as Viola in the New York Shakespeare Festival's summer 2009 production of Twelfth Night at the Delacorte Theater in New York City's Central Park, opposite Audra McDonald as Olivia, Raul Esparza as Duke Orsino, and Julie White as Maria.[45] In the same year, Hathaway was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[46]
In 2010, Hathaway played the White Queen in Tim Burton's adaptation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass alongside Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp. She summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife; "Cute but psycho. Things even out."[47] Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as "a punk-rock vegan pacifist", with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry, Greta Garbo, and the artwork of Dan Flavin.[48]
Other projects included the romantic comedy The Fiancé,[49] an adaptation of the Julie Buxbaum novel The Opposite of Love, the Garry Marshall-directed ensemble comedy Valentine's Day, and an adaptation of Gerald Clarke's biography Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland, in which she will play the title role on the stage and screen.[50]
It was reported on December 8, 2009, that Hathaway was up for the role of Felicia Hardy in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 4. Hardy would not have transformed into the Black Cat, as in the comics; instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a brand-new superpowered figure called the Vulturess.[51]
On January 5, 2010, it was reported that Spider-Man 4 would be rewritten and Hathaway would not appear in the film, as she was "too expensive".[52] On November 29, 2010, it was announced that Hathaway and James Franco would host the 83rd Academy Awards.[53]
Together with actor Denzel Washington, Hathaway hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway on December 11, 2010.[54] In 2010, she was named one of the sexiest stars of 2010 by Entertainment Weekly.[55]
In 2011, Hathaway voiced the character Jewel, a female Spix's Macaw from Rio de Janeiro, in the animated adventure-comedy film Rio, produced by 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios.[56] The film received generally positive reviews from film critics who praised the visuals, voice acting, and music.[57] A commercial success, it went on to gross over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide.[58]
Also in 2011, Hathaway starred alongside Jim Sturgess in the romance One Day. Adapted by David Nicholls from his 2009 novel of the same name and directed by Lone Scherfig, the film tells the story of two young people who meet on the same day, July 15, for the twenty years after they share a one-night stand together at university. Hathaway was clandestinely given the script as One Day was set in the United Kingdom and Scherfig was not looking for any American actresses for the part. After a nonproductive meeting with Scherfig, Hathaway left a list of songs for Scherfig to listen to, which eventually led to Hathaway getting the part.[59] However, Hathaway's Yorkshire accent in the role of Emma was later widely regarded as subpar. Columnist Suzanne Moore, reviewing the film on BBC Radio 4's Front Row, said the accents were "all over the shop". Moore went on to say, "Sometimes she's from Scotland, sometimes she's from New York, you just can't tell".[60] The film itself received mixed to negative reviews from critics,[61] but became a moderate box office success, grossing a total of $56.7 million with a budget of $15 million.[62][63]
In 2012, Hathaway's audiobook recording of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was released at Audible.com. Her performance was nominated for a 2013 Audie Award for Best Solo Narration - Female.[64]
Later in 2012, Hathaway played sly, morally ambiguous cat burglar Selina Kyle in The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher Nolan's final installment in his Batman film trilogy.[65] Hathaway auditioned not knowing what role she was being considered for, admitting that she had one character in mind, but only learned that the role was Selina Kyle after talking with Christopher Nolan for an hour.[66] She described the role as being the most physically demanding she had ever played, and confessed that while she thought of herself as being fit she had to redouble her efforts in the gym to keep up with the demands of the role.[67][68] Hathaway trained extensively in martial arts for the role, and looked to Hedy Lamarr—who was the inspiration for the Catwoman character—in developing her performance.[69] Upon release The Dark Knight Rises received a positive critical response and grossed over $1.081 billion worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2012.[69] Hathaway also won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Selina Kyle.[70]
Hathaway's other 2012 project was Tom Hooper's film Les Misérables, which was based on the musical of the same name and in which she played Fantine.[71][72] Her mother had played the role in the stage show's first national U.S. tour.[5] Footage of Hathaway singing "I Dreamed a Dream", a song from the film, was shown at CinemaCon on April 26, 2012. Hooper described Hathaway's singing as "raw" and "real".[73] For the role, Hathaway lost a substantial amount of weight, and, in character, had her long hair cut short on camera. She stated that the lengths she goes for her roles do not "feel like sacrifices. Getting to transform is one of the best parts of [acting]."[74][75] For her performance, Hathaway received critical acclaim and won over 30 different awards, including the Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild Award and BAFTA Award for best supporting actress.[76] Christopher Orr from The Atlantic wrote that "Hathaway gives it everything she has, beginning in quiet sorrow before building to a woebegone climax: she gasps, she weeps, she coughs. If you are blown away by the scene—as many will be—this may be the film for you."[77] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that "The centerpiece of a movie composed entirely of centerpieces belongs to Anne Hathaway, who as the tragic heroine Fantine sings another of the memorable numbers".[78] In January 2013, Hathaway's rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream" reached number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100.
Hathaway reprised her role as Jewel in the animated film Rio 2, which was released in the United States on April 11, 2014.[79] In April 2013, it was reported that Hathaway was near a deal to star in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, along with Matthew McConaughey. The science-fiction film will pertain to relativist Kip Thorne's theories on wormholes. It is set to be released in the United States on November 7, 2014.[80][81]
In 2004, Hathaway began a romantic relationship with Italian real estate developer Raffaello Follieri,[6][82] during which she participated in the development of the charitable Follieri Foundation, as a donor and as a member of its board of directors until 2007.[83] The Manhattan-based foundation, established in 2003, focused on efforts such as providing vaccinations for children in Third World countries. In June 2008, it was investigated by the IRS, for failure to file required nonprofit information forms.[84] Citing concern that this investigation and other legal issues in which Follieri was involved could hurt her acting career, Hathaway ended their relationship in mid-June, 2008.[83]
Follieri was arrested on June 24, 2008, on charges of defrauding investors out of millions of dollars in a scheme in which Follieri posed as the Vatican's point man on real-estate investing.[85] It was reported that the FBI confiscated Hathaway's private journals from Follieri's New York City apartment as part of their ongoing investigation into Follieri's activities; however, Hathaway was not charged with any crime.[86] On October 23, 2008, after earlier pleading guilty, Follieri was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.[87][88]
In November 2008, Hathaway began dating actor Adam Shulman.[89] The couple became engaged in November 2011[90] and were married on September 29, 2012, in Big Sur, California[91] in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service.[92][93]
Hathaway is involved with charities, including The Creative Coalition, The Step Up Women's Network, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, The Human Rights Campaign, and The Lollipop Theatre Network.[94] In 2008, she was honored at Elle magazine's "Women in Hollywood" tribute,[95] and has also been honored for her work with Step Up Women's Network.[96] In early 2007, Hathaway spoke of her experiences with depression during her teenage years, saying that she eventually overcame the disorder without medication.[97]
In 2008, on Late Show with David Letterman, Hathaway said she had once again stopped smoking.[98] The actress, who had begun smoking "heavily" while filming Rachel Getting Married, had "quit for a while", but had started again in the wake of her stressful summer and the end of her relationship with Raffaello Follieri.[99][100][101] She credited quitting smoking for the subsequent decline in her stress level, and declared her return to being vegetarian.[101][102] She later became a vegan in early 2012.[103] Hathaway is an LGBT rights activist and has donated money to organizations that support same-sex marriage.[104][105]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Anne Hathaway's first major role came in the short-lived television series Get Real (1999). She gained widespread recognition for her roles in The Princess Diaries (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she's a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo.She also had a notable role in Nicholas Nickleby (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Ella Enchanted (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of "Christine" in the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn't take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum.Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc (2005) opposite Josh Peck and Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her desire to break out of her "Princess Diaries" image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. (1981) in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals. In interviews, Hathaway said that doing family-friendly films didn't mean she was similar to their characters or mean she objected to appearing nude in other films.
        Often plays free-spirited women who attempt to remain independent but have difficulty doing so
      First and only teenager admitted to the acting program at the award-winning The Barrow Group in New York. Three days before being cast in Get Real (1999), she performed in two concerts at Carnegie Hall as member of All- Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus.
      In his column "Just for Variety" published on October 25, 2000 in Daily Variety, columnist Army Archerd quotes Garry Marshall, the director of The Princess Diaries (2001): "The multi-talented Hathaway is a combination Julia Roberts, Audrey Hepburn and Judy Garland."

      Her father, Gerald T. Hathaway, is an attorney and her mother, Kate McCauley Hathaway, is a singer and actress.
      She grew up in New Jersey, but loves being a Manhattanite for most of last seven years now, as demonstrated by her 2013 Oscar-night comments. On the red carpet she boasted wearing a Tiffany necklace as "a New York girl" should. And in her acceptance speech she thanked "my friends, especially the ones who are cheering from Crosby Street tonight," which is right near her very downtown Lower East Side apartment in the converted Avalon Bowery building.

The nomination ballot listed her as Annie Hathaway.
      Parents, Gerald T. Hathaway and Kate McCauley Hathaway, attended La Salle University in Philadelphia during the 1970s, graduating one year apart.
      Everyone knows that The Princess Diaries (2001) was her breakthrough role, but it is a little known fact that she auditioned for that part on her way to New Zealand to co-star in another film with Christopher Gorham. She reported to others on the set that she felt really good about the audition. Film-makers knew that she would be a big star, so the film in question, The Other Side of Heaven (2001), was delayed in post production and released after The Princess Diaries (2001) in order to capitalize on her stardom.
      Was not available for role of Christine Daae in The Phantom of the Opera (2004) due to contractual obligation to Disney for The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004).. The two movies had overlapping filming schedules.

      She is an honoree of women's empowerment organization the Step Up Women's Network and is also an advisor for the Lollipop Theater Network, that screens movies in hospitals for the terminally ill.
      Has an older brother, Michael Hathaway, who is a writer and a younger brother, Tom Hathaway, who is an aspiring actor.

      After the release of The Princess Diaries (2001), Anne's hometown newspaper, The Item, printed an article comparing Anne to Greta Garbo because of the paper's inability to get an interview with Anne (who was busy making movies and living in LA at the time).
      She grew up in Millburn Township, New Jersey, which is adjacent to the town of Summit, NJ, which is the birthplace of her The Devil Wears Prada (2006) co-star Meryl Streep. Meryl grew up in Bernardsville, NJ.

McGinley, attended Millburn High School - Anne's alma mater.
      Her TV debut was in a Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate commercial filmed in 1997 in Maplewood, New Jersey.
      Left Raffaello Follieri days before he was arrested for wire fraud and money laundering. Follieri plead guilty in September 2008 to misappropriating $50 million in a Ponzi scheme involving properties owned by the Catholic Church, and may have defrauded investors, including Ron Burkle, of as much as $100 million. During its investigation of the case, the FBI seized Hathaway's diaries.
      Was almost cast as Johanna in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), but Tim Burton wanted an unknown actress for the role, and newcomer Jayne Wisener got the role.
      Accidentally fell off of her chair during her audition for the role of the klutzy princess in The Princess Diaries (2001). She was hired on the spot.
      For the movie The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Hathaway was told to gain 10 pounds (bringing her weight to 130) only to be told afterward that she would have to lose 10 pounds and they would pad her for the "fat scenes".

She got caught up in a riptide, and while her husband, Adam Shulman, lay out of earshot on the beach, a fast-acting surfer came to her rescue. According the New York Post's Page Six, she began waving her arms and screaming as the waves engulfed her, catching the attention of the local man who ran down the beach to her aid with a boogie board.
      Is a good friend with Les miserables (2012) co-star Hugh Jackman. In fact he suggested Anne for the role of Fantine which later she won every major award for and thanked him in her speeches.
      Was the 140th actress to receive an Academy Award; she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Les Misérables (2012) at The Oscars (2013) on February 24, 2013.
      I look my best after an entire hair and makeup team has spent hours perfecting me. When do I feel my best? When I haven't looked in a mirror for days, and I'm doing things that make me happy.
      Kindness is really important to me in finding my own prince - so are patience and a sense of humor. Without those qualities he's no Prince Charming!
      I really don't drink, I don't do drugs. I feel like right now I've been given so many opportunities I don't want to mess it up with those things ... I think I was raised in a solidly upper-middle class family who had really strong values and excess was not one of the things that my family put up with. - On avoiding the hard partying young-star life style.
      She is just divine. As a human being, she has basically accomplished everything that I want to do ... It's not that she just gets inside the character, she's just absolutely at the center of all of her choices, of the truth of the character - On working with Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada (2006).
      She can act sweet, but she's fundamentally a predator - On her character "Lureen" in Brokeback Mountain (2005).
      In Hollywood you have to be careful if you go above a six, then you're considered fat. I'm considered to be, I hope, an actress, and you can get away with a couple of extra pounds if you are trading on your talent instead of your sex appeal.I don't have time to be tortured about me weight.
      Over the last few years I've learned that the Next Big Thing is something a lot of people wish and want for you - but what you wish for yourself is really important too.
      "College is such a unique time because you're learning a little bit how to be an adult. You're learning how to take care of yourself without parental influence, and you're exposed to so many great minds. I feel like I didn't even know how to think until I got to college." - On the importance of a college education.
      I've worked with people and I've known people that were really competitive but I've always said that I take an Elizabeth Bennett philosophy of life - I laugh. I love my job but if it means hurting someone I won't do it.
      I got into this business to be an actress, to scare myself and force myself into a place outside of my comfort zone. I have nothing against The Princess Diaries (2001) - but it has been a brick wall at times for my career.
      I disagree with a couple of the stances of the Catholic Church. My older brother is gay and it's important for me to be able to love him completely and freely and it's important for me to spread beliefs in the world that are not going to limit people in their love.I can't support a religion that doesn't support my brother.
      Films are letting me get older, which is really nice, because there was always this fear of what happens when I stop being a teenager. But for everyone else, it was kind of a sharp left.
      I think that fashion can be a lot of fun. I love clothes, but I recognize that it should only be a hobby. Some clothes that are more design-based look better on women with figures like wire hangers, because that's the nature of the design. I won't wear those clothes.
      I'll be honest with you, it really, really, really annoys me, the image that's put out there for women. These tiny, tiny bodies, with absolutely no fat at all on them. It's unhealthy, plain and simple, and there are only a handful of women in the world who are naturally like that. It makes me sick.
      ... it's not something that I have ever aspired to be or courted because I think the second that you say, "Oh, I am a role model and that's why I make the decisions that I make," you've kind of shot yourself in the foot. A role model is somebody that does things because of what they believe in regardless of what other people think. (Her views on role models)
      I cry terribly easily. Just a minute ago, I was reading an article about Kate Winslet in Vogue, and I love her so much, I started crying, realizing how great she is and how far I have to go.
      'I've had directors say to me, 'You're the best actress for the role, but you've put on weight recently.' If people can't understand you've put on five pounds, I don't want to deal with them.
      I love working and I feel satisfied when I know I have literally given all the energy that I have. That being said, work is not my No. 1 priority. I don't think it can come at the expense of your family, your friends and your 'significant other' if you have one.
      "I'm very aware of my own background. I'm Irish, French and then a little bit of everything else thrown in, ranging from German to native American. We're talking about tiny drops of blood.''
      I spent a lot of time in the early part of my career staying within the same realm with a lot of my film choices. I don't regret that, considering that my first movie was ... a very popular film. So, all of a sudden, I had opportunities, I had attention, I had buzz and heat and all those things that people tell you you are supposed to work for and I didn't know if I could act.
      (On performing love scenes with Steve Carell in Get Smart (2008)] Making out with him is like the yummiest lollipop. Dipped in sunshine. And wrapped around in a masculine wrapper.
      That was tough. I hesitate to talk about Heath. He was special in so many ways. I can tell you that I feel I cared about him more than I actually knew him. It was devastating, and the people who were closest to him should talk about him in their own time. - On the death of her Brokeback Mountain (2005) costar Heath Ledger.
      I try not to date where I work. It makes life easier.I don't say no to anybody because I'd hope that people wouldn't say no to me just because I'm an actor - but they'd have to be pretty extraordinary. - On dating actors.
      I'm not going to win. I'm in a dramatic category with Meryl Streep. No contest. (About Meryl Streep who was in her category in Critics' Choice Awards 2009.)
      I gave up my struggle with perfection a long time ago. That is a concept I don't find very interesting anymore. Everyone just wants to look good in the photographs. I think that is where some of the pressure comes from. Be happy. Be yourself, the day is about a lot more. If designers want to dress me then I am at the larger end of the Hollywood scale so they have to be fine with that. And I think what some designers do is if a dress doesn't fit you because it's been fitted to a size zero model they will remake the dress for you.
      On the day I shot the scene where I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, I thought we were filming, but it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people. But hey, I just did my job. (On Love & Other Drugs (2010))
      I think we are moving away from the idea there is one way to look. Oddly enough, the TV show Mad Men (2007) has done a huge and wonderful thing for women's bodies by showing what women used to naturally look like. We kind of forgot because women have been encouraged to manipulate their bodies for so many years to look like one ideal.
      When my brother came out, we all felt like 'we love you and so what' - he was still Mike. It has since become a much bigger issue for us because when Mike wanted to marry his partner, he could only do it in Canada. Whatever your feelings about gay marriage, you have to accept that to ban it is discrimination, it's a human rights issue. No one can tell my brother he can't do anything and I will fight to my last breath to make sure he gets the same rights as me.
      It was definitely out of my comfort zone and it required an extra little dose of courage every day. But I don't think there's anything wrong with nudity in films. I would go into my trailer and a make-up artist would put body make-up on me and then I would compulsively do sit-ups and push-ups until they needed me on set. But then we would do the sex scenes and afterwards we would just be Jake (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Annie chilling out. It was very innocent. (On Love & Other Drugs (2010))
      Ireland is such an amazing country, and I have this little dream in the back of my head that someday I'll end up living there. When I've established myself in America and I don't need to live near the action, so to speak, and if you're good, the work will come to you. I feel very Irish; maybe that's why I've been so lucky with my career. On my father's side, we have relatives all over Cork and Donegal.
      [about how she chose to sing "I Dreamed a Dream" in Les Misérables (2012)] There seemed to be something selfish about trying to go for "the pretty version". She's devastated, she's literally at the bottom of a hole, looking up and realizing she's never going to climb out of this. So I just decided to apply the truth to the melody and then see what would happen.
      Fantine is not just a character that lived centuries ago. Women are having sexual experiences for less than a dollar a day so their children can eat. There's someone like her a block from us right now. And that should be to our collective, mutual outrage and shame.
      I think that when actors are living very public lives, it affects your ability to get lost in their performances.
      My favorite fashion is daring. I love it as an art form. I love it when people are able to interpret thoughts and feelings on fabric.

                Not to be confused with William Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway is a talented American actress who has just been thrust into the mainstream for her portrayal of Catwoman.Anne Jacqueline Hathaway was born on 12 November 1982 in Brooklyn, New York City. She has since made a name for herself as a talented yet sometimes outspoken actress.  Her father Gerald Thomas Hathaway is a lawyer while her mother Kathleen Ann is an actress, perhaps inspiring a young Anne in her prospective career path in later life. At the age of six years, Anne's family moved to Milburn in New Jersey, where she grew up.  Initially, Hathaway wanted to be a nun as she was brought up a Roman Catholic but she decided against this when she found out her elder brother Michael was gay when she was 15-years-old. A teenage Hathaway concluded she couldn't support a religion that didn't support her brother.  During her childhood, she took part in plenty of school plays at Milburn High School. Notable performances included Winifred in Once Upon A Mattress and Jane Eyre.  She studied English and Women's Studies at Vassar College in New York before transferring to New York University's Gallatin School of Individualised Study. Hathaway is also a trained stage actress and soprano singer and has claimed she prefers appearing on stage to film.  In 1998 and 1999, she performed with the All-Eastern US High School Honours Chorus at Carnegie Hall before being cast in the short-lived TV series Get Real at the age of 16 years.  Hathaway's first major role in a motion picture occurred in 2001 when she appeared in the Walt Disney film The Princess Diaries alongside Julie Andrews. Despite auditioning for the role of Mia Thermopolis on a flight from New Zealand, Hathaway won the role over 500 other girls. Her first film became a commercial success and brought her into the limelight.  Prior to The Princess Diaries, Hathaway had filmed another Walt Disney movie called The Other Side of Heaven (2001), which was released after the aforementioned film to boost interest in the latter.  In February 2002, Hathaway made her New York City stage debut in Carnival!, which was met with positive reviews. Over the next three years, she became a children's role model by appearing in family-orientated films including Elle Enchanted (2004), The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004) and Hoodwinked! in 2005.  After this, Hathaway took on more varied roles including a spoiled socialite in the 2005 movie Havoc in which she appears nude in several scenes. She then appeared in the highly-acclaimed Brokeback Mountain in 2005, which helped the young actress to decide what type of stories she wants to tell in her films.  For her next role, Hathaway went on a strict weight loss regime as she was playing a fashion assistant in the comedy The Devil Wears Prada in 2006. This was followed by her portrayal of British novelist Jane Austen in Becoming Jane in 2007 for which Hathaway put on an English accent. In 2008, she appeared in the comedy Get Smart before roles in Rachel Getting Married and Passengers.  Hathway continued with comedy with a lead role in Bride Wars with Kate Hudson in 2009 before voicing a character in The Simpsons. In 2010, she appeared in two romantic comedies – Valentine's Day and Love and Other Drugs. She then took on the role of the White Queen in Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland.  In 2011, she voiced the character Jewel in Rio and is thought to be returning to Rio 2 in 2014. She once again had to put on an English accent for her lead part in One Day, which is based on the novel by David Nicholls of the same name.  Hathaway then stood out in the star-studded ensemble of Christopher Nolans' Batman: The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 as Catwoman , with some hoping for a spinoff for the character. She will also be appearing in the film adaptation of Les Miserables later this year for which she lost weight and shaved her head. The actress will be showing off her singing talents.  She has also showcased her singing skills while presenting the 2010 Oscars with James Franco.  In terns of her personal life, she is now preparing to marry actor Adam Shulman who she began dating in November 2008. This is after her previous relationship with Italian real estate developer Raffaello Follieri went badly wrong.  Hathway began dating Follieri in 2004 before his organisation the Follieri Foundation was investigated by the IRS in 2008 over tax evasion. Concerned this would impact her acting career, she ended the relationship in June 2008. He was later charged to four-and-a-half years in prison, while Hathaway was never charged with any crime.  Since then, she has become engaged to Shulman with the couple planning their wedding for next year (2013).

circa 1996A Jersey Girl Acts OutDespite her parents' objection, Hathaway appears in several plays at local theatre, the Paper Mill Playhouse, in Milburn, N.J. "They so wanted me to have a normal life as a kid," she tells the New York Times in 2001, of her parents – Gerald, an attorney, and Kate, who was in a national touring company of Les Misérables. The young Hathaway goes on to study with the Barrow Group, a prestigious New York theatre company, for six months. 1999September 08Hathaway Gets RealAt 16, Hathaway plays overachieving daughter Meghan Green in the Fox drama series Get Real (pictured with costar Eric Christian Olsen).

"We're bringing fairy tales to a new generation," Hathaway tells USA Today. "All of a sudden, there's these real characters girls have to look up to...We've all seen Cinderella be the good, sweet girl who's kind of worshiped for her beauty, and that's kind of boring. But if you can give her a brain and a personality and a point of view, that just makes the story more enjoyable." SpringHathaway & FollieriHathaway, 21, begins dating Italian real estate developer Raffaello Follieri, 26. He starts a five-year program to immunize disadvantaged children throughout Central America in 2005, and Hathaway accompanies him on trips to Nicaragua and Honduras. They help vaccinate 11,0000 children against hepatitis A in 2006, and she tells Harper's Bazaar, "My boyfriend is incredible in a lot of ways...One of the most untouted aphrodisiacs in the world is charity work. Seriously, you want a girl to be impressed, vaccinate some kids, build a house."2005October 16Going NudeHathaway sheds her kid-friendly image and clothes for straight-to-DVD movie Havoc. "I know people are going to focus on the fact that I'm topless in Havoc, but it was necessary for the film," she tells New York's Daily News.

I have to bring it even more."

Page Back Biography Index Anne Hathaway Biography  Anne Hathaway Biography - the wife of William Shakespeare William Shakespeare Biography - Life, times, ancestors, family, lost years, actor, Globe, playwright and worksChildren and Grandchildren Biography Judith, Hamnet, Susanna - Shakespeare, Richard and Thomas THE BIRTH OF ANNE HATHAWAYThere are few documents recording the life and biography of Anne Hathaway. Her actual date of birth is unknown but reference to  her monument (gravestone) gives her first name as Anne, and her age as sixty-seven in 1623. We are therefore able to deduce her year of birth as 1556. As William Shakespeare was born in 1564 this gave an age gap between them of eight years. This page is dedicated to piecing together the biography of Anne Hathaway, the wife of the great Bard.ANNE HATHAWAY OR AGNES HATHAWAY? THE BIOGRAPHY STARTS WITH HER PARENTSThe reference to the first name of Anne on her monument is interesting as any tracing of the possible early life of Miss Hathaway leads to a family of Richard Hathaway who were located in a village called Shottery which is about one mile from Stratford. The daughter of Richard Hathaway is identified as Agnes Hathaway. The names Anne and Agnes are legally distinct, however, it was a common custom for these names to be interchangeable. We therefore are assuming that Anne Hathaway and Agnes Hathaway are one and the same person, the daughter of Richard Hathaway. The identification of Richard Hathaway 's daughter is made in his will. Richard Hathaway died in September 1581, bequeathing her Ł6 13s 4d 'atte the day of her maryage'. Richard Hathaway owned a farmhouse in Shottery. THE EARLY LIFE OF ANNE HATHAWAY THE BIOGRAPHY BEGINS... Anne Hathaway was the eldest of the eight children of the twice-married farmer Richard Hathaway. His first three children, including Anne Hathaway, were by his first wife. His second wife was called Joan with whom he is thought to have had a further five children. Anne Hathaway and her family lived in a big farmhouse, called Hewland Farm in Shottery. Few facts are known about her early life but it can be safely assumed that she never attended any school and was illiterate.  THE UPBRINGING OF ANNE HATHAWAY - BIOGRAPHY EARLY YEARSThe girls of Anne Hathaway 's background would not have attended school or received any formal type of education. She would have  had to learn how to govern a household and become skilled in all housewifely duties. Her education would have been purely of the domestic nature in preparation for the only real career option for a girl - marriage! Single women were sometimes looked upon with suspicion. It was often the single women who were thought to be witches by their neighbours. Every woman would be expected to marry, and would be dependant on her male relatives throughout her life. At one time single women might spend their life in a convent or nunnery but due to the dissolution of the monasteries this was no longer an option. The only alternative to marriage was therefore domestic service. The married state was therefore seen as highly desirable by all women of Anne Hathaway 's social standing. With parental permission it was legal for boys to marry at 14 and girls at 12 although it was not usual for marriages at such young ages. The age of consent was 21 and boys would generally not marry until this age. Anne Hathaway would have been viewed as being in danger of being 'left on the shelf'. THE DEATH OF ANNE HATHAWAY'S FATHER, RICHARD HATHAWAYWhen Richard Hathaway died in 1581, he requested that his son, Bartholomew Hathaway move into Hewland Farm and maintain the property for his mother Joan Hathaway. Anne Hathaway would have therefore continued living in her father's home with her step-mother and brothers and sisters but the status of head of the household would have moved to her brother Bartholomew Hathaway. Hewland Farm later became known as ' Anne Hathaway's cottage '.BIOGRAPHY - THE COURTSHIP OF ANNE HATHAWAY AND WILLIAM SHAKESPEAREThe hamlet of Shottery was only a mile from the town of Stratford where William Shakespeare lived with his family. Miss Hathaway would have often visited the town and would have therefore had the opportunity to meet William Shakespeare. At this time she would have been 26 and William 18. A considerable age difference. It is apparent that Anne became pregnant prior to their betrothal or marriage which would have no doubt caused a scandal for both of the families. Shakespeare's father, in particular, would not have been pleased at the detrimental effect that the gossip would have had on his own social standing in Stratford. A hasty marriage would have been arranged between the Hathaway and Shakespeare families.HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MARRIAGE AND WEDDING From the will of her late father it seems that Anne Hathaway brought a dowry to the marriage. A dowry was an amount of money, goods, and property that the bride would bring to the marriage. It was also referred to as her marriage portion. The arrangements for the wedding of Anne Hathaway and William Shakespeare would have been with the local church. Weddings were always a religious ceremony, conducted by a minister. There were no Registry Office marriages or marriages conducted by a Justice of the Peace. The first stage was Crying the Banns, announcing a couples intention to marry. The same procedure still applies to Church marriages in England today. The intention to marry must be announced in the church three times on three consecutive Sundays or holy days. This allows time for any objections to be raised or pre-contracts to be discovered. Any marriage not published before hand was considered clandestine and illegal. An alternative, faster, route to legalising a marriage required a marriage bond which acted as security and proof to a bishop that the issue of a marriage licence was lawful with a sworn statement that there were no pre-contracts. The existence of a marriage bond would require only one reading of the Banns. HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS OF THE MARRIAGEThe recordings in the episcopal register at Worcester on November 27th 1582 and November 27th 1582 show that William Shakespeare wanted to marry a girl named Anne. The confusion begins. Each day has a different entry.November 27th 1582 the issue of a marriage license to one Wm Shakespeare stating the following: Anno Domini 1582...Novembris...27 die eiusdem mensis. Item eodem die supradicto emanavit Licentia inter Wm Shaxpere et Annam Whateley de Temple Grafton.On 28 November, 1582, two husbandmen of Stratford, named Sandells and Richardson, became sureties for Ł40 in the consistory court of Worcester to free the bishop from liability in case of lawful impediment, by pre-contract or consanguinity, to the marriage of William Shagspeare and Anne Hathwey which might proceed hereupon with only one publication of banns. The episcopal register records the marriage bond granted to one Wm Shakespeare stating that the condition of this obligation is such that if hereafter there shall not appear any lawful let or impediment by reason of any precontract, consanguinity, affinity or by any other lawful means whatsoever, but that William Shagspere on the one party and Anne Hathwey of Stratford in the diocese of Worcester, maiden, may lawfully solemnize matrimony together, and in the same afterwards remain and continue like man and wife according unto the laws in that behalf provided... The documents apparently refer to two women; Anne Whateley of Temple Grafton and Anne Hathwey of Stratford. The interpretation of these documents have led to all sorts of speculation. Was Shakespeare involved with two women, both called by the same first name?  Did he intend to marry Miss Whateley but as soon as the license was issued did Miss Hathaway intervene saying that she was pregnant? Did he really love Miss Whateley but  was forced to marry Miss Hathwey due to her pregnancy? Or was the name simply entered incorrectly on the first document? There is no way that this mystery can be solved. We know that the documents exist. We also know that as William Shakespeare was under the age of consent that his father would have had to agree to the marriage. We know that the marriage bond via the Bishop would have enabled Anne Hathaway and William to marry more quickly than the conventional route via Reading of the Banns at the local church. And we of course know that William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway.BIOGRAPHY - THE MARRIAGE OF ANNE HATHAWAY AND WILLIAM SHAKESPEAREWilliam Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway were granted a marriage licence by the Bishop of Worcester. They were married at Temple Grafton, a village approximately five miles (8 km) from Stratford. The details of the wedding of Anne Hathaway and William Shakespeare are not, of course, known for sure. We do however know a little of the traditional Elizabethan wedding for a man of Shakespeare's social standing.  Wedding invitations were not issued. People lived in small communities and knew what was happening in their neighbourhood. If there was a wedding then people would just attend. The bride did not wear white, this was a later tradition. Instead she would wear her best gown, or even a new gown if the money was available. Fresh flowers were central to the celebrations. The bride would wear flowers in her on and they would also adorn her gown. It was also traditional to carry a bouquet. A bride would have bridesmaids and these would be similarly attired. A bridal procession would move from the family's house to the church. This was a particularly festive event and the procession would be accompanied by musicians. Once at the church the ceremony would be a solemn one. In Elizabethan times everyone would stand as there were no pews in the churches. When the marriage ceremony was over the procession would return to their homes. The families of the couple would sometimes enjoy a wedding feast and were wished a long and happy life. It is, of course, possible that due to the necessity of such a hasty ceremony that the marriage between Anne Hathaway and William Shakespeare would have been a very quiet one.HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - ANNE SHAKESPEARE MOVES TO HENLEY STREET, STRATFORDAfter her marriage to Shakespeare, as was the custom, she left her home at Hewland Farm to live with William in John Shakespeare's house on Henley Street. Six months after the marriage, in May 1583, Anne and William became the parents of Susanna Shakespeare. The baptism of Susanna Shakespeare was conducted on May 26, in Stratford Parish Church. William probably helped with his father's businesses during this time and possibly also took work as a teacher and perhaps even worked with a lawyer. Ann would have shared the household chores with her mother-in-law Mary and cared for the baby Susanna. The house would have been full of various members of the family. William's father, John Shakespeare, had at one time run quite a prosperous business and had gained a high standing in the Stratford community but this was in a decline.  HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - LIFE FOR ANNE IN HENLEY STREET, STRATFORDAnne became pregnant again and Ann and William's twins, Hamnet and Judith, were born two years after Susanna. On February 2nd  1585 the baptism of Hamnet and Judith Shakespeare was celebrated. Anne would have been 28 years old and William 21. The twins were named after two very close friends of William and Anne, the baker Hamnet Sadler and his wife, Judith. The Sadlers became the godparents of the twins and, in 1589, they in turn named their own son William. Despite the arrival of more children, and his coming of age, William still did not have a real career and the Shakespeare family fortunes were still in the decline.  Anne, William and the children continued to live with Shakespeare's parents. Sharing the house on Henley Street with her in-laws must have caused some difficulties on occasions, especially with some of the problems that John Shakespeare was experiencing at the time. The family struggled on but in 1586 her father-in-law John Shakespeare was  removed from the Board of Aldermen. In 1589 William Shakespeare was named, with his parents, in a legal action against a neighbour called John Lambert. The case was over a dispute about some land in Wilmcote. HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE LEAVES STRATFORD FOR LONDONThere is speculation that it was about this time that William might have offended Sir Richard Lucy by poaching a deer on his grounds. What with this, and what with the general misfortunes of the family, William left his young family and Stratford to seek his fortune in London. Acting troupes regularly visited the town of Stratford and this would have been a major form of entertainment. It is likely that William Shakespeare knew Will Kempe and possible that Shakespeare went to London with a troupe of actors when he left Stratford between 1585 and 1592. The rest, as they say, is history.HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - ANNE NEVER MOVES FROM STRATFORD Life continued for Anne with her children and in-laws in Henley Street. She never moved away from Stratford in the whole of her life. William, meanwhile in London, had started to become a success as a poet and was also making his name as an actor and playwright in the theatres of London. He occasionally returned home to see his wife and the family. He still kept an interest in the family businesses. HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - A WORRYING TIMEBy 1592 William was mixing with the elite of the literary and theatrical worlds. But the role of a playwright was still not viewed as a creditable occupation. It could, in fact , be a very dangerous one as plays could be used as vehicles for propaganda. The State understood the power of plays. Therefore, all plays that were to be printed had to be registered, which ensured a form of censorship. Shake-speare never published any of his plays during his lifetime.  Henry VI Part 1 is produced by Strange's Men at the Rose Theatre in London. And William comes in for some criticism as a writer. Robert Greene, the author, complains about Shakespeare as an "upstart crow" in the Groatsworth of Wit. This must have been most unsettling for Anne. Being illiterate, Anne and the rest of Shakespeare's family, would have held the written word in some esteem. They would have been appalled that a criticism of William had been put into print. His first play had just been produced and the family would have been concerned that William might get involved with political and religious propaganda. They would have been only too aware that this particular road could lead to the Tower of London. An exciting time for William but a worrying time for Anne.THE PLAGUE HITS LONDONAlthough some doubts may have lingered with Anne and his family, William was clearly making his name in London society. The aristocrats, courtiers and nobles of the Realm were his friends. In 1594 he would even play before the Queen in the banqueting hall at Whitehall. So William's success in the theatre was getting well underway when in 1593 there was a setback. A devastating outbreak of the plague hit London and all of the theatres were shut. It is possible that William and his acting troupe moved out of the city to produce plays in the provinces. It seems reasonable to assume that William would have visited Anne and the children at this time. William and Anne did not have any more children. It was very unusual for couples only to have 3 children during the Elizabethan era as there was such a high mortality rate amongst children. Large families were the norm. William Shakepeare was enjoying the life of a single man in London and the time spent with Anne would have been minimal. The marriage between Anne and William might have suffered. William however was making his name as a poet and in 1593 his poem, Venus and Adonis, was registered. Poets, as opposed to playwrights, were held in high esteem. And by 1594 the outbreak of the plague had subsided and the London theatres re-opened.HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - THE SUCCESSFUL HUSBANDWilliam continued his life in London in 1594 and more plays were produced including the second part of Henry IV, Titus Andronicus and the Comedy of Errors. William also registered another poem, the Rape of Lucrece. His reputation as an actor and writer was increasing. Anne had a successful husband. The popularity of plays continued but the reputation of the theatres received a blow. In 1596 the London authorities banned the public presentation of plays within the city limits of London. New theatres were built just outside the city limits. The authorities may have disliked this new form of entertainment but the people of London loved it.  HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - TRAGEDY FOR ANNE AND WILLIAM SHAKESPEAREIn 1596 the Shakespeare family continued to prosper. But the good fortune came to an untimely and abrupt end when, in August, their son Hamnet died at the age of just eleven years. There is no documentation which records the cause of Hamnet's death but it is highly likely that he died of the plague, which had wreaked so much devastation in London 6 months before. Hamnet was buried in Stratford. HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - PRESTIGE FOR ANNE - THE SHAKESPEARE COAT OF ARMSThe financial affairs of Anne's father-in-law, John, improved as did his standing in the community. His rise in fortunes were no doubt effected by the success of his son William. John Shakespeare had again applied to the College of Heralds for a Coat-of-Arms and this time it was granted. The Coat-of-Arms and crest would have brought considerable prestige to the whole of the Shakespeare family. The formal description or blazoning of the coat of arms was detailed as gold with a black banner bearing a silver spear. The motto was "Non sans droit" or "not without right". This description would have been used to design a crest. John and his sons were then entitled to put "gentleman" after their name, they were officially part the Gentry. This title was reserved for those who were below knights but who had been granted the right to bear arms. The coat-of-arms could be displayed on their door and all their personal items. This right would have therefore also provided Anne with a considerable amount of prestige in the community. HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - THE SHAKESPEARES STANDING IN THE STRATFORD COMMUNITYAnne's standing in the Stratford community continued to rise through the fortunes of her husband, William. Although William continued with his life based in London he clearly saw Stratford as his home. On May 4th 1597 William Shakespeare purchased New Place, the second largest house in Stratford, for Ł60 together with two cottages and two barns. Anne at last had her own household. The house was impressive building, the only house that was made of brick, with a courtyard at the front, and barns, spacious gardens and orchards at the rear. Also in 1598 William is mentioned as among the chief holders of corn and malt in Stratford. He was clearly a man of considerable importance in the Stratford community. He extended his business in London as a member of the company who financed the building of the Globe Theatre. He therefore became entitled to a 'cut' of the profits. His plays continued to be produced and his personal wealth increased. In 1602 Shakespeare bought land in Stratford for Ł320, a considerable sum of money in the Elizabethan era. It was an estate consisting of 107 acres in the open fields of Old Stratford, together with a farm-house, garden and orchard, 20 acres of pasture and common rights. The standing of Anne Shakespeare in the town and surrounding districts of Stratford continued to increase. The properties owned by her husband would have required servants including a gardener. Her responsibilities as the wife of Shakespeare would have substantially increased. HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - ANNE SHAKESPEARE WITNESSES GREAT CHANGESIn 1601 (probably the year Hamlet was composed) Shakespeare's father died. The Essex rebellion fails, leaving Essex and Shakespeare's patron Southampton condemned to death in the tower. A sad time for William. In 1603 yet again the plague ravages London in 1603. The death toll is frightening and 33,000 people die. Another great tragedy strikes the nation when Queen Elizabeth dies on the 24th March 1603. James the VI of Scotland, the son of Mary Queen of Scots, became the new monarch, known in England as King James I. The new King also enjoys the theatre and William becomes a member of the King's Men acting troupe. Her husband's wealth was increasing due to his activities in the theater in London and the patronage of the King but he continued to invest in his businesses in Stratford. In 1605 William spent another Ł440 in the outstanding term of a lease of certain great tithes in Stratford parish, which brought in an income of about Ł60 a year. The country was unsettled and Anne, together with the rest of the nation would have received news of The Gunpowder Plot with the arrest and gruesome execution of Guy Fawkes.  HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - A WEDDING, A BIRTH AND A FUNERALIt's the year of 1607 and Anne and William's daughter Susanna announces her betrothal to Dr. John Hall. Anne would have been making preparations for the wedding . Dr. Hall had settled in Stratford around 1600, where he had founded a prosperous medical practice and became one of the town's leading citizens. The wedding would have been the talk of Stratford and most of the town would have attended the wedding. The wedding took place on June 5th 1607.  Eight months later Susanna gave birth to a daughter. Elizabeth Hall, Shakespeare's granddaughter, was baptised on February 21, 1608. Mary Shakespeare, Anne's mother-in-law, lived to see the birth of her great-grandchild but died in September 1608 at the grand age of sixty-eight. The burial of William Shakespeare's mother took place on September 9th 1608.HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - 1609 TO 1609Anne was probably experiencing the happiest time of her life. William was successful and had provided a wonderful home for her. His reputation was continuously being enhanced by the production of plays such as The Winter's Tale, Macbeth, and The Tempest and performing before King James I and his court. Anne was enjoying the status of being a member of the wealthiest family in Stratford. And she was also able to enjoy sharing in the upbringing of her granddaughter, Elizabeth. RETIREMENT FOR WILLIAM SHAKESPEAREIn 1610, with his fortune made and his reputation as the leading English dramatist unchallenged, Shakespeare appears to have retired to Stratford.  Anne had her husband home at last. His business interests took him to back to London on occasion but the majority of his time is spent at home. He would have been able to enjoy life with his family including his daughters and granddaughter, Elizabeth.1616 - THE FINAL YEAR FOR WILLIAM SHAKESPEAREOn January 25th 1616 William Shakespeare drafts his will. The decision to draft the will was perhaps due to his advancing years and possibly his declining health.  It could have been due to the change in his daughter's Judith's circumstances and her intention to marry. Anne and William's daughter Judith married Thomas Quiney, a vintner and tavern owner from Stratford, on February 10th 1616. This did not turn into a happy event as a scandal erupted over Thomas Quiney. The initial approval of the marriage quickly changed with the scandalous news that Thomas Quiney had made another girl pregnant. Anne must have been desperately worried about Judith. The scandal would have spread through Stratford. It then appeared that Quiney did not receive the special licence necessary for a wedding during lent before his marriage. The situation was really serious and on  March 12th Judith and Thomas were excommunicated. William must have been mortified with the turn of events. He summoned his lawyer and promptly modifies and signs his will on March 25th 1616.  The modification of the will was to ensure that Judith would receive a sum of money (Ł300) inherited in her own name. Shakespeare would leave the bulk of his fortune to his daughter, Susanna. On March 26th, to the shame of Anne and William Shakespeare, Quiney was prosecuted for 'carnal copulation' with a woman named Margaret Wheeler, who had died in childbirth that month along with her baby. Quiney confessed and was sentenced to perform public penance. His penalty, however, was commuted to a small fine of five shillings and private penance.THE DEATH OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARENo one can possibly no the true effect of this scandal on William and Anne. Shakespeare did, however, draft his will in January of 1616. Perhaps he was unwell. There are no records or documented evidence which throws any light as to the health of Shakespeare in 1616. The strain of the scandal surrounding Judith would not have helped. Williams son-in-law, Dr. John Hall, oversees his final days and treatment. And in April 1616 William Shakespeare dies. (The exact date or cause of death is unknown but it seems fitting that he died on April 23rd April, the same approximate date of his birth, on St. George's Day, the patron Saint of England). The funeral of William Shakespeare was on April 25th 1616  when he was buried in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford. Anne, of course, would have been the chief mourner supported by the family of William Shakespeare.ANNE HATHAWAY SHAKESPEARE & THE WILL OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEAREThe only mention that Shakespeare specifically makes of his wife was to leave her his "second best bed." This is probably the most famous entry of any last will and testament. To bequeath such an item sounds totally ungenerous. It is, however, understood that it would have been Anne's right, through English Common Law, to one-third of William's estate as well as residence for life at New Place.HATHAWAY BIOGRAPHY - ANNE - HER LAST YEARSThe last years of Anne's life were spent living as a widow at New Place in Stratford. In November 1616 her daughter Judith Quiney gave birth to a son and named him Shakespeare Quiney in memory of her dead father, William Shakespeare. The happiness that the baby gave to Anne and the family was short lived as Shakespeare Quiney died the following May at just six months old. Anne lived to see the birth of two more grandchildren when Judith gave birth to Richard Quiney in 1617 and Thomas Quiney two years later in 1619.BIOGRAPHY - THE DEATH OF ANNE HATHAWAY SHAKESPEAREAnne Hathaway, wife of the great Bard, died in 1623 at the age of sixty-seven. Her funeral was on August 6, 1623 and she was buried next to William Shakespeare in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford.

Birth Name: Anne Jacqueline HathawayBirth Place: Brooklyn, NYDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 11/12/1982, ScorpioProfession: Actor
After performing on stage as a child, the multitalented Hathaway landed a part on the short-lived 1999 sitcom Get Real. But it was her royal role as a quick but klutzy teen in Garry Marshall's The Princess Diaries that turned the young beauty into box-office gold. Shuttling between college, the stage and the big screen, she showed off her effervescent charm in a succession of movies (including a Princess sequel) but abandoned her squeaky-clean image with her critically acclaimed topless turn in 2005's Brokeback Mountain as the wife of a gay cowboy. In 2006's The Devil Wears Prada, she held her own opposite her idol Meryl Streep, and the following year, she portrayed Jane Austen in Becoming Jane. Hathaway's work in Rachel Getting Married in 2008 won her critical praise and a number of award nominations. But while her professional life continued to soar, her personal life faltered when her longtime boyfriend, real-estate developer Raffaello Follieri, was arrested on fraud charges. She bounced back from the traumatic experience, later taking up with actor Adam Shulman, and continuing her Hollywood hot streak with such films as 2010's Valentine's Day and Alice in Wonderland.Anne Hathaway Fast Facts:
