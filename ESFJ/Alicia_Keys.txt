She released her fifth album, Girl on Fire, in November 2012, which became Keys' fifth chart-topping album in the United States.
Throughout her career, Keys has won numerous awards and sold over 35 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide.[8] Billboard magazine named her the top R&B songs artist of the 2000s decade. In 2010, VH1 included Keys on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[9] Billboard magazine placed her number ten on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years.[10]
Keys was born Alicia Augello Cook on January 25, 1981, in the Hell's Kitchen area of Manhattan, in New York City.[11][12][13] She is the only child of Teresa Augello, a paralegal and part-time actress, and Craig Cook, a flight attendant.[14][15][16][17] Keys' mother is of half Italian and half English/Irish/Scottish descent,[18] and Keys' father is African American;[19] Keys has expressed that she was comfortable with her biracial heritage because she felt she was able to "relate to different cultures".[12][20] Her parents separated when she was two and she was subsequently raised by her mother during her formative years in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan.[21] In 1985, Keys made an appearance on The Cosby Show at the age of four, where she and a group of girls played the parts of Rudy Huxtable's sleepover guests in the episode "Slumber Party".[22][23] Throughout her childhood, Keys was sent to music and dance classes by her mother.[24] She began playing the piano when she was seven and learned classical music of composers such as Beethoven, Mozart and Chopin.[14] Keys enrolled in the Professional Performing Arts School at the age of 12, where she majored in choir and began writing songs at the age of 14.[15][25] She graduated in four years as valedictorian at the age of 16.[26]
In 1994, Keys met long-term manager Jeff Robinson after she enrolled in his brother's after-school program.[27] The following year Robinson introduced Keys to her future A&R at Arista Records, Peter Edge, who later described his first impressions to HitQuarters: "I had never met a young R&B artist with that level of musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only to be part of hip-hop, but also to go way beyond that."[28] Edge helped Robinson create a showcase for Keys and also got involved in developing her demo material. He was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company. Keys signed to Columbia Records soon after.[28] At the same time as signing a recording contract with Columbia Records, Keys was accepted into Columbia University. At first, Keys attempted to manage both, but after a month, she dropped out of college to pursue her musical career full-time.[26][29]
Keys signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and So So Def Recordings, where she appeared on the label's Christmas album performing "The Little Drummer Girl". She also co-wrote and recorded a song titled "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.[29] The song was Keys' first professional recording; however, it was never released as a single and her record contract with Columbia ended after a dispute with the label. Keys was unhappy with the label because her career had stalled during her two years under contract at Columbia due to executive indecision over her direction and major changes within the company.[28] Keys called Clive Davis, who sensed a "special, unique" artist from her performance and signed her to Arista Records, which later disbanded.[11][12] Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. Keys felt that name represented her both as a performer and person.[30] Following Davis to his newly formed J Records label, she worked with Kerry "Krucial" Brothers and recorded the songs "Rock wit U" and "Rear View Mirror", which were featured on the soundtracks to the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively.[31][32]
"Fallin'" is a gospel-influenced piano ballad.[33] Often considered her signature song, it describes the "ins and outs" of being in a relationship.[34]
Keys' first studio album Songs in A Minor was released in June 2001. Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&B, soul and jazz album.[35] Jane Stevenson of Jam! described the music as "old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals".[36] USA Today's Steve Jones wrote that Keys "taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk".[37] Debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 236,000 units, it went on to sell over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 12 million copies internationally.[38][39] Additionally, it was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[40][41] Songs in A Minor established Keys' popularity both inside and outside of the United States where she became the best-selling new artist of the year.[3]
The album's release was preceded by the April release of her debut single "Fallin'" which spent six weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.[42] The album's second single, "A Woman's Worth", was released in February 2002 and peaked at seven on the Hot 100 and number three on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; becoming her second top ten single on both charts.[43] Released in June, "How Come You Don't Call Me" served as the album's third single, peaking at 59 on the Hot 100. The album's fourth single "Girlfriend" was released in the United Kingdom where it peaked at 82. The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.
Songs in A Minor led Keys to win five awards at the 2002 Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for "Fallin'", Best New Artist, and Best R&B Album; "Fallin'" was also nominated for Record of the Year. Keys became the second female solo artist to win five Grammy Awards in a single night, following Lauryn Hill at the 41st Grammy Awards.[44] That same year, she collaborated with Christina Aguilera for the latter's upcoming album Stripped on a song titled "Impossible", which Keys wrote, co-produced, and provided with background vocals.[45] During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.[14]

"If I Ain't Got You" became the first single by a female artist to remain on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for over a year.[50][51][52][53][54] Keys also collaborated with recording artist Usher on the song "My Boo" from his 2004 album, Confessions (Special Edition). The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for three weeks, became her first number-one single in Hot 100 since 2001's "Fallin'".

The title derived from one of her poems, "Love and Chains" from the line: "I don't mind drinking my tears for water."[57] She said the title is the foundation of her writing because "everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question".[58] The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys made The New York Times bestseller list in 2005.[59][60] The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video "Karma".[61] Keys performed "If I Ain't Got You" and then joined Jamie Foxx and Quincy Jones in a rendition of "Georgia on My Mind", the Hoagy Carmichael song made famous by Ray Charles in 1960 at the 2005 Grammy Awards.[62] That evening, she won four Grammy Awards: Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for "If I Ain't Got You", Best R&B Song for "You Don't Know My Name", Best R&B Album for The Diary of Alicia Keys, and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals" for "My Boo" with Usher.[63]

Simply titled Unplugged, the album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with 196,000 units sold in its first week of release.[66] The album sold one million copies in the United States, where it was certified Platinum by the RIAA, and two million copies worldwide.[14][40][67] The debut of Keys' Unplugged was the highest for an MTV Unplugged album since Nirvana's 1994 MTV Unplugged in New York and the first Unplugged by a female artist to debut at number one.[3] The album's first single, "Unbreakable", peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[68] It remained at number one on the Billboard Hot Adult R&B Airplay for 11 weeks.[69] The album's second and final single, "Every Little Bit Hurts", was released in January 2006, it failed to enter the U.S. charts.

Her grandmother had died and her family was heavily dependent on her. She felt she needed to "escape" and went to Egypt for three weeks. She explained: "That trip was definitely the most crucial thing I've ever done for myself in my life to date. It was a very difficult time that I was dealing with, and it just came to the point where I really needed to—basically, I just needed to run away, honestly. And I needed to get as far away as possible."[75][76]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          New York-born Alicia Keys began taking piano lessons at age seven at her mother's insistence. She proved to be such a prodigy that she was later accepted into he prestigious Professional Performance Arts School of Manhattan, where she majored in choir. Not only her musical talent but also her grades proved to be so exceptional that she was allowed to graduate, as valedictorian, at age 16. In 1998, she signed with Arista Records, and wrote, produced and recorded her own albums. In 1999, she left Arista to join J Records, headed by legendary music impresario Clive Davis, and her success has been meteoric. Her 2001 debut album, "Songs in A Minor," sold six million copies and garnered five Grammys. Her album "Diary" won her four more Grammys in 2005.
      Alicia's father is African-American. Alicia's mother is caucasian. Alicia's maternal grandfather was of Italian descent, and Alicia's maternal grandmother had English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.
      Before coming up with the last name Keys, she had at one point considered calling herself Alicia Wild.
      Says the child she has met that inspired her most is 13-year-old Sydnee Bush, of Savannah, Georgia (as of 2005).
      Ties with Amy Winehouse and Lauryn Hill for the most Grammys (5) won by a woman in a single year.
      Announced that she is engaged to Swizz Beatz, having been in a relationship with him since May 2009, and is also three months pregnant with their first child together (28 May 2010).
      Gave birth to her son Egypt Daoud Dean, with husband Swizz Beatz, one month prematurely at St Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in New York (14 October 2010).
      Was five months pregnant with her son Egypt when she completed "The Freedom Tour", which began in Ottawa, Canada and ended in New Orleans.
      Returned to work eight months after giving birth to her son Egypt in order to perform in "The Piano & I Tour", which began in Paris and ended in New York City.
      [on the use of women, sex and sleaze in rap/hip-hop videos] Oh my God, the [hip-hop] videos! The imagery is so awful! I just can't get with it at all. The best thing I can say about it is that sometimes you have to see that kind of stuff so as to have a more balanced view about why it's so bad.
      I love Bono. I really respect what he has done for Africa and how he has used his fame to do good in the world. I hope I can do half as much in my life.
      I believe AIDS is the most important issue we face, because how we treat the poor is a reflection of who we are as a people.
      [interview in InStyle, 9/06] My mom always said, "Don't date a guy who thinks he's prettier than you".
      I think music and socialism and politics have always gone hand in hand. As artists we used to be way more instrumental in providing a soundtrack to the heartbeat of what's going on in the world. We all don't have to think the same thing but it's important to state what we think. There is such a fear of termination of one's career if they have any intelligent thought about politics and that's messed up.
      I love my heritage! I have my mother who is an Irish-Italian, and my father who is African, so I have the taste buds of an Italian and the spice of an African.
      He's just so gifted. When God made Stevie Wonder, he just poured extra talent, extra creativity, extra everything into him.
Marvin Gaye wasn't at his best until he hit his late thirties and forties, and had he not been killed, he would only have gotten greater.
      Even when I'm singing on record there's a lot of times when I'll fight for a bit of imperfection. I might not have quite hit the note to the perfect pitch, but there was a soul in there and feeling that,to me, delivers the emotion of that moment. For me, doing a show, the excitement of singing live, and the possibility that you're not going to be perfect - that's the thrill of it.
      [on developing her early career] I moved at such a speed I tended to feel like I was on a hamster wheel and I was just running in circles. I felt a little bit encaged. I was really not happy but I didn't understand why, because here's this big dream and I'm living it, so what's wrong with me?
      I'm a very positive person, but this whole concept of having to always be nice, always smiling, always happy, that's not real. It was like I was wearing a mask. I was becoming this perfectly chiselled sculpture, and that was bad. That took a long time to understand.
      Things can be really empty in this world, and I don't just mean the music world. It can become a very meaningless place if you don't really understand: Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? To feel fulfillment and have a deeper level of understanding, personally, that is the most important thing.
      I'm very serious about my craft. I want to make the best music that people have ever heard. I want to make music that goes down from generation to generation and that people never forget.
      I've learned to love my curves, my womanliness. I used to hide it, to downplay it. But now I revel in it.

1980sA Prodigy's StartAs a preschooler, Alicia Keys is singled out for her musical ability. "Her teacher, who was very much into the arts, had Alicia singing a song from Cats – at barely 4 years old," her mother Terri Augello, a professional actress, tells Ebony in 2007. Augello gets her daughter a gig on The Cosby Show (left) in March 1985 when she is 5, and enrolls her in gymnastics, piano, and ballet. "Being a single parent raising her in the city, I tried to give her every opportunity, just so she could find out what her muse was," Augello adds.mid 1990sAlicia's BelieversKeys, 14, meets Jeff Robinson at a Harlem PAL (Police Activities League), and he becomes her trusted friend and manager. At 16, Keys attends Columbia University, but leaves her studies for a record deal with Columbia Records.

"I've known him for a really long time," she tells Ebony in 2007, though she still refuses to identify her boyfriend. "It's a beautiful thing because he's known me before all of this stuff...It's really lovely to know I have such a great catch who not only loves me for just who I am, period, end of story."2004November 04Ambassador AliciaAfter releasing Tears for Water, a collection of her poetry and unreleased lyrics and songs from albums, Keys uses her fame as an ambassador for Keep a Child Alive. She eventually helps raise $3 million for the organization that provides HIV and AIDS medicine to families in developing countries. In 2007, Keys releases How Can I Keep from Singing? (right), a collection of photographs of families and children before and after they receive retroviral treatment. "Being involved has given me a greater sense of purpose. It makes me see the power that we all have," she tells PEOPLE. 2006Alicia Acts OutKeys plays a hitwoman opposite Ben Affleck in Smokin' Aces. Three months after wrapping her big screen debut, she films The Nanny Diaries (left), where she plays Scarlett Johansson's best friend.

Born Alicia Augello Cook, the singer-songwriter, better known by her stage name Alicia Keys, began her career in entertainment with an appearance on 'The Cosby Show' at the tender age of four. But it wasn't until 2001 that she stormed onto the music scene with her debut album 'Songs in A Minor'. Since then, the three octave singer has picked up nine Grammy awards, and even written soundtracks for the seminal 'The Wire' and Bond's 'Quantum of Solace.'
Only child Keys was raised by her single mother, Nikki Augello, a part-time actress and para-legal in the area of New York City called Hell’s Kitchen. Keys began piano lessons at age 7 and Augello's dogged insistence that her daughter stick with the instrument led Keys to attend Manhattan's prestigious Professional Performance Arts School where she majored in choir. She excelled academically and was allowed to graduate at the age of 16. 
Keys had already attracted the attention of record company executives during her high school years and, after what amounted to a bidding war for her talents, she signed with Arista Records in 1998.
While she was accepted to Columbia University on a full scholarship, she only attended for four weeks before leaving to dedicate herself fully to music.In 1999, Clive Davis, the head of Arista Records, left the company to start J Records. Keys decided to follow Davis, who had engineered the careers of such soul luminaries as Aretha Franklin, to his new label. Unlike many of her pop-music contemporaries, the precocious Keys not only sings, but writes and produces her own music. At J Records, Keys found the freedom to complete her debut effort, which included material she had started work on years prior.Davis carefully orchestrated a media blitz before the release of the album, including a series of television and small venue appearances. When it was finally released, ‘Songs in A Minor’ went platinum five times over. Critics roundly praised the album not only for its musical polish, but also for its lyrical maturity.At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Keys took home awards for Song of the Year, Best R&B Song, Best R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best New Artist. Her album 'Diary' won her four Grammys in 2005. It sold in excess of 618,000 copies in its first week, a record at the time, and it went on to sell eight million copies worldwide, which made it the second biggest selling album by an R&B artist.
She then released 'As I Am' with the first single from it, 'No One', doing brisk business stateside. The album was a success and was certified Platinum three times by the Recording Industry Association of America.
In 2007, Keys made her debut film appearance as an assassin named Georgia Sykes in the crime thriller Smokin' Aces. The singer used the intense training she had to undergo for the film as a platform to train to run a marathon. She later described the feat as the 'weirdest sensation'.
Her fourth album, The Element of Freedom, was released in 2009 and was the first of Key's records to hit the number one spot in the UK Albums Chart.
Keys met her future husband, record producer Swizz Beatz, when the pair wrote and produced Million Dollar Bill for Whitney Houston's album, I Look to You. In May 2010, the couple confirmed they were engaged and were expecting a child together. Egypt Daoud Dean was born on October 14, 2010 in New York.

Barely out of her teens, singer, songwriter and classically trained pianist Alicia Keys stormed the pop charts in the early 2000s with a mature-beyond-her-age mix of soul, jazz and hip-hop. Thanks to an extra push from an appearance on Oprah the day before its release, her debut Songs in A Minor (Number One, 2001) sold 235,000 copies in its first week. By the end of the year it had produced two Top 10 singles — "Fallin' " (Number One) and "A Woman's Worth" (Number Seven) — and was still red hot. Keys wound up taking home five trophies at the following year's Grammy ceremony, including Best New Artist, Best R&B Album and Best R&B song. Songs in A Minor went on to sell platinum six times over.
She was born Alicia Augello-Cook on January 25th, 1981, in Manhattan, New York, to a white mother and a Jamaican father. Her dad left early on, and she was raised by her mother, Teresa M. Augello (a.k.a. Terria Joseph), a paralegal and part-time actress. Keys' maternal grandfather was a Detroit radio DJ and actor who appeared in the Sixties TV series The Lone Ranger  and The Green Hornet. When she was four, Keys landed a one-off role as part of a slumber party on The Cosby Show. By seven, she had become serious about music, studying piano and learning to play Beethoven, Mozart and Chopin. Keys graduated as the valedictorian from Manhattan's prestigious Professional Performing Arts School at 16 and was accepted to Columbia University but dropped out of college early to pursue her musical career.
Keys initially inked a deal with So So Def Records and in 1997 wrote and recorded a song that appeared on the soundtrack of Men in Black. The deal never resulted in an album, but, by then, Keys attracted the attention of powerful music-industry mogul Clive Davis, who signed her to his Arista Records (which later merged with the newer J Records). Keys recorded two more songs for soundtracks, and then, in June 2001, released Songs in A Minor. The album rocketed to Number One and was well-received by critics, who hailed Keys as a neo-soul successor to Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu.
Keys' late-2003 follow-up, The Diary of Alicia Keys, debuted at Number One and produced another batch of hits including "You Don't Know My Name" (Number Three, 2004), "If I Ain't Got You" (Number Four, 2004) and "Diary" (Number Eight, 2004). That year, she performed along with Beyoncé and Missy Elliott on the Verizon Ladies First Tour, and also headlined tours in Asia and Australia. The album — and a duet with Usher on "My Boo" (Number One, 2004) — earned her another eight Grammy nominations, four of which she won: Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for "If I Ain't Got You," Best R&B Song for "You Don't Know My Name," Best R&B Album and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for "My Boo." She also won Best R&B Video at both the 2004 and 2005 MTV Video Music Awards for the album's "If I Ain't Got You" and "Karma," respectively. 
Next, she dropped MTV Unplugged (Number One, 2005), on which she and Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine performed a duet of the Rolling Stones' "Wild Horses." The album didn't produce any Top 10 hits, although one of the two new songs, "Unbreakable," reached Number 34. Although it was her worst-selling album to date, selling one million copies in the U.S. and two million worldwide, it was the highest-charting Unplugged debut since Nirvana's in 1994 and was nominated for four Grammys. 
By 2006, Keys earned the attention of Bob Dylan, who mentioned her on "Thunder on the Mountain" from Modern Times: "I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't help from cryin'/ When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line."
Keys came back strong with As I Am (Number One, 2007). Selling 742,000 copies in its first week—the best first-week sales of her career—the album marked her fourth consecutive Number One debut on the Billboard 200 — a tie with Britney Spears for the most consecutive Number One debuts from a female artist. Keys took home two more Grammys in 2008 for the single "No One" (Number One, 2007): Best R&B song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. A second single, "Like You'll Never See Me Again" topped the R&B chart and reached the Top 20 of the pop chart.
Keys has sporadically appeared on other series including Charmed, in 2001, and American Dreams, in 2003. In 2007 she made her film debut in Smokin' Aces, and appeared in The Nanny Diaries later that year. In 2008, she starred The Secret Life of Bees, alongside Jennifer Hudson and Queen Latifah, earning a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture at the NAACP Image Awards. Around the same time, she teamed with Jack White to record "Another Way to Die," the theme song to Quantum of Solace, and the first-ever duet recorded for a James Bond film.
In October 2009, Keys appeared on fellow native New Yorker Jay-Z's "Empire State of Mind," a love song to the Big Apple and the wildly successful first single from the rapper's Blueprint 3 album. Keys and Jay-Z performed the track at MTV Video Music Awards and the American Music Awards, helping to push it to Number One on Billboard's Hot 100.
The song's popularity didn't seem to help sales of Keys' fourth studio album, The Element of Freedom, which dropped in December 2009 and sold 417,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at Number Two—Keys' first album not to debut at Number One. The album's first single, "Doesn't Mean Anything," peaked at No. 60 on Billboard's Hot 100. Many critics applauded the album's more mellow, low-key vibe and Prince-worthy synths, but the lack of a knockout single left consumers cool.

Personal InformationBorn on January 21, 1981, in New York, NY; daughter of Terri Augello, a paralegal and occasional actress, and Craig Cook, a flight attendant.Education: Graduated high school from Manhattan's Professional Performance Arts School; attended Columbia University.
Life's WorkJust three weeks after being released, Alicia Keys's debut album, Songs in A Minor, was certified triple platinum. Suddenly you couldn't open a magazine, turn on the radio, or tune into MTV without encountering the stunning biracial Keys. With her classical training on the piano, soul-stirring lyrics, and heart-stopping voice, Keys had become a bona fide superstar. Not just another pretty face singing catchy pop, Keys wrote most of the lyrics and music, played all of the instruments, and co-produced the album. Of Songs in A Minor Keys told Worldpop.com, "[it's] a journey through my life from the time when I was 14, when I wrote the first song on the album.... All the things I went through, and experienced.... That's where the title comes from as well, A Minor is one of my favorite keys to plays in, and A is the first letter of my name so it really just talks about songs from me." The album eventually won the artist five Grammy Awards. And her fame was solidified and proven real with the release of her second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, which debuted at number one on the Billboard Top 200 Albums list and garnered the artist six more Grammy Awards.Music Before EverythingKeys was born on January 21, 1981, in New York City to an Italian-American mother and an African-American father. Her parents did not stay together and Keys was raised by her mother, Terri Augello, a paralegal and sometimes actress. As a child, Keys didn't see much of her father, Craig Cook, however, they remained on good terms. Despite the difficult life of a single mom and the poverty in which she often struggled, Keys's mother was determined to nourish her child's budding passion for music and enrolled Keys in piano classes. Keys told Rolling Stone, "I've had a deep love for music since I was four... . Music came before everything, everything, everything. I would risk everything for it." Despite her commitment, Keys was aware of the financial strain the lessons put on her mother's meager salary and once begged to quit. "But my mom would tell me, 'Quit what you like, but you're not quitting piano.' She didn't care what it cost," Keys told Newsweek. With her mother's support, Keys learned classical piano by the time she was seven. At eleven she began writing songs.For her high school education Keys was accepted into the prestigious Professional Performance Arts School in Manhattan where she majored in Choir and continued her piano lessons. After school she worked on her voice at a local Police Athletic League girls' club. At the same time, Keys's manager, Jeff Robinson, began booking Keys at music-industry shows. "We wanted people to see that I played piano and sang," she told Rolling Stone. Keys's life became a whirlwind of studying and singing, practicing piano, and performing onstage. At school her academic talents soon paid off. At age 16, Keys graduated early and was promptly accepted to Columbia University. At just about the same time, her musical talents also began to reap rewards and Keys found herself in a bidding war between major record companies. In the end Keys signed a deal with Columbia Records. Used to juggling both academics and music, Keys decided to stick with both Colombia's. However, just four weeks into her freshman year, Keys walked away from the university. "I couldn't be in the studio at night and keep up with class," she told Rolling Stone.Waited and WaitedHer decision to quit school soon seemed questionable as industry red-tape at Columbia Records began to ensnarl Keys. She managed to score some recording time and was even given a black baby grand piano by the label, yet her talent languished. "I felt that they wanted me to be a clone of Mariah (Carey) or Whitney (Houston), and I couldn't do that. I'm not the sequined dress type, or the high-heeled type, or the all-cleavage type. I'm not coming like that for no one," she told Newsweek.When the deal with Columbia finally fell through, the legendary music producer and president of Arista Records, Clive Davis, stepped in. Responsible for the careers of musical powerhouses such as Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, and Santana, Davis knew Keys was special the first time he saw her perform. "[It was] at a Christmas showcase when she was just seventeen," Davis told Rolling Stone, "I was struck immediately by her voice and beauty--it was stunning. She had everything that an artist can want." Keys was just as smitten with Davis. "Clive was the only executive that ever asked me, how do I see myself, how do I see my career. When he asked me that question, I knew immediately that's where I had to be... .What he sees for me, I see for myself," Keys told The Daily Telegraph.At Arista with Davis's support, Keys finally began to record her album. However, just as Songs in A Minor was nearing completion in 1998, Davis was ousted from Arista and Keys was put on hold again. In classic Keys style she put this setback in perspective and learned something from it. She told Rolling Stone, "[i]t built my character and tested my confidence, gave me patience and better prepared me for the whole game." By 1999, Davis had formed his own label, J Records, and Keys promptly signed on as one of the label's first acts. After years of false starts and record industry mayhem, Keys was finally able to record her first album. Keys, however, was not frustrated by the delays. As she told www.mtv.com, "Ultimately, what is four years in an entire lifetime? That's the outlook I like to take on it. Nothing before its time. And the time is now. Believe that!"Made a Major DebutSongs in A Minor debuted at number one on the Billboard Album Chart and both the record industry and the music-loving public took notice. The first single on the album, "Fallin'," immediately went into heavy rotation on both the pop and the R&B radio stations. The album is a fresh mix of old and new, mostly R&B with a strong dose of hip-hop and a splash of jazz improvisations, all wrapped up with a classically-trained musician's sensibility. "I was born in Hell's Kitchen and spent a lot of time in Harlem, and I was exposed to a lot of different types of music, from Biggie (rapper Notorious B.I.G.) to Nirvana to Miles Davis to Nina Simone and back to classical," Keys told USA Today. "I think it was inevitable that I merge all of them I do now."As the album held tight at the top of the charts, Keys began a dizzying schedule of tours, benefit appearances, photo shoots, and interviews. She became an MTV regular, performed at awards shows, and appeared on late night talk shows. Fan sites blossomed on the web. She bagged an MTV Music Award and scored five nominations for the 2002 American Music Awards, far outdistancing her nearest rival. Keys had become the music industry's new "it" girl. Not only could she sing, play piano, and write music, but she was also heart-achingly gorgeous.Being Alicia KeysEven though Keys had been training as a performer, singer, and songwriter nearly her entire life, her seemingly overnight explosion onto the music scene A-list had some crediting her success to Davis and his infamous hype machine. Just before the album debuted, Davis sent Oprah Winfrey a personal letter asking for Keys to appear on an episode of Oprah. While it is true that Davis is one of the few music industry insiders with the power to get Oprah's personal attention, it was the music that convinced Oprah and her crew to book Keys. For her part, Keys dismissed not only those that blamed her new fame on the hype surrounding her, but she also dismissed the hype itself. "I just have to continue doing what I've always done, and that is be who I am... . It's just Alicia. I like to be onstage, I like to write music, I like to make music. And that's really what the point is," she told MTV.com.In 2003 Keys released her second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys. The album quickly reached the same level of success as the first one and was nominated for a Grammy award for Album of the Year, among others, and the song "If I Ain't Got You" was nominated for Song of the Year. The Diary of Alicia Keys eventually won six Grammy Awards total. With her success firmly established, in February of 2005 Keys was asked to sing "America the Beautiful" before the Super Bowl XXXIX in Florida, an honor which the young singer was happy to accept.In April of that 2004 Keys decided that she wanted to do something good with all the fame she had and joined the nonprofit group Frum the Ground Up to help teens with self esteem and goal making. During her tour to promote her album The Diary of Alicia Keys, she visited an inner-city Chicago middle school to discuss the importance of having and following one's dreams. She had plans to visit schools in Atlanta, Washington DC, and New York City as well. Looking for other ways to get out the message that anyone could achieve their dreams if they only believed in themselves and worked hard, Keys teamed up with the WE Network for another cause. PR Newswire announced that Keys would be taking part in a new Women's Entertainment (WE) program, WE Empowers Women, an organization "supporting health, education and mentorship programs designed specifically to address and support the modern lives of women and their families." The show began airing October 1, 2005.In June of 2004 Keys published her first book of poetry, called Tears for Water: Songbook of Poems and Lyrics. The book includes lyrics from her famous songs as well as poems from her journals and notebooks. After some of the poems she clues readers into what she was feeling and thinking at the time she wrote them.In October of 2005 Keys released her third album, Alicia Keys: Unplugged. Critics lauded the album as being one that highlighted the excellence of Keys' voice and melodies. Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine said of the album, "Alicia Keys' "Unplugged" is that rare album where an artist not only capably demonstrates her well-entrenched poise and ease, but reveals more warmth than in the confines of a studio." The album was her third to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 Album Chart. She was the first woman to have her MTV Unplugged album debut at the number one spot on the charts. And Keys was looking for other ways to expand her artistic skills. In 2006 Keys was scheduled to appear in the movie Smoking Aces as a killer, a role that should stretch the music star's skills in a large way.

 Just three weeks after being released in the summer of 2001, Alicia Keys's debut album, Songs in A Minor, was certified triple platinum. Suddenly you couldn't open a magazine, turn on the radio, or tune into MTV without encountering the stunning Keys. With her classical training on the piano, soul-stirring lyrics, and heart-stopping voice, Keys had become a bona fide superstar. Not just another pretty face singing catchy pop, Keys wrote most of the lyrics and music, played all of the instruments, and coproduced the album. Although critics hailed her first album for its unique blend of classical and soul music, Keys herself was more modest about her innovative approach to music. As she told Margena A. Christian in Jet, "I really didn't know that I was doing it. It was kind of something that comes natural to me, studying classical for so long and having a love of soul and R&B music. It's just kind of something that fused together by itself." Keys won no less than five Grammy Awards for Songs in A Minor, and she proved her staying power by following up with the hugely successful The Diary of Alicia Keys at the end of 2003. Like her debut, this album landed in the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart in the first week of its release.
Keys was born Alicia Augello Cook on January 21, 1981, in New York City to an Italian-American mother and an African-American father. Her parents did not stay together and Keys was raised by her mother, Terri Augello, a paralegal and aspiring actress. As a child, Keys didn't see much of her father, Craig Cook, however, they remained on good terms. Despite the difficult life of a single mom and the poverty in which she often struggled, Keys's mother was determined to nourish her child's budding passion for music and enrolled Keys in piano classes. Keys told Rolling Stone, "I've had a deep love for music since I was four…. Music came before everything, everything, everything. I would risk everything for it." Despite her commitment, Keys was aware of the financial strain the lessons put on her mother's meager salary and once begged to quit. "But my mom would tell me, 'Quit what you like, but you're not quitting piano.' She didn't care what it cost," Keys told Newsweek. With her mother's support, Keys learned classical piano by the time she was seven. At eleven she began writing songs.For her high school education Keys was accepted into the prestigious Professional Performance Arts School in Manhattan where she majored in Choir and continued her piano lessons. After school she worked on her voice at a local Police Athletic League girls' club. At the same time, Keys's manager, Jeff Robinson, began booking Keys at music industry shows. "We wanted people to see that I played piano and sang," she told Rolling Stone. Keys's life became a whirlwind of studying and singing, practicing piano, and performing onstage. At school her academic talents soon paid off.
At age 16, Keys graduated early and was promptly accepted to Columbia University. At just about the same time, her musical talents also began to reap rewards and Keys found herself in a bidding war between major record companies. In the end Keys signed a deal with Columbia Records. Used to juggling both academics and music, Keys decided to stick with both Columbias. However, just four weeks into her freshman year, Keys walked away from the university. "I couldn't be in the studio at night and keep up with class," she told Rolling Stone.
Her decision to quit school soon seemed questionable as industry red tape at Columbia Records began to ensnarl Keys. She managed to score some recording time and was even given a black baby grand piano by the label, yet her talent languished. "I felt that they wanted me to be a clone of Mariah [Carey] or Whitney [Houston], and I couldn't do that. I'm not the sequined dress type, or the high-heeled type, or the all-cleavage type. I'm not coming like that for no one," she told Newsweek.When the deal with Columbia finally fell through, the legendary music producer and president of Arista Records, Clive Davis, stepped in. Responsible for the careers of musical powerhouses such as Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, and Santana, Davis knew Keys was special the first time he saw her perform. "[It was] at a Christmas showcase when she was just seventeen," Davis told Rolling Stone, "I was struck immediately by her voice and beauty—it was stunning. She had everything that an artist can want." Keys was just as smitten with Davis. "Clive was the only executive that ever asked me, how do I see myself, how do I see my career. When he asked me that question, I knew immediately that's where I had to be….What he sees for me, I see for myself," Keys told The Daily Telegraph.At Arista with Davis's support, Keys finally began to record her album. However, just as Songs in A Minor was nearing completion in 1998, Davis was ousted from Arista and Keys was put on hold again. In classic Keys style she put this setback in perspective and learned something from it. She told Rolling Stone, "[i]t built my character and tested my confidence, gave me patience and better prepared me for the whole game." By 1999, Davis had formed his own label, J Records, and Keys promptly signed on as one of the label's first acts. After years of false starts and record industry mayhem, Keys was finally able to record her first album. Keys, however, was not frustrated by the delays. As she told MTV.com, "Ultimately, what is four years in an entire lifetime? That's the outlook I like to take on it. Nothing before its time. And the time is now. Believe that!"
Songs in A Minor debuted at number one on the Billboard Album Chart and both the record industry and the music-loving public took notice. The first single on the album, "Fallin'," immediately went into heavy rotation on both the pop and the R&B radio stations. The album is a fresh mix of old and new, mostly R&B with a strong dose of hip-hop and a splash of jazz improvisations, all wrapped up with a classically-trained musician's sensibility. "I was born in Hell's Kitchen and spent a lot of time in Harlem, and I was exposed to a lot of different types of music, from Biggie [rapper Notorious B.I.G.] to Nirvana to Miles Davis to Nina Simone and back to classical," Keys told USA Today. "I think it was inevitable that I merge all of them."
As the album held tight at the top of the charts, Keys began a dizzying schedule of tours, benefit appearances, photo shoots, and interviews. She became an MTV regular, performed at awards shows, and appeared on late night talk shows. Fan sites blossomed on the web. She bagged five Grammys, an MTV Music Award, and scored five nominations for the 2002 American Music Awards, far outdistancing her nearest rival. Keys had become the music industry's new "it" girl. Not only could she sing, play piano, and write music, but she was also heart-achingly gorgeous.
Even though Keys had been training as a performer, singer, and songwriter nearly her entire life, her seemingly overnight explosion onto the music scene A-list had some crediting her success to Davis and his infamous hype machine. Just before the album debuted, Davis sent Oprah Winfrey a personal letter asking for Keys to appear on an episode of Oprah. While it is true that Davis is one of the few music industry insiders with the power to get Oprah's personal attention, it was the music that convinced Oprah and her crew to book Keys. For her part, Keys dismissed not only those that blamed her new fame on the hype surrounding her, but she also dismissed the hype itself. "I just have to continue doing what I've always done, and that is be who I am…. It's just Alicia. I like to be onstage, I like to write music, I like to make music. And that's really what the point is," she told MTV.com. In an industry ruled by carefully choreographed bleach-blonde teenagers in flesh-baring outfits singing prefab pop, the multitalented Keys truly stood out.As 2003 drew to a close, Keys got her chance to prove that she was no overnight flash in the pan. Her sophomore album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, like its predecessor, became an instant bestseller, topping the Billboard Top 200 chart in the first week of its release, and wowing critics and fans alike. The first single from Diary, "You Don't Know My Name," had an "old school classic soul feel," according to People reviewer Chuck Arnold. Featuring a mid-song spoken interlude, the song shot to the top of the charts immediately upon release. If her first two albums were any indication of what the future held, Keys seemed poised to dominate the music charts for a long time to come.

By mixing R&B with a sultry dose of neo-soul, Alicia Keys became an international star in 2001 with the release of her debut album. Songs in A Minor sold more than 50,000 copies during its first day of availability and eventually moved over ten million units worldwide, thus setting the stage for the 20-year-old's long career. Although she shared the charts with R&B contemporaries like Destiny's Child, Keys' talent distinguished her as a different sort of diva, one who played a variety of instruments and penned the majority of her songs without outside help. The Diary of Alicia Keys cemented her popularity two years later, and Alicia Keys spent the rest of the decade refining her now-signature sound. 
Alicia Augello Cook was born in Harlem in early 1981. Raised by her Italian-American mother, she enrolled in classical piano lessons at the age of seven and began writing songs four years later. An education at the Professional Performance Arts School helped develop her vocal skills, and Alicia graduated at the age of 16 as the class valedictorian. Two Columbias loomed on the immediate horizon: Columbia University and Columbia Records, both of whom had extended offers to the talented student/musician. Although she attempted to make both options work, Alicia found it difficult to juggle the two commitments and chose to focus exclusively on her music career. Assuming the stage name of Alicia Keys, she began working with Columbia and contributed a song to the Men in Black soundtrack, but disputes with the label resulted in her contract's termination.
Keys bounced back by aligning herself with Clive Davis, the president of Arista Records, but work on her debut album stalled when Davis was ousted from the company in 2000. Davis soon formed his own label, J Records, and welcomed Keys back into the fold with an aggressive publicity campaign (including an influential appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show). Songs in A Minor was then released in June 2001 and debuted at the top of the charts, eventually netting five Grammys and rising to platinum status in ten different countries. Released in 2003, The Diary of Alicia Keys enjoyed similar Grammy-certified success, and Keys released a book of poetry the following year. 
A live CD/DVD package, Unplugged, arrived in 2005 and followed Keys' two previous releases to the top of the charts, even if it failed to win any of the four Grammys for which it was nominated. She then entered the acting world, starring in both Smokin' Aces and The Nanny Diaries in 2007, before issuing the pop-influenced As I Am later that year. It became her fourth consecutive number one album, and she was nominated for another handful of Grammys as a result, with "Superwoman" winning the award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in early 2009. As the year drew to a close, Keys returned to the top of the Billboard charts with "Empire State of Mind," a Jay-Z single that featured her vocals, and released her fourth studio album, The Element of Freedom. Although it went platinum, The Element of Freedom didn't reach number one in the U.S., becoming her first album to miss the top slot. It did reach number one in the U.K., though, marking Keys' first chart-topping album in Europe and highlighting her status as a global artist. 
During the next two years, Keys married producer Swizz Beatz, gave birth to a son, collaborated with Eve on the single "Speechless," appeared somewhere in Kanye West's "All of the Lights," and went on a brief tour in celebration of her debut album's tenth anniversary. She wrote and, with her husband, co-produced "Angel" for Jennifer Hudson's I Remember Me. In 2012, she assisted Emeli Sandé (Our Version of Events) and Miguel (Kaleidoscope Dream) prior to releasing Girl on Fire, her fifth studio album. It was issued on RCA -- in the wake of J Records' dissolution -- that November and featured collaborations with her husband, as well as Salaam Remi, Jeff Bhasker, and John Legend. ~ Andrew Leahey & Andy Kellman, Rovi

Alicia Augello Cook (born January 25, 1981), known professionally as Alicia Keys, is an American singer-songwriter and actress. Keys released her debut album with J Records, having had previous record deals first with Columbia and then Arista Records. Keys' debut album, Songs in A Minor, was a commercial success, selling over 12 million copies worldwide.[2] She became the best-selling new artist and best-selling R&B artist of 2001.[3] The album earned Keys five Grammy Awards in 2002, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for "Fallin'".[4] Her second studio album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, was released in 2003 and was also another success worldwide, selling eight million copies.[5] The album garnered her an additional four Grammy Awards in 2005.[6] Later that year, she released her first live album, Unplugged, which debuted at number one in the United States.[7] She became the first female to have an MTV Unplugged album to debut at number one and the highest since Nirvana in 1994.[3]
Keys made guest appearances on several television series in the following years, beginning with Charmed. She made her film debut in Smokin' Aces and went on to appear in The Nanny Diaries in 2007. Her third studio album, As I Am, was released in the same year and sold five million copies worldwide, earning Keys an additional three Grammy Awards. The following year, she appeared in The Secret Life of Bees, which earned her a nomination at the NAACP Image Awards. She released her fourth album, The Element of Freedom, in December 2009, which became Keys' first chart-topping album in the United Kingdom. She released her fifth album, Girl on Fire, in November 2012, which became Keys' fifth chart-topping album in the United States.
Throughout her career, Keys has won numerous awards and has sold over 35 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide.[8] Billboard magazine named her the top R&B songs artist of the 2000s decade. In 2010, VH1 included Keys on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[9] Billboard magazine placed her number ten on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years.[10] BlackBerry (formerly RIM) named her as its Global Creative Director at the Blackberry 10 Experience event in New York City on January 30, 2013. Keys then opened Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 3, 2013, by singing the U.S. National Anthem.
Keys was born Alicia Augusta Cook on January 25, 1981, in the Hell's Kitchen area of Manhattan, in New York City.[11][12][13] She is the only child of Teresa Augello, a paralegal and part-time actress, and Craig Cook, a flight attendant.[14][15][16][17] Keys' mother is of Italian, Scottish, and Irish descent, and her father is African American;[18] Keys has expressed that she was comfortable with her biracial heritage because she felt she was able to "relate to different cultures".[12][19] Her parents separated when she was two and she was subsequently raised by her mother during her formative years in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan.[20] In 1985, Keys made an appearance on The Cosby Show at the age of four, where she and a group of girls played the parts of Rudy Huxtable's sleepover guests in the episode "Slumber Party".[21][22] Throughout her childhood, Keys was sent to music and dance classes by her mother.[23] She began playing the piano when she was seven and learned classical music of composers such as Beethoven, Mozart and Chopin.[14] Keys enrolled in the Professional Performing Arts School at the age of 12, where she majored in choir and began writing songs at the age of 14.[15][24] She graduated in four years as valedictorian at the age of 16.[25]
In 1994, Keys met long-term manager Jeff Robinson after she enrolled in his brother's after-school program.[26] The following year Robinson introduced Keys to her future A&R at Arista Records, Peter Edge, who later described his first impressions to HitQuarters: "I had never met a young R&B artist with that level of musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only to be part of hip-hop, but also to go way beyond that."[27] Edge helped Robinson create a showcase for Keys and also got involved in developing her demo material. He was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company. Keys signed to Columbia Records soon after.[27] At the same time as signing a recording contract with Columbia Records, Keys was accepted into Columbia University. At first, Keys attempted to manage both, but after a month, she dropped out of college to pursue her musical career full-time.[25][28]
Keys signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and So So Def Recordings, where she appeared on the label's Christmas album performing "The Little Drummer Girl". She also co-wrote and recorded a song entitled "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.[28] The song was Keys' first professional recording; however, it was never released as a single and her record contract with Columbia ended after a dispute with the label. Keys was unhappy with the label because her career had stalled during her two years under contract at Columbia due to executive indecision over her direction and major changes within the company.[27] Keys called Clive Davis, who sensed a "special, unique" artist from her performance and signed her to Arista Records, which later disbanded.[11][12] Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. Keys felt that name represented her both as a performer and person.[29] Following Davis to his newly formed J Records label, she worked with Kerry "Krucial" Brothers and recorded the songs "Rock wit U" and "Rear View Mirror", which were featured on the soundtracks to the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively.[30][31]
"Fallin'" is a gospel-influenced piano ballad.[32] Often considered her signature song, it describes the "ins and outs" of being in a relationship.[33]
Keys' first studio album Songs in A Minor was released in June 2001. Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&B, soul and jazz album.[34] Jane Stevenson of Jam! described the music as "old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals".[35] USA Today's Steve Jones wrote that Keys "taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk".[36] Debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 236,000 units, it went on to sell over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 12 million copies internationally.[37][38] Additionally, it was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[39][40] Songs in A Minor established Keys' popularity both inside and outside of the United States where she became the best-selling new artist of the year.[3]
The album's release was preceded by the April release of her debut single "Fallin'" which spent six weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.[41] The album's second single, "A Woman's Worth", was released in February 2002 and peaked at seven on the Hot 100 and number three on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; becoming her second top ten single on both charts.[42] Released in June, "How Come You Don't Call Me" served as the album's third single, peaking at 59 on the Hot 100. The album's fourth single "Girlfriend" was released in the United Kingdom were it peaked at 82. The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.
Songs in A Minor led Keys to win five awards at the 2002 Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for "Fallin'", Best New Artist, and Best R&B Album; "Fallin'" was also nominated for Record of the Year. Keys became the second female solo artist to win five Grammy Awards in a single night, following Lauryn Hill at the 41st Grammy Awards.[43] That same year, she collaborated with Christina Aguilera for the latter's upcoming album Stripped on a song entitled "Impossible", which Keys wrote, co-produced, and provided with background vocals.[44] During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.[14]
Keys followed up her debut with The Diary of Alicia Keys, which was released in December 2003. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 618,000 copies its first week of release, becoming the largest first-week sales for a female artist in 2003.[45] It sold 4.4 million copies in the United States and was certified four times Platinum by the RIAA.[39][46] It sold eight million copies worldwide,[47] becoming the sixth biggest-selling album by a female artist and the second biggest-selling album by a female R&B artist.[48] The album's lead single, "You Don't Know My Name", peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for eight consecutive weeks, her first Top 10 single in both charts since 2002's "A Woman's Worth". The album's second single, "If I Ain't Got You", was released in February 2004 and peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for six weeks. The album's third single, "Diary", peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, being their third consecutive Top 10 single in both charts. The album's fourth and final single, "Karma", which peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 17 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, first release to fail to achieve top ten status on both charts. "If I Ain't Got You" became the first single by a female artist to remain on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for over a year.[49][50][51][52][53] Keys also collaborated with recording artist Usher on the song "My Boo" from his 2004 album, Confessions (Special Edition).
