Wallace has won three Emmy Awards and the Dupont-Columbia Silver Baton Award. Wallace has been with Fox News since 2003. As a previous moderator of Meet the Press, Wallace is the only person to date to have served as host/moderator of more than one of the major Sunday political talk shows.[citation needed]

Wallace was born in Chicago, Illinois. He is the son of Mike Wallace, longtime CBS 60 Minutes reporter, and Norma Kaphan.[1] Both his parents were Jewish.[2][3] His parents divorced when he was one year old. He grew up with his stepfather, future CBS News President Bill Leonard.[4] He did not develop a relationship with his biological father until the age of 14.[5] Leonard gave him early exposure to political journalism, hiring him as an assistant to Walter Cronkite at the 1964 Republican National Convention.
Wallace attended The Hotchkiss School and Harvard College. He first reported news on-air for WHRB, the student radio station at Harvard. He memorably covered the 1969 occupation of University Hall by students and was detained by Cambridge police, using his one phone call to sign off a report from Cambridge City Jail.[6]
Although accepted at Yale Law School, Wallace instead took a job with The Boston Globe.[7] He says he realized he wanted to move to television when he noticed all the reporters at the 1972 political conventions were watching the proceedings on TV instead of in person. For a time in the early 1970s, he worked for Chicago CBS owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV.[8]

Wallace began his network journalism career with NBC in 1975, where he stayed for 14 years, as a reporter with WNBC-TV in New York City. Wallace then transferred to NBC's Washington bureau as a political correspondent for NBC News, and later served as Washington co-anchor for the Today show in 1982. He also served as chief White House correspondent (1982–89), moderator of Meet the Press (1987–88), and anchor of the Sunday edition of NBC Nightly News. Wallace's confrontational style was evident during President Ronald Reagan's news conference in March 1987, when Reagan admitted to dealing arms for hostages. During his questioning, Wallace asked Reagan why he had denied that Israel was involved with the arms sales to Iran "when you knew that wasn't true."[9]
Wallace left NBC in 1989 for ABC. At ABC News, Wallace was the senior correspondent for Primetime Thursday and occasionally hosted Nightline. During the first Gulf War in 1991, he reported from Tel Aviv on the Iraqi Scud missiles attacks. At the time, the Israeli Government did not want to advertise where the Scuds landed, in order to prevent the Iraqis from making adjustments to their launchers. On one episode of Nightline, Wallace started describing the location in Tel Aviv where a Scud missile landed. Nightline host Ted Koppel cut him off, and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location.[10]
After another 14 years at ABC, Wallace left in 2003 to join the Fox News Channel. He has remarked in the past that his work at Fox opened his eyes to what critics cite as bias in the mainstream press. Wallace has stated, "Fox News wouldn't exist if it weren't for this kind of stuff going on in the mainstream media. That's why people are fed up with that and want the antidote to it because they get it and they've gotten it for years - the so-called bias in the objective press."[11] Wallace began hosting Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace in 2003 after replacing Tony Snow and is an occasional guest on the Howie Carr show on Boston's WRKO.
Despite Wallace's blood relationship with his father Mike, his stepfather Bill Leonard had far more of an impact, Wallace stating that Leonard was "the single most important person in my life."[13] Chris Wallace first developed a relationship with his father in his teens, after his older brother Peter died in 1962 climbing a mountain in Greece.[14]
In 1973, he married Elizabeth Farrell with whom he has four children: Peter,[15] Margaret, Andrew, and Catherine.[16]
In 1997, he married Lorraine Smothers (née Martin) (b. 1959), the former wife of comedian Dick Smothers.[17] Lorraine has two children from her marriage to Smothers: Sarah Smothers and Remick Smothers.[18][19]
On October 11, 2006, The Washington Post revealed that Wallace had been a registered Democrat for more than two decades. Wallace explained his party affiliation in terms of pragmatism, insisting that being a Democrat is the only feasible means of participating in the political process in heavily Democratic Washington, D.C. He maintained he had voted for candidates from both major parties in the past.[21] This same explanation was used by the late conservative commentator Robert D. Novak in explaining his registration as a Democrat while residing in the District of Columbia.

=======================================================
This weekend will mark Chris Wallace‘s 10th anniversary as host of Fox News Sunday. In advance of such a milestone, Wallace spoke to Mediaite about his time at Fox, some of his best and worst interviews, and whether Presidents Bush or Obama were a better interview. Read below.
MEDIAITE: You’ve made a name for yourself as being willing to skewer both sides… How do you react when people assume you’re a partisan Republican because of generalizations people make about Fox?
WALLACE: Interestingly enough, even Bill Clinton made that generalization. When I asked him what I thought was a fair question, he said, “Yeah, it is, but have you ever asked it of Republicans?” It made me wonder if he’d ever watched Fox News Sunday. We really don’t play favorites, we don’t pull punches, and we’re as tough on interviews as the others.
But because it’s Fox, some outsiders see when I’m tough on republicans, and act surprised it makes news. Just in the last couple of months, I interviewed both [Obama officials] Denis McDonough and Jack Lew and I think you’d be hard-pressed to find the difference of approach between them and my interviews with Republicans.
And, quite frankly, people mix up the primetime opinion shows with our daytime news-gathering coverage. When you look at our election coverage, we always have our newspeople covering the desk — Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, etc. MSNBC, on the other hand, had all of its opinion people anchoring the desk.
The biggest moment, I’d say, was that Bill Clinton interview from 2006. The deal: We’d spend half time talking about his Clinton Global Initiative, and then half the time talking anything we wanted. There had been a docudrama about the path to 9/11 which criticized him for not doing more to take out [Osama] bin Laden, and when I mentioned it, he just went off. 
It was quite remarkable. I remember thinking that I was shocked he had lost his composure, and then thinking “How do I handle this? I don’t want to get into a fight. And this was really great television.”
I’ve also really enjoyed my trips to Madrid, interviewing the Spanish prime minister, or my trips to the major conventions, or my trip to Camp David when I interviewed President [George W.] Bush there.
And, of course, another huge moment was when Jon Stewart came on the program and called me insane. I wasn’t looking for a confrontation. I’ve gone on his show maybe 4-5 times, and he likes to tweak me as if i’m some right-wing advocate. And so, when he was on, I called him a liberal advocate. He acted as though I insulted him. 
We made up afterwards, though. He reached out and said there’s nothing personal. And, honestly, the only thing worse than being skewered by Stewart would be not being skewered by Stewart. To some degree, it’s a rite of passage.
Can you tell us some of your worst interviews? Ever encounter someone who just wouldn’t break from their talking points?
I can’t name anyone, obviously, but the worst interviews are those who just gives talking points. And no matter how hard you engage them, they never stray from rehearsed points. It’s also bad if they take a long time to get to the point. The best guests are always those who give straight answers. 
When I think of who is actually good at being interviewed, I’d say Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Dick Durbin (D-IL). 
I’m well-aware of the joke about McCain being overexposed on the Sunday shows, but there’s a reason he’s always booked. These are guys who you ask a question and they give it a straight answer. I’ve also always enjoyed interviewing [former Obama advisor] David Axelrod. Sure, he had spin, but he got past it really quickly. And when you give a tough question, he’s not afraid to get combative.
Of the two presidents you’ve interviewed in office, who was more difficult to pin down? Bush or Obama?
Bush was tough to pin down for an interview. I only got one sit-down in 2008. That White House was really quite reluctant to put him on. I’ve interviewed Obama twice as president (but not for FNS, and once as a candidate. I think I have a reputation as a tough interview and I believe both Republicans and Democrats feel that way. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) thinks I’m the toughest Sunday show interviewer, and he often warns Republican senators that they won’t get an easy interview from me.
As for who was a worse interview, I’d say presidents always have a similar toughness about them. By the time you get to be president, you have a network of aides and advisers, you get your talking points, and regardless of whether it’s a senate or presidential interview, or cabinet, I think it’s one of the challenges of doing a Sunday talk show is that these guys are scripted and all have talking points. The challenge is to break through and get them to react and think and talk.
One big advantage of Sunday is the luxury of time. We have a 12-14 minute interview. So you ask a question and then you ask the follow-up. By the second or third round you can finally get them to go off the talking point. 
So when you “grill” public figures, is your aim to draw out newsworthy thoughts they might not otherwise express — i.e., “good TV” — or is it simply to hold them accountable?
It’s a bit of both. Here’s the thing about Sunday morning talk shows: There are a lot of other things people could be doing, like reading a paper, sleeping, talking to their family. I really feel like you’ve got to add value for those who made the decision to watch you on a Sunday morning. There has to be a sense that it was an hour worth investing. So I hope our audience learns something and is entertained.
You want to get interesting guests on interesting subjects that affect lives. At the end of an interview, you want the audience to know more than they did going in. Part of that obviously is making news, but over the course of 10 years, my view has changed: At the beginning, I was single-minded about getting picked up by a major press outlet, being quoted in the Times or something. But now, in a more three-dimensional way, I think I just want people to learn something or have an interesting takeaway from the hour.
I’d love to interview Pope Francis. He’s the most interesting figure in the world right now. He’s essentially remaking a 2,000-year-old institution and I am really fascinated with what he’s trying to do and how he’s opening the doors and letting the air and sunlight shine in on the institution that has previously been closed-off. If I had a single interview, I’d pick him. 
Some have noted that you’re not on Twitter, while most of your competition is. Why haven’t you gotten on-board?
Well our show is involved on Twitter, because it’s just another platform to reach out to audience. But personally, I don’t see myself doing it. I simply don’t have the time. I also think I owe the audience a good show, but I don’t owe them what I had for breakfast.
Also, when I follow my colleagues on Twitter, I almost never see anything worthwhile. Honestly, it’s just another opportunity to blow up your career. 
It had a huge impact on me, overwhelmingly in a positive way. On the negative end: I wouldn’t say it now, but starting out, there was the cloud hanging over me. I had to deal with the suspicion of nepotism. 
But on the positive end, I’ve had an enormous opportunity from a very young age to meet people and be exposed to journalism. Through both my father and my stepfather Bill Leonard. My first job was at age 16 going to the 1964 Republican National Convention. Another time, through my father, I was invited to meet Malcolm X. And through my stepfather, I met Eleanor Roosevelt when I was 10 or 12 years old. The exposure was quite extraordinary.
In the professional sense, I learned a lot from my father. Watching by example, I learned there’s an art of the interview; and it’s something I enjoy doing. He also taught me the value of research and preparation. You always go into an interview knowing less about a subject than your interviewee — for instance, a Treasury Secretary will know more about the budget — but you can research and prepare in a way that makes it clear that they can’t just come in and spin you. 
He was a famously competitive person, and as I’ve said in the past: At some time, someone who dealt with my father hadn’t spoken with him for a while. Having said that, in the last quarter century we had become very good friends. He’d call me and critique me and I’d do the same with him.
In an industry where there’s a lot of sharp elbows, all he ever wanted was for me to be the best journalist and most successful I could be. And I felt the same about him.
