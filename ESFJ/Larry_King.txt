King attending a ceremony for Bill Maher to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on September 14, 2010
Larry King (born November 19, 1933 as Lawrence Leibel Harvey Zeiger) is an American television and radio host, actor, voice artist, and comedian whose work has been recognized with awards including two Peabodys and 10 Cable ACE Awards.
He began as a local Florida journalist and radio interviewer in the 1950s and 1960s and became prominent as an all-night national radio broadcaster starting in 1978. From 1985 to 2010, he hosted the nightly interview television program Larry King Live on CNN. He currently hosts Larry King Now on Hulu and RT America Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. He also hosts "Politicking with Larry King," a weekly political talk show Thursday evenings on RT America.[1]
King was born Lawrence Leibel Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn, New York City, New York on November 19, 1933 to an Austrian immigrant Edward Jonaton Zeiger, a restaurant owner and defense-plant worker, and his wife Jennie (Gitlitz), a garment worker, who emigrated from Belarus.[2][3][4] Both parents were Orthodox Jews.[5]
King's father died at 46 of a heart attack[6] and his mother had to go on welfare to support her two sons. His father's death greatly affected King, and he lost interest in school. After graduating from high school, he worked to help support his mother. He did not go to college. From an early age, however, he had wanted to go into radio.[7]
A CBS staff announcer, whom King met by chance, told him to go to Florida, a growing media market where openings still existed for inexperienced broadcasters. King rode a train to Miami.
After initial setbacks, King persisted and got his first job in radio. The manager of a small station, WAHR (now WMBM) in Miami Beach, hired him to clean up and perform miscellaneous tasks.[8] When one of their announcers quit, they put King on the air. His first broadcast was on May 1, 1957, when he worked as the disc jockey from 9 a.m. to noon.[9] He also did two afternoon newscasts and a sportscast. He was paid $55 a week.
He acquired the name Larry King when the general manager Marshall Simmonds said that Zeiger was too ethnic and difficult to remember, so Larry chose the surname King, which he got from an ad in The Miami Herald for King's Wholesale Liquor, minutes before air.[10]
He started doing interviews on a mid-morning show for WIOD, at Pumpernik's Restaurant in Miami Beach.[11] He would interview anyone who walked in. His first interview was with a waiter at the restaurant.[12] Two days later, singer Bobby Darin, in Miami for a concert later that day, walked into Pumpernik's as a result of coming across King's show on his radio; Darin became King's first celebrity interview guest.[13]
His Miami radio show launched him to local stardom. A few years later, in May 1960, he hosted Miami Undercover, airing Sunday nights at 11:30 p.m. on WPST-TV Channel 10 (now WPLG).[14] On the show, he moderated debates on important issues of the time.
King credits his success on local television to the assistance of comedian Jackie Gleason, whose national television variety show was being filmed in Miami Beach during this period. "That show really took off because Gleason came to Miami," King said in a 1996 interview he gave when inducted into the Broadcasters' Hall of Fame. "He did that show and stayed all night with me. We stayed till five in the morning. He didn't like the set, so we broke into the general manager's office and changed the set. Gleason changed the set, he changed the lighting, and he became like a mentor of mine."[15]
During this period, WIOD gave King further exposure as a color commentator for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League, during their 1970 season and most of their 1971 season.[16] However, he was dismissed by both WIOD and television station WTVJ as a late-night radio host and sports commentator as of December 20, 1971, when he was arrested after being accused of grand larceny by a former business partner.[17] Other staffers covered the Dolphins' games into their 24–3 loss to Dallas in Super Bowl VI. King also lost his weekly column at the Miami Beach Sun newspaper. The charges were dropped on March 10, 1972, and King spent the next several years in reviving his career, including a stint as the color announcer in Louisiana for the Shreveport Steamer of the World Football League in 1974–75 on KWKH. Eventually, King was rehired by WIOD in Miami. For several years during the 1970s in South Florida, he hosted a sports talk-show called "Sports-a-la-King" that featured guests and callers.
In 1978, King went national, inheriting the nightly talk show slot on the Mutual Broadcasting System, broadcast coast-to-coast, that had been "Long John" Nebel's until his death, and had been pioneered by Herb Jepko.[18] One reason King got the Mutual job is that he had once been an announcer at WGMA-AM in Hollywood, Florida, which was then owned by C. Edward Little. Little went on to become president of Mutual and was the one who hired King when Nebel died. King's Mutual show developed a devoted audience.[citation needed]
It was broadcast live Monday through Friday from midnight to 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time. King would interview a guest for the first 90 minutes, with callers asking questions that continued the interview for another 90 minutes. At 3 a.m., he would allow callers to discuss any topic they pleased with him, until the end of the program, when he expressed his own political opinions. That segment was called "Open Phone America." Some of the regular callers used the pseudonyms "The Portland Laugher," "The Miami Derelict," "The Todd Cruz Caller," "The Scandal Scooper," "Mr. Radio" and "The Water Is Warm Caller." "Mr. Radio" made over 200 calls to King during Open Phone America. The show was successful, starting with relatively few affiliates and eventually growing to more than 500. It ran until 1994.[citation needed]
For its final year, the show was moved to afternoons, but, because most talk radio stations at the time had an established policy of local origination in the time-slot (3 to 6 p.m. Eastern Time) that Mutual offered the show, a very low percentage of King's overnight affiliates agreed to carry his daytime show and it was unable to generate the same audience size.[citation needed] The afternoon show was eventually given to David Brenner and radio affiliates were given the option of carrying the audio of King's new CNN evening television program. The Westwood One radio simulcast of the CNN show continued until December 31, 2009.
King during a recording of his Larry King Live program at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, in 2006
He started his Larry King Live CNN show in June 1985, hosting a broad range of guests from controversial figures of UFO conspiracy theories and alleged psychics,[19] to prominent politicians and leading figures in the entertainment industry, often doing their first or only interview on breaking news stories on his show.
Unlike many interviewers, King has a direct, non-confrontational approach. His reputation for asking easy, open-ended questions has made him attractive to important figures who want to state their position while avoiding being challenged on contentious topics.[20] His interview style is characteristically frank, but with occasional bursts of irreverence and humor. His approach attracts some guests who would not otherwise appear. King, who is known for his general lack of pre-interview preparation, once bragged that he never read the books of authors before they made their appearances on his program.[citation needed]
In a show dedicated to the surviving Beatles, King asked George Harrison's widow about the song "Something," which was written about Harrison's first wife. He seemed surprised when she did not know very much about the song.
Throughout his career King has interviewed many of the leading figures of his time. CNN claimed during his final episode that he had performed 60,000 interviews in his career.[citation needed]
King also wrote a regular newspaper column in USA Today for almost 20 years, from shortly after that newspaper's origin in 1982 until September 2001.[21] The column consisted of short "plugs, superlatives and dropped names" but was dropped when the newspaper redesigned its "Life" section.[22] The column was resurrected in blog form in November 2008[23] and on Twitter in April 2009.[24]
On June 29, 2010, King announced that after 25 years, he would be stepping down from his nightly job hosting Larry King Live. However, he stated that he would remain with CNN to host occasional specials.[25] The announcement came in the wake of speculation that CNN had approached Piers Morgan, the British television personality and journalist, as King's primetime replacement,[26] which was confirmed that September.[27][28]
The final edition of Larry King Live aired on December 16, 2010.[29] The show concluded with his last thoughts and a thank you to his audience for watching and supporting him over the years. The final words of Larry King on the show was, "I... I, I don't know what to say except to you, my audience, thank you. And instead of goodbye, how about so long."[30]
In March 2012, King co-founded Ora TV, a production company, with Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim; the company signed a multi-year exclusive deal with Hulu to exclusively carry King's new talk-oriented web series, Larry King Now, beginning July 17.[32]
On October 23, 2012, King hosted the third-party presidential debate on Ora TV, featuring Jill Stein, Rocky Anderson, Virgil Goode and Gary Johnson.[33]
In May 2013 RT America announced that King would be anchoring a new talk show on its network. King said in an advertisement on RT: "I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power, instead of speaking on their behalf."[34][35] He also is bringing his Hulu show Larry King Now to RT.[36] On June 13, 2013 RT previewed Larry King's new Thursday evening political talk show Politicking with Larry King with a discussion of Edward Snowden's leaking of the PRISM surveillance program.[37] King stated in early March 2014, during the 2014 Crimean crisis, “I don’t work for RT. My podcasts, Larry King Now and Politicking, are licensed for a fee to RT America by New York-based Ora TV.[38]
Larry King remains active as a writer and television journalist. King was the moderator of the sixth Kazenergy Eurasian Forum in Astana, Kazakhstan, an annual forum for Kazakhstan's energy sector occurring in October 2011.[39][40][41]
King also guest starred in episodes of 30 Rock and Gravity Falls. He also had cameos in Ghostbusters[42] and Bee Movie. King also voiced Doris the Ugly Stepsister in Shrek 2 and its sequels.
King made an appearance alongside his wife, Shawn King, on October 8 edition of WWE Monday Night Raw and participated in a segment with The Miz and Kofi Kingston. He had served as Raw's Social Media Ambassador the previous week.
King has become a very active user on the social-networking site Twitter, where he posts thoughts and comments on a wide variety of subjects. King states, “I love tweeting, I think it’s a different world we’ve entered. When people were calling in, they were calling in to the show and now on Twitter I’m giving out thoughts, opinions. The whole concept has changed.”[43]
As a result of heart attacks, he established the Larry King Cardiac Foundation, an organization to which David Letterman, through The Letterman Foundation for Courtesy and Grooming, has also contributed. King gave $1 million to George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs for scholarships to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.[citation needed] King serves as a member of the Board of Directors on the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers.[citation needed]
On September 3, 2005, following Hurricane Katrina, King aired "How You Can Help", a three-hour special designed to provide a forum and information clearinghouse for viewers to understand and join nationwide and global relief efforts. On January 18, 2010, in the wake the 2010 Haiti earthquake, King aired "Haiti: How You Can Help", a special two-hour edition designed to show viewers how to take action and be a part of the global outreach. Following the Deepwater Horizon explosion, King aired "Disaster in the Gulf: How You Can Help", a special two-hour edition designed to show viewers how to take action in the clean-up efforts on the Gulf Coast.[citation needed]
On August 30, 2010, King served as the host of Chabad's 30th annual "To Life" telethon, in Los Angeles.[citation needed]
On October 24, 2012, King was a guest speaker at Alberta's first We Day event, a youth empowerment conference, held for young adults as part of the Free the Children movement.[citation needed]
On September 10, 1990, while on The Joan Rivers Show, Rivers asked King which contestant in the Miss America pageant was "the ugliest." King responded, "Miss Pennsylvania. She was one of the 10 finalists and she did a great ventriloquist bit [...] The dummy was prettier."[45] King was a judge for the September 8, 1990, pageant. King later sent Miss Pennsylvania, Marla Wynne, a dozen long-stemmed roses and a telegram apologizing for saying she was the ugliest contestant in the pageant that year.[46]
In 1997, King was one of 34 celebrities to sign an open letter to then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune, which protested the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, comparing it to the Nazis' oppression of Jews in the 1930s.[47] Other signatories included Dustin Hoffman and Goldie Hawn.[47]
King has been married eight times, to seven women.[48] He married high-school sweetheart Freda Miller in 1951 at age 18.[49] That union ended the following year at the behest of their parents, who reportedly had the youngsters' marriage annulled.[49] King was later briefly married to Annette Kaye[49] who gave birth to his son, Larry Jr., in November 1961. King did not meet Larry Jr. until the son was in his thirties.[50] Larry Jr. and his wife, Shannon, have three children.[48]
In 1961, King married his third wife, Alene Akins, a Playboy Bunny at one of the magazine's eponymous nightclubs. Larry adopted Alene's son Andy in 1962, and divorced the following year.[49] In 1963, King married his fourth wife, Mary Francis "Mickey" Stuphin, who divorced King.[49] He remarried Akins, with whom he had a second child, Chaia, in 1969.[49] The couple divorced a second time in 1972.[49] In 1997, Dove Books published a book written by King and Chaia, Daddy Day, Daughter Day. Aimed at young children, it tells each of their accounts of his divorce from Akins.
On September 25, 1976, King married his fifth wife, math teacher and production assistant Sharon Lepore. The couple divorced in 1983.[51]
King met businesswoman Julie Alexander in summer 1989, and proposed to her on the couple's first date, on August 1, 1989.[52] Alexander became King's sixth wife on October 7, 1989, when the two were married in Washington, D.C.[53] The couple lived in different cities, however, with Alexander in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and King in Washington, D.C., where he worked. They separated in 1990 and divorced in 1992.[53] He became engaged to actress Deanna Lund in 1995, after five weeks of dating, but they remained unmarried.[54]
In 1997, he married his seventh wife, Shawn Southwick, born in 1959[55][56] as Shawn Ora Engemann,[55] a singer, actress, and TV host,[57] in King's Los Angeles, California, hospital room three days before King underwent heart surgery to clear a clogged blood vessel.[56] The couple has two children: Chance, born March 1999, and Cannon, born May 2000.[58] He is stepfather to Danny Southwick.[59] On King and Southwick's 10th anniversary in September 2007, Southwick joked she was "the only [wife] to have lasted into the two digits".[57] On April 14, 2010, both Larry and Shawn King filed for divorce,[56][60] but have since stopped the proceedings.
In July 2009, King appeared on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, where he told host O'Brien about his wishes to be cryonically preserved upon death,[61] as he had revealed in his book My Remarkable Journey.[62] In December 2011, preceding a CNN Special on the topic, the Kings had a special dinner with friends Conan O'Brien, Tyra Banks, Shaquille O'Neal, Seth MacFarlane, Jack Dorsey, Quincy Jones, and Russell Brand where his intent to do so was reiterated, among other topics that were discussed.[63]
On February 24, 1987, King suffered a major heart attack and then had quintuple-bypass surgery.[64] Since then, King has written two books about living with heart disease. Mr. King, You're Having a Heart Attack: How a Heart Attack and Bypass Surgery Changed My Life (1989, ISBN 0-440-50039-7) was written with New York's Newsday science editor B. D. Colen. Taking On Heart Disease: Famous Personalities Recall How They Triumphed over the Nation's #1 Killer and How You Can, Too (2004, ISBN 1-57954-820-2) features the experience of various celebrities with cardiovascular disease including Peggy Fleming and Regis Philbin.
On February 12, 2010, King revealed that he had undergone surgery five weeks earlier to place stents in his coronary artery to remove plaque from his heart. During the segment on Larry King Live which discussed Bill Clinton's similar procedure, King said he was "feeling great" and had been in the hospital for just one day.[citation needed]
On Norm Macdonald's video podcast Norm Macdonald Live in April 2013, King stated that he did not believe in a higher power nor did he believe he would be going anywhere after he died.[65]
King has received many broadcasting awards. He won the Peabody Award for Excellence in broadcasting for both his radio (1982) and television (1992) shows. He has also won 10 CableACE awards for Best Interviewer and for Best Talk Show Series.
In 1989, King was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame,[citation needed] and in 1996 to the Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.[7] In 2002, the industry publication Talkers Magazine named King both the fourth-greatest radio talk show host of all time and the top television talk show host of all time.[66]
In 1994, King received the Scopus Award from the American Friends of Hebrew University.[5] In June 1998, he received an Honorary Degree from Brooklyn College, City University of New York, for his life achievements.
He was given the Golden Mike Award for Lifetime Achievement in January 2009, by the Radio & Television News Association of Southern California.
King is an honorary member of the Rotary Club of Beverly Hills. He is also a recipient of the President's Award honoring his impact on media from the Los Angeles Press Club in 2006.
King is the first recipient of the Arizona State University Hugh Downs Award for Communication Excellence,[67] presented April 11, 2007, via satellite by Downs himself.[68] Downs sported red suspenders for the event and turned the tables on King by asking "very tough questions" about King's best, worst and most influential interviews during King's 50 years in broadcasting.[citation needed]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Larry King was born on November 19, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, USA as Lawrence Harvey Zeiger. He is an actor, known for Larry King Live (1985), Larry King Now (2012) and We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993). He has been married to Shawn Southwick since September 5, 1997. They have two children. He was previously married to Julie Alexander, Sharon Lepore, Mickey Sutphin, Annette Kaye, Freda Miller and Alene Akins.
      Features in the 1996 paperback "Mug Shots" that includes many other celebrities who've been arrested for one reason or another.
      The King-Southwick Mormon-Jewish wedding ceremony was celebrated in the Beverly Hills garden of actress Deborah Raffin. Stellar wedding guests included Ted Turner (Best Man), Jane Fonda, Al Pacino, Beverly D'Angelo, Don Rickles, etc.
      Underwent surgery on March 16, 2007 to unblock a carotid artery at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.
      He used Larry King as a stage name on the advice that his original surname, Zeiger, sounded "too Jewish".
      Never prepares for interviews. His reasoning is that the average audience member knows little or nothing about a given show guest, so he prefers to begin as they would begin, and learn about the guest during the course of the show.
      He and Shawn Southwick filed for divorce on April 14, 2010. They reconciled in July the same year and both filed petitions to dismiss their divorce.
      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6616 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.
      Release of his book, "The People's Princess: Cherished Memories of Diana, Princess of Wales, From Those Who Knew Her Best".
      Release of his book, "Anything Goes!: What I've Learned From Pundits, Politicians and Presidents" by Larry with Pat Piper.
      I never think of access or good will. I just want a good interview. I want guests to be informative and entertaining. I've never been concerned about someone's liking me tomorrow.
=======================================================
There has been a lot of hub-bub surrounding Larry King’s recent separation from Shawn Southwick, putting the talk show host in line for his 8th divorce. (CLICK HERE to read all about how Larry allegedly cheated on his sexy blond wife with his sexy blond wife’s sexy blond younger sister Shannon Engemann!)
That’s means Larry has as many divorces as Jon and Kate have children! I did the math, and figuring in Larry’s age, that averages out to a marriage every 37 years! (Heh heh! That was for you Conan!)
If you’re like me and have more than a second-grade education, you’ve probably figured out that the number from the title of this post (7) doesn’t add up to 8. That’s because Larry married one of his wives twice, that being Playboy model Alene Akins who is pictured with Larry here in 1972:
Here’s the Larry King ex-wives time line with children and a few other pertinent tidbits of information thrown in:
Very short marriage that lasted less than a year. Larry divorced Annette while she was pregnant with Larry King, Jr. who was born in 1961. Annette didn’t tell Larry he had a son until she was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer over 30 years later. Larry King, Jr. was eventually put in charge of Larry Sr.’s heart disease foundation.
(Non-marriage-related) 1971: Larry King arrested! (From NNDB.com) “In 1971, he was arrested for grand larceny, and pleaded no contest to passing a bad check. The particulars remain muddled and unproven, but it’s alleged that King tried to sell his influence with Richard M. Nixon’s attorney general John Mitchell to a convicted stock swindler named Louis Wolfson. After these odd events he was off the air for a few years, and worked as an announcer at a race track.”
Larry King sued Julia for slander after their break alleging Julia had broken a legal agreement prohibiting her from talking about their marriage publicly. The case was settled in 1994 but the court documents were sealed.
Minister in the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, made famous by Arianna Huffington. Rama met Larry when he was judging a Florida beauty contest she was participating in back in 1968. The couple broke up after Rama agreed to testify on ex-wife Julia Alexander’s behalf. Larry King later sued Rama for slander after she claimed in Washingtonian magazine that she broke up with Larry, not the other way around. (Read all about that HERE) In the book Reputation: Portraits in Power Rama is quoted as saying, “Larry has to have relationships upon relationships, so he always has a place where that stimulation is going on.” … “Larry is astonishing in the things he finds to lie about and deny. To me, he’s a sports liar.”
Mother of sons Chance of Cannon. Mormon. Married twice previously, including public relations executive Michael Levine. Larry adopted her son Danny Southwick.
There you go! Did you notice that every woman Larry King has been married to that I was able to find a picture of is/was a smoking hot slender blond? Does anyone out there know if any of the women not pictured here were brunettes?
“I don’t think he feels guilty about anything,” says someone who knows King very, very well. “That would imply he was capable of understanding what he’d done. . . . If he were capable of knowing what he’d done, people would hate him a lot more.” Instead, King has a way of making all his transgressions seem as harmless as his blue suede shoes. And perhaps you have to have a special vulnerability to be taken in by Larry King, whether in business or in love. But it’s interesting to note how neatly the common picture of King – as an easygoing, somewhat hapless man who poses no threat except the professional one of running a toothless interview show for newsmakers – inverts reality.
Any woman that marries a man with 6 wifes as a past history, will get what she deserves. How can any woman think that man will stay and be faithful forever. Plus, money, fame, come on what does Larry King have other then that?
as ugly as Mr King is now…he is much better looking than he was in his earlier years…were all those women blind or just loved money?
I went to school with Shawn in Jr High and High School and let me tell you she had very DARK hair. It was NOT blond…..I feel sorry for her. She married for money and not for love. Sad. What did she think she was getting with this old man who had been married so many times? I really feel for you Shawn….next time marry for love….
I think King looks natural in his booking photo a mug shot fits a scum like King. These women must be simple minded to think King is a real catch.
I have always liked Larry.  The best interviewer. Asked just a few questions and let the other person talk. Nobody could really replace him, least of all Piers Morgan who babbles non-stop and interrupts his guest.(s)
His present wife did not marry him for the money, I think she likes to be entertained and spoiled by him.
It is not uncommon for wealthy Jews to hook up with beautiful blonds   Just look at the wives of all powerful Jews, Spielberg,etc.  Notice how leading men in the movies have gone from Gable and Grant to Sandler and Meyers, etc., yet the women remain hot white blondes.
LOL That’s just hilarious! I didn’t know he had that many KIDS and wives…he’s such an freakin idiot, and he needs to get a hobby other than marrying blond idiots! It’s people like him who I want to just slap right across the face. Wish he could read this.

=======================================================
Larry King was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.  His father, a bar owner, died when he was only nine, and his mother had to go on welfare to support Larry and his younger brother.   Discouraged by his father's death, Larry stopped paying attention in school, dooming his chances for higher education.    After graduating from high school, he went to work to help support his mother.   From an early age, he had dreamed of a career in radio, and haunted the radio studios of New York.  In his 20s, working as a UPS delivery man, it seemed he would never get any closer to achieving his dream.
After a chance meeting with a CBS staff announcer, King took the older man's advice and caught a bus for Florida, where a rapidly growing media market was creating an opening for less experienced radio personalities.  After initial setbacks, King got his first break as a disc jockey on a Miami station and soon became a popular fixture of the South Florida radio scene.  In 1960, he debuted with his first program on Miami television.  Throughout the '60s and early '70s he built up his local following, adding a newspaper column to his radio and television chores.
Disaster struck in the '70s.  King's involvement with a disgraced financier cost him his radio, television and newspaper jobs.  He was deeply in debt and unable to find work in the Miami area, where he was best known.   He slowly rebuilt  his career, writing magazine articles and working in radio on the West Coast.  By the late 1970s, the scandal had blown over and Larry King was ready to return to the airwaves of South Florida. This time, sadder but wiser, he determined to live within his means and to protect his reputation.
In 1978, The Larry King Show went national, the first nationwide call-in show.  In 1985, the fledgling Cable News Network put Larry King Live on television, the first international live phone-in television program.  King interviewed athletes, actors, writers, politicians and foreign dignitaries.  The breadth of his influence was demonstrated conclusively when billionaire Ross Perot chose to announce his presidential candidacy live on the air on King's show.
In the 1992 election, the King show became a favorite forum for candidates.  In 1993, the program made history again when Vice President Al Gore agreed to appear on the program, with Ross Perot, to debate the controversial North American Free Trade Agreement, then being considered by Congress.  In national elections ever since, leading candidates chosen King's program to air their ideas before the public.  
Larry King lives in Beverly Hills, California, with his wife, Shawn Southwick King. It is his seventh marriage. Living in Southern California, he has enjoyed almost instantaneous access to the leading figures in mass media and the entertainment industry who have appeared on his program.   In 2007, he celebrated his 50th year in broadcasting.  He has conducted more than 30,000 interviews, his weekly column in USA Today is read all over the United States, and his daily radio and television shows have been seen and heard by millions around the world. His 25-year run as host of Larry King Live has been the longest tenure of any broadcaster as host of the same program in the same time slot. In 2010 Larry King announced that he would retire from the program shortly after his 25th anniversary broadcast.

                                  ominous directive both to the veteran reporters who wanted to maintain 
                                  their careers and to the young wannabes eager to make it. The bespectacled 
                                  Larry King was just starting out himself when he read those guiding 
                                  But an insatiably curious and courageous King ignored the writing 
                                  on the wall, and proudly tells how throughout his career he always 
                                  King tells. If I was curious about something, I asked the question. 
                                  never forget. While interviewing a Catholic priest, King, the innocent 
                                  Jewish boychik from Brooklyn, asked the celibate priest how many children 
                                  he had. The look on his face is something I still see in my nightmares, 
                                  almost childlike, inquisitiveness and King continued to greet his guests 
                                  with an indefatigable salvo of questions. He had a soothing way about 
                                  him that put his guests at ease and got them to open up. It was with 
                                  his matter-of-fact style that in 1992 he got Ross Perot to make the 
                                  unprecedented announcement on CNN that he would run for president. 
                                  over 40,000 people, King has honed his gift of listening which he feels 
                                  is the only way to learn. I always knew that I never learned anything 
                                  that King learned the greatest lesson of his journalistic journey. It 
                                  a day he had dreamed about since he was a little boy. In his dreams, 
                                  was finally before him, King froze and was simply not able to speak. 
                                  stormed into his booth and said, This is the communications business, 
                                  so communicate! So on May 1, 1957, at WAHR in Miami Beach, Florida, 
                                  Larry King found his voice and has not stopped talking ever since. He 
                                  told his listeners that it was his first time ever on the radio, that 
                                  he was scared and that his boss had just screamed at him. Since that 
                                  day King was never afraid again because he had learned to simply just 
                                  Larry King nurtured his broadcasting dreams. As a child he would pretend 
                                  that at ball games, when Larry was only 10 years old, he would go to 
                                  the back of the stands, roll up his score card and pretend it was a 
                                  mike and that he was a sportscaster. While most of the young boys fantasized 
                                  about being ball players, King aspired to be the announcer. When 
                                  I was 5 years old, I would lie in bed, look at the radio, and want to 
                                  born Larry H. Zeiger on November 19, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, was 
                                  He recalls how his father had prayed for a boy and blessedly Larry was 
                                  born. He was a gift from God to parents who just a year earlier had 
                                  buried their first-born son, Irwin, when he died of appendicitis. Larry, 
                                  would go everywhere with his father. They were extremely close, and 
                                  when little Larry, aged 9 1/2, was coming home from the library lugging 
                                  a pile of books, he saw a policeman coming down the stairs of his house. 
                                  The police officer approached Larry, swept him up in his arms and broke 
                                  the crushing news to himhis beloved father, who was only 43 years 
                                  old, had suffered a fatal heart attack. Larrys hero was gone forever. 
                                  took his death very badly because I took it as him leaving me. My father 
                                  walk, his smell, and the sound of his voice. He says that although his 
                                  father was usually very funny and fun to be around, there are two strict 
                                  lessons he learned from him that he will never forget. One day while 
                                  the family was sitting around the dining room table as they did every 
                                  evening, his father asked, Leibel, how was Hebrew school today? 
                                  says he flew across the room. His father had met someone who informed 
                                  just sat there, picked up his spoon and continued to eat his soup, 
                                  painful for King. His father had always cautioned him to never talk 
                                  to strangers. So once, while sitting on the steps outside of his house 
                                  when he was 7 years old, Larry made every effort to ignore the mafia-type 
                                  he beckoned again. King got up and walked toward the car. The sinister 
                                  character popped open his trunk and started scooping out bunches of 
                                  next time he disobeys me, Im gonna give away all his comic books 
                                  walked into his room and asked him where he got his new collection. 
                                  King told his father some guy gave them to him. But because he had disobeyed 
                                  his father, the ill-fated comic books were once again plucked from loving 
                                  vivid, the absence of his father was extremely painful for him and his 
                                  family. They also suffered economic hardship. King, his mother, and 
                                  younger brother, Martin, were forced to relocate to Bensonhurst and 
                                  soon found themselves on government relief, the welfare of days gone 
                                  by. But with that government assistance came regular visits by agency 
                                  employees who came to inspect whether the family was living within its 
                                  slipped drastically. He also let slip away many of the Orthodox Jewish 
                                  practices with which he had been raised. Furious that his father was 
                                  taken from him, King also buried his belief in God. He has been an agnostic 
                                  become a broadcaster. After he graduated from high school, he did all 
                                  kinds of odd jobs to help out his family, but his ambitions were brewing 
                                  inside of him. Everyone told him he was crazy and that he should pursue 
                                  a job with a future. So while his friends went off to college, the obstinate 
                                  dreamer was selling milk, delivering parcels and working in a mail room. 
                                  But it just so happened that the mail room he was working at was in 
                                  the same building as radio station WOR. King has told reporters how 
                                  everyday he would ride up the elevator six or seven times to WOR and 
                                  pretend that he was an announcer. One day he bumped into a CBS announcer 
                                  and told him that he always wanted to be on radio and asked if he had 
                                  any advice. The man advised him to go to Miami Beach where he was sure 
                                  age 22 Larry packed his bags, left all that was familiar to him, and 
                                  headed south. He knocked on door after door until finally opportunity 
                                  knocked back. After passing a voice test at WAHR, he was hiredto 
                                  sweep floors. He accepted the job with the proviso that when an on-air 
                                  position opened up, hed be the first to get the job. It did, and 
                                  he got it. But five minutes before airtime his boss asked him what stage 
                                  too ethnic. Suddenly, an advertisement in the newspaper for Kings 
                                  be Zeiger. He tells how thrilled he was when he saw the name Zeiger 
                                  listed at Ellis Island and says that when his day comes, Zeiger 
                                  the name his boss gave him and in turn made a name for himself. His 
                                  show was a great hit. People loved his affable, funny, and non-threatening 
                                  style. A consummate multi-tasker, the young radio personality was soon 
                                  hired by WKAT and then WIOD to host a talk show from a houseboat used 
                                  by ABC for their TV series, Surfside 6. He interviewed everyone from 
                                  famous personalities to regular Joes and was equally captivated by whoever 
                                  was sitting in front of him at the time. In addition, he began writing 
                                  from Brooklyn to Miami Beach. It was not long before King was given 
                                  his own TV show at WLBW-TV called Miami Undercover. In 1964 he left 
                                  time he was ever nervous again throughout his career. In an interview 
                                  with Sun Valley, he recounts the comedic events of his first night on 
                                  TV: Two lawyers were debating. They were on the left and the right, 
                                  and I was in the middle. But the producers had made a major mistake. 
                                  They gave me a swivel chair with no back. This was supposed to look 
                                  hip. What happens, I turned to my left and I just kept swiveling. I 
                                  could not stop the swivel; I would go to one and have to grab myself 
                                  to stop. So I swiveled the entire show. I was also smoking at the same 
                                  time. You smoked on television then all the time. So my reviews said, 
                                  of control. He was living beyond his means and borrowing money from 
                                  for King to repay the $5,000 he owed and had him arrested. King was 
                                  charged with grand larceny. Although the charges were dropped, the story 
                                  hit all the newspapers and consequently he was dismissed from all of 
                                  back on his success during the 60s and says that from a broadcast 
                                  standpoint those were the most incredible years of his life. Anybody 
                                  who was anyone passed through Miami in those days and King got to interview 
                                  them all. He feels there have never been election like the Nixon-Humphrey 
                                  King, who went from being directly involved in the unfolding of history 
                                  to being history. But true to the blessing of his Jewish name, Leibel, 
                                  after four years of lamenting the error of his ways and promising to 
                                  never reverse course, WIOD rehired him. In 1976, he endured another 
                                  painful setback when his mother passed away. Although she had seen some 
                                  measure of her sons fame, she never lived to see how far he would 
                                  ultimately go. King says that he is also truly sorry that his father 
                                  himself back on TV and publishing articles again. On January 30, 1978, 
                                  he debuted the Larry King Show where he introduced the concept of live 
                                  phone-in guests on radio. It rendered its host into a national name. 
                                  In 1983, King hosted a national TV show that was syndicated to 118 Stations. 
                                  by the father of 24-hour cable news, Ted Turner. He brought King over 
                                  to CNN in 1985, and Larry King Live was brought to life. With this first-of-a-kind 
                                  call-in television show, which airs at 9 p.m. (ET), Kings became 
                                  In 1992, The National Association of Radio Talk Show Hosts named him, 
                                  and record breakers. He maintains to this day that Frank Sinatra was 
                                  still his best guest ever and Robert Mitchum, who spent the whole interview 
                                  giving one-word answers, was his worst. King was so desperate that he 
                                  His most recent is Moon Over Manhattan, his first fiction novel, which 
                                  he co-authored with his friend, Thomas H. Cook. Post 9/11 they were 
                                  inspired to write a lighthearted, comical, pro-New York book after witnessing 
                                  numerous awards. But probably the ones most precious to him are his 
                                  two Peabody awards and his Emmy, seeing that he says those would be 
                                  the only materialistic things hed save if his house was on fire. 
                                  King has been inducted into five of the nations leading broadcasting 
                                  halls of fame and is the recipient of the prestigious Allen H. Neuharth 
                                  Award for Excellence in Journalism. King also won a News and Documentary 
                                  Emmy Award for Outstanding Interview/Interviewer and 10 Cable ACE awards 
                                  for Best Interviewer and for best Talk Show Series. Others awards which 
                                  he also truly values include the Gracie Allen Award; the Unity Award 
                                  by Lincoln University of Missouri; the Public Service Award by the American 
                                  Award for increasing public awareness about neuroscience, and the March 
                                  of Dimes Franklin Delano Roosevelt Award for his efforts on behalf 
                                  of community volunteerism. He was also honored by the American Academy 
                                  there are still some interviews that King would really like to get, 
                                  such as Prince Charles, Chelsea Clinton, Osama bin Laden, and the Pope, 
                                  who has declined to be interviewed. He says that some questions he might 
                                  have asked the Pope are what it was like to have lived under both Hitler 
                                  and Stalin, or what influence Judaism had on the Popes life seeing 
                                  that most of his childhood friends were Jews. But King says that if 
                                  he could land an interview with God himself, hed ask him one simple 
                                  twice with the same woman. He has five children. He met his current 
                                  wife, Shawn Southwick, in 1996 while shopping at Tiffanys in Los 
                                  Angeles. King was immediately struck by the blonde beauty. Their relationship 
                                  solidified and endured, but when it came time for the lavish wedding 
                                  heart surgery immediately, so the couple got married in UCLA Hospital 
                                  in September of 1997. The couple lives together with their two children 
                                  in their 18 room mansion in Beverly Hills. When asked if this is going 
                                  gonna be 70 years old, we have two kids together, where am I gonna go? 
                                  whom he often attends services, he has also remained close to his Jewish 
                                    Hashanah and Yom Kippur out of respect to his parents. He says that culturally he really enjoys 
                                  being Jewish and loves Jewish food and Jewish humor. Oddly enough, the 
                                  one thing that he still maintains is not mixing milk and meat together. 
 Even though King goes to synagogue he is not sure that God is hearing him. King, in a book he co-authored 
                                  with Rabbi Irwin Katsof entitled, Powerful Prayers, says the only thing 
                                  What King especially likes about Judaism, which he does not find in 
                                  other faiths, is that it forces people to continually question thingsa 
 King says that Jerusalem is his favorite city in the world. He loves seeing street signs in Hebrew. 
                                  about peace in the region. King believes that although 90% of the people 
                                    Meirs famed words that there would be peace if the Palestinians 
                                  never met any mother who wanted to lose her son, King says. No 
                                  won the World Series, or who would be the next president, he says. 
                                  first heart attack in 1987. Because of his heart problems, King started 
                                  the Larry King Cardiac Foundation to help people who couldnt afford 
                                  costly cardiac procedures. In that, and in many other ways, King continues 
                                  him. King himself admits that he rarely ever holds a grudge, that he 
                                  is loyal to a fault, even to the point of not being able to fire people. 
                                  But one thing is certain, nobody walks all over King, unless of course 
                                  industry. King has also recently established a $1 million journalism 
                                  scholarship at George Washington Universitys School of Media and 
                                  stand up in front of a crowd and make people laugh, he says. Its 
                                  like having a massive group of people saying I love you. He also

Larry King has not had great success with getting married. Here is information about his many marriages.
Larry: "... the source of our attraction was that she was lonely just like me. My brother was the best man. Frada and I got an apartment in Queens and a white couch. But it never amounted to anything. We were together for maybe six months."
Wedding Info: Larry and Annette met in 1958 and had a very brief marriage. They divorced in 1962. Annette later married Richard Love.
Larry: "I never told anybody about the first time I got married in Florida. Not even my brother. There was no wedding party. I was this young kid, and I got into an affair with a beautiful woman ten years older than me ... After she got divorced, she told me that she'd done so because of me and insisted that I marry her. She could be very controlling, and I was never good at saying no. We were married at Broward City Hall ... I never lived with her. I can't remember seeing her much after the wedding -- maybe a couple of times. Divorce papers were filed as a matter of course."
Larry: "Because in '61 you got married if you wanted a family." They divorced after having one daughter, King said, because "we really never understood each other."
Source: "One-marriage couples lose out, 3-time groom King says." Logansport Pharos-Tribune. 9/29/1989. pg. 10.
Larry: "I met her [Alene] while I was doing a show at Pumpernik's about Playboy bunnies. She came with her cousin. Alene was too young to be a Bunny at the time ... But she would become one, and I was attracted to her right away."
How Larry and Mickey Met: Mickey met Larry when they were both working at the same Miami radio station.
Wedding Info: Alene and Larry remarried in 1967. Divorce: The second divorce of Larry and Alene was in 1972.
Larry: "When Alene returned from Iowa, the sparks came back from wherever they'd been, and we married again ... My marriage to Alene did not work the second time either."
Larry: "My marriage to Sharon didn't work out ... The real problem was that my relationship with Sharon was either a ten or a a one. It was never a six. Even after Sharon and I divorced, we still dated."
How Julie and Larry Met: Larry met Julie on July 11, 1989 at a charity roast of former 76ers coach Billy Cunningham. According to the August 23, 1989 edition of the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Larry proposed after their first date on August 1, 1989 in Chicago. 
Wedding Info: Julie and Larry were married on October 7, 1989 in a Washington, DC restaurant. Guests at their wedding included Ted Turner, William F. Buckley Jr, Lynda Carter, and New York Governor Mario Cuomo. Paul Anka serenaded them at their wedding.
Divorce: Their marriage was described as "on-again, off-again" and the couple were generally only together on weekends since she kept her residence in Philadelphia and he worked and lived in Washington.  Larry and Julie separated in 1990 and divorced in 1992.
Larry: "This is the first time I'm walking down the aisle with no only someone I love but also someone I adore and who is my friend."
Source: "One-marriage couples lose out, 3-time groom King says." Logansport Pharos-Tribune. 9/29/1989. pg. 10.
Source: "Larry King headed back to divorce court." Elyria Ohio Chronicle Telegram. 11/14/1990. pg. 3.
Walter Scott: "Shortly thereafter [after divorce], Larry King finally admitted what everyone already knew: 'I'm not good at marrying.'"
Larry and Shawn Southwick were married on September 5, 1997. Shawn Southwick and Larry King Marriage Profile
Larry: "I'm not Solomon. But I've had so many experiences as a father. There's a son that I adopted, a daughter that I lost, a son that I found, a daughter, two stepdaughters from my marriage to Sharon who I'm happy to help out whenever I can, a step-son who came aboard with Shawn, plus Chance and Cannon."
Larry: "I think in my life, I have loved three people. Married all three. The other marriages I wasn't in love, it was the thing to do. I used to say, 'what if your wife called urgent, CNN called urgent, there are two lines over there, which would you pick up?'... I used to say CNN, now it would be the wife."
Source: Ashley Reich. "Larry King: Host Opens Up About Divorce, Marriage." HuffingtonPost.com. 12/21/2010.
Chaia King: "This book [Daddy Day, Daughter Day] is dedicated to my parents, who have given me enough love for many lifetimes. I have been blessed to know both of them. They are wonderful people, incredible parents, and two of my best friends. Divorce is a tragedy for many children, but my mother and father treat each other with respect and spend time with me that is filled with love. I hope that divorced parents can strive to love their children freely without placing them in the center of emotional issues. I also hope that children can understand that they are always loved, even if their parents are not together."
Larry: "We are shocked when people marry several times, but if society would admit it, the truth is that many couples who've been married 50 years probably met other people and were afraid to move on. So there may be some envy in our shock, too. There must be some people who get lucky at 20, but that would be the oddity."
Larry: "I don't think I'm suited to marriage. Sometimes I worry I'm too selfish to have a relationship. I think I'm going to be sleeping alone for a while, a long while." 
Larry: "I've always considered myself a good dad. I just wasn't a very good husband. I was always off in my own direction. Even when I was married, a part of me always felt single."
Marty Zeiger: "The thing is, Larry is actually very traditional. He didn't believe in living with women. He married them. So the multiple marriages can be explained in part by what happens when tradition meets impetuousness and restlessness. It was leap before you look."
Herbie Cohen: "... Larry is in love with being in love. If Larry loved someone, instead of sleeping with her, which would be the way most people would handle those situations, Larry married her. Strange as it may seem, getting married that much is his conservatism."
Larry: "When I look back, there are a few regrets. I certainly wouldn't have gotten married eight times. But I don't dwell on regrets."
