=======================================================
Jennifer Anne Garner (born April 17, 1972) is an American actress and film producer. She gained recognition for her performance as CIA officer Sydney Bristow in the ABC thriller drama series Alias, which aired for five seasons from 2001 to 2006. For her work on the series, Garner won a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award.
While working on Alias, she gained roles in movies such as Pearl Harbor (2001), and Catch Me if You Can (2002). Since then, Garner has appeared in supporting as well as lead roles in projects including Daredevil (2003), 13 Going on 30 (2004), Elektra (2005), a spin-off of Daredevil, Juno (2007), The Invention of Lying (2009), The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2012), and Dallas Buyers Club (2013). Garner is married to actor and director Ben Affleck, with whom she has three children.
She was born in Houston, Texas. Her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was an English teacher from Oklahoma, who grew up poor,[1] and her father, William John "Bill" Garner, worked as a chemical engineer. When she was four years old, her father's job with Union Carbide relocated her family to Princeton, West Virginia, and then later to Charleston, West Virginia, where Garner resided until her college years.[2] She has credited her older sister, Melissa Lynn Garner Wylie, who resides in Boston, Massachusetts, as a source of inspiration to her.[3] Her younger sister is Susannah Kay Garner Carpenter.[4]
She began taking ballet lessons at the age of three and continued to dance throughout her youth, but she did not envision herself becoming a classical ballerina.[5] Garner's sheltered upbringing included not wearing make-up or a bikini, going to church every Sunday, and waiting at least until the age of 16 to be allowed to get her ears pierced, which, she later joked, made her family "just a step away from being Amish."[6][7] She said: "I'd hate to say it was strict. It was just not condoned. I never felt hemmed in."[8] Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston and graduated in 1990.[9] She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in drama from Denison University,[10] Granville, Ohio, where she was initiated into the sorority Pi Beta Phi.[11] In the fall of 1993, she studied at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Connecticut.
Garner says she did not plan on becoming an actress: "I wanted to be a doctor, a librarian. ... (Acting) wasn't possible to me. The more I learned what there was to learn about this field, the more hungry I became for it. It comes out of wanting to learn more, as opposed to 'I want to be a star.' I never felt that way," she said.[9]
In 1994, Garner appeared in Atlanta productions of two Shakespeare plays, The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream, by the Georgia Shakespeare Company.[12]
In 1995, Garner started pursuing theater in New York City and earned $150 a week as an understudy in the play A Month in the Country for Roundabout Theatre Company.[3] She was then cast in her first television role as part of a made-for-television movie Zoya, based on the Danielle Steel novel. In the late 1990s, she made brief appearances in individual episodes of Spin City and Law & Order while also securing roles in two short-lived television series, Significant Others and Time of Your Life.
Garner made her feature film debut of the 21st century in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? opposite Ashton Kutcher, playing the girlfriend of Kutcher's character. In 2001, she appeared as the supporting character of a nurse in the big-budget epic Pearl Harbor, starring her future husband Ben Affleck.
Later in 2001, J. J. Abrams, the producer of Felicity, in which Garner had played a recurring role since 1998, approached Garner to audition for the role of Sydney Bristow in his new spy drama Alias. Garner, who up until then had mostly played weepy waifs, did not learn that she "might have to throw a punch or kick" until the first few days of the audition.[13] Told that she "throws like such a girl"[13] and with no background in martial arts or gymnastics, she enrolled in a month-long, private Taekwondo class to prepare for the audition.[13] Even as Garner was cast after several auditions, Abrams revealed that he remained panicked with the thought that she might not be able to pull off the role, especially as, on the first day of shooting, he was told by Garner herself, "I don't think I can do this."[14] Garner later commented, "I was such a girlie-girl then. I didn't even know how to punch."[15] While she performed many of the action sequences during the series herself, the dangerous explosions and complex fights were handled by her stunt double, Shauna Duggins.[16] The first few episodes of season one of Alias, which averaged about 10.2 million weekly viewers,[17] earned Garner the award for "Best Actress in a Television Series — Drama" at the 2002 Golden Globe Awards. Garner's salary for the show began at $40,000 an episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[18] During the show's run, Garner received four consecutive Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama nominations as well as Emmy Award[19] nominations for her lead performance. She won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series in 2005. That same year, during the fourth season, Garner directed the Alias episode "In Dreams", which aired in May. She received producer credit during the series' final season. The series concluded in May 2006 after a shorter fifth season that was abbreviated from 22 to 17 episodes due to Garner's pregnancy, which was written into the season's storyline.[20][21]
After the initial success of Alias, Garner made a big screen cameo in the Steven Spielberg film Catch Me if You Can in 2002; Spielberg had seen her on the show and wanted her to play that small role.[22] Her breakout film role came when she played Ben Affleck's love interest as Elektra Natchios in the action movie Daredevil (2003), an adaptation of the comic book. Garner stated that her training for Daredevil was more gruesome than her work on Alias, and revealed that as she got hung up on wires several times during fight sequences, Affleck became "in charge of reaching up and saving [her]."[23] She was involved in a potentially serious accident on the set of Daredevil when, entangled in wires with her arms stuck and unable to move while doing a flip, she came crashing towards a wall "head-first with such velocity, that [she] was about to smash [her] head into the wall".[24] Recalling how she was rescued by Affleck, she said in 2003, "out of nowhere comes this 6 ft. 4 in. red devil who just kind of put his arms out and shouts: 'I've got her!' I'm telling you, it was like, 'I've got my own superhero.'"[24] While Daredevil got mixed reviews, it was a box office hit.[25]
Garner starred in her first leading role in 13 Going on 30 (2004), a moderate commercial success.[25] Reviewers praised her performance as "radiant"[26] and "effervescent without ever being cloying",[27] and The Christian Science Monitor commented that "while Garner is no Tom Hanks, she's consistently appealing".[28] Her second lead role saw her reprising the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off titled Elektra, a box office disaster that was panned by critics.[29] The Boston Globe stated, "Based on Garner's humorlessness, lack of vocal inflection, and generally bland disposition, "the Way" she has yet to grasp seems to be that of acting,"[30] whereas USA Today concluded that "Jennifer Garner ... is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[31]
Garner performed the Frank Loesser song "My Heart Is So Full of You" on the 2006 charity album Unexpected Dreams – Songs From the Stars. She appeared in the films Catch and Release (2006) and The Kingdom (2007) alongside Jamie Foxx, Jason Bateman and Ashraf Barhom. She then appeared in the Jason Reitman-directed comedy/drama feature Juno, which became a sleeper box office hit, grossing over $230 million from a production budget of $7.5 million.[32] After that film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, Entertainment Weekly declared Garner's work the best female supporting performance of the festival, saying, "The star of Alias and The Kingdom does no butt-kicking in this sweet comedy. Instead, as a young wife desperately hoping to adopt, she's funny, a bit tough, and unbelievably touching."[33]
Garner made her Broadway debut on November 1, 2007, playing Roxanne in Cyrano de Bergerac alongside Kevin Kline at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway.[34] The show was originally set to run until December 23, 2007, but it was extended through January 6, 2008 due to the Broadway stagehand strike in late 2007.[35] In 2010, Garner appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day, directed by Garry Marshall, which also starred Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts, and former Alias co-star Bradley Cooper, Patrick Dempsey among others.[36] She portrayed the girlfriend of Dempsey's character.[37] The film was a commercial success, grossing over $215 million worldwide.[38]
In 2011, she starred in the 2011 remake of Arthur. In that same year, Garner was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[39] In 2012, Garner appeared in the films The Odd Life of Timothy Green and Butter.
Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club, which received positive reviews.[40] On April 24, 2013, Garner began filming Summit and OddLot Entertainment's dramedy Draft Day in New York and Cleveland, Ohio. The film also stars Kevin Costner, was directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, and was released in 2014.[41] In April 2013, Garner joined Steve Carell in the Disney adaption of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.[42] In May 2013, Garner joined the cast of the movie Imagine alongside Al Pacino, Annette Bening, Bobby Cannavale and Michael Caine.[43]P
As of July 17, 2013, Garner is the first and currently only celebrity spokesperson of Max Mara.[44][45] Starting in September, the campaign will appear in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, W, InStyle, The New York Times, and the International Herald Tribune.[45]
In 2006, Garner founded a production company called Vandalia Films. The first film she produced was Butter, released in American theaters in 2012.
Garner is currently on the board of trustess for Save the Children, the American branch of the British children's charity,[1] advocating for early education.[46] She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.[47] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[48] The bill passed in September.[49]
On October 19, 2000, Garner married actor Scott Foley, whom she had met on the set of Felicity in 1998. After separating from Foley in March 2003, she filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences, and the two were officially divorced on March 30, 2004.[50][51] Following her separation, Garner dated her Alias co-star Michael Vartan from August 2003 to March 2004.[52]
Sometime in early to mid-2004, Garner started dating her Daredevil co-star Ben Affleck and the two made their first public appearance as a couple by attending the Boston Red Sox's opening World Series games in October 2004.[53] Since her relationship with Affleck, she has been a tabloid staple.[54] "Ben taught me that you cannot read that stuff, that it's poison," she said in 2009.[55] On her 33rd birthday, Affleck proposed to her with a 4.5 carats (900 mg) diamond ring from Harry Winston.[56] He married Garner, who was then four months pregnant, on June 29, 2005 in a private ceremony in the Caribbean, officiated by family friend and Garner's Alias co-star, Victor Garber,[57] at the Parrot Cay resort on the Turks and Caicos Islands.[58] The couple has three children: daughters Violet Anne Affleck (born December 1, 2005)[59] and Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck (born January 6, 2009),[60][61] and son Samuel Garner Affleck (born February 27, 2012).[62][63]
Garner had been stalked since 2002 by a man, Steven Burky, who was eventually arrested in December 2009, after violating a 2008 restraining order.[64] Burky was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity; in March 2010, he was ruled insane and sent to the California state mental hospital with a court order to stay away from the Affleck family for 10 years if released from the hospital.[65]
In 2002, Garner topped the Maxim Hot 100 list.[66] In December 2007, Garner was named The Charleston Sunday Gazette-Mail's 2007 West Virginian of the Year "for her dedication, work ethic and unique role as role model and ambassador for West Virginia."[67] People named her one of 2012 Most Beautiful at Every Age.[68]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Jennifer Garner, who has catapulted into stardom with her lead role on the television series Alias (2001), has come a long way from her birthplace of Houston, Texas. Raised in Charleston, West Virginia by her mother Pat, a retired English teacher, and her father, Bill, a former chemical engineer, Jennifer was the middle sibling of three girls. She spent nine years of her adolescence studying ballet and describes her years in dance as ones characterized by determination rather than talent, being driven mostly by a love of the stage.Jennifer took this determination with her when she enrolled at Denison University as a chemistry major, a decision that was later changed to a drama major when she found that her passions for the stage were stronger than her love of science. New York attracted the young actress after college where she worked as a hostess while pursuing a career in film and television. Her most recent move has been to Los Angeles, a decision that led to a role on the television series Felicity (1998), where she met her future husband Scott Foley. The couple divorced in 2004.Jennifer appears on television as Agent Sydney Bristow, who works for the Central Intelligence Agency. For her work, Garner has received four consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She has also received four Golden Globe nominations and won once, as well as received two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and won once. She has appeared in numerous other television production as well as such films as Elektra (2005), 13 Going on 30 (2004), Daredevil (2003), Pearl Harbor (2001) and Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). Aside from filming Alias (2001), Jennifer enjoys cooking, gardening, hiking, and inspired by her character on the series, kickboxing.
      Used to be a hostess at Isabella's restaurant in New York when she was trying to launch her acting career.
      Early in the filming of Daredevil (2003), while doing a stunt, she became tangled in the wires that were helping her do a flip and nearly crashed into a wall she was supposed to flip off. Ben Affleck, in his Daredevil costume, rushed up to her, grabbed her and pulled her away from the wall before she hit it. She later commented, "It was like he was Superman.".
      Following the terrorist attack on the United States on September 11th, 2001, she recorded a promotional video for the Central Intelligence Agency that was available at www.cia.gov/employment.
Alias (2001) creator J.J. Abrams gave her a pink bicycle for her birthday. Being the first one on set, she would often greet the show's production crew by ringing the bells on the bike's handlebars.

      One of her call signs on Alias (2001) is "Mountaineer". She was raised in West Virginia, and the Mountaineer is the mascot of West Virginia University.
      While filming a sai/sword fight in Elektra (2005), accidentally got her knuckles sliced by Will Yun Lee. She got her knuckles patched up, and when she and Lee resumed, he subsequently sliced her again in the exact same spot.
      Her husband Ben Affleck was her co-star in Daredevil (2003). The two met on the set of the movie Pearl Harbor (2001) but wouldn't become a couple until Affleck's very public relationship with singer/actress Jennifer Lopez ended.

      One of her more unique roles is as the face of recruitment for the CIA, hosting a promotional video aimed at young professionals whom the agency would like to interest in a career.
      Appeared with husband Ben Affleck in two movies, Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003). It would have been three, but Affleck's small scene in Elektra (2005), was cut from the final film.

      [on Alias (2001) co-star Carl Lumbly.] We looked him up on IMDb, and we just cracked up - his resumé goes on and on. He was even on Cagney & Lacey (1981).
      [on being recognized] I never get recognized! I'll be with my husband [actor Scott Foley from Felicity (1998)] and people will think I'm his manager, and they'll start giving me their business cards.
      [on winning a Golden Globe] My husband was as flabbergasted as I was. I think he almost flew out of his skin, he was so surprised and excited. He is just the most supportive and proud friend. My family is just beyond out-of-control excited.
      Two of my mom's most oft-repeated mom-isms are: "Happiness is your own responsibility" and "Weeping may last through the night, but joy comes in the morning." Both are true.

      I think he's brilliant at what he does, but why rock the boat? It works between us pretty well the way it is. I don't know if I want to go to work with him. I'd be like, "Okay already, you got the shot. Let's go home!" -- on the prospects of working with husband Ben Affleck again.
      [on getting her ears pierced in January 2009] My sister Melissa had been thinking about getting her ears pierced for a while, but was a bit nervous about having them done - She'd never had them done even though she's thirty-nine, and was worried about it hurting. My other sister, Susannah, has had her ears pierced since she was fourteen, and I'd had mine done a couple of times in the past, but let them grow over again both times. We both told her she'd nothing to worry about and it didn't hurt at all, so she said she'd trust us and get them done - but only if I went with her and got mine done too. So she watched me get my ears pierced, and then she finally got hers done too.

                The features of a prom queen and the fighting prowess of an action hero merge to create the killer combination that is Jennifer Garner. The all-American starlet may have a weakness for her leading men, but has never let this, nor anything else, stand in the way of her steady climb to the top.Jennifer Anne Garner’s wholesome upbringing in Princeton, West Virginia, is reflected in one very prominent feature: her ears. Born on 17 April 1972, the daughter of Methodists, Patricia Ann Garner and William John Garner, has never pierced her ears as she says her parents would disapprove. As the middle daughter between the older Melissa and the rebellious Susannah, Garner studied ballet from the age of three and went on to appear, but not always star, in local musicals such as ‘Little Abner’. Yet, even these first ventures on stage did not instil in the George Washington High School graduate a desire to become a performer. The self-proclaimed “happy nerd” felt far removed from the world she saw on television and harboured no ambition to enter it. It was only whilst studying chemistry at Denison University that the Phi Beta Pi sorority member realised her love of the theatre and changed her major to drama. In the course of earning her bachelor degree in fine art, the former dancer also enrolled in the O’Neal National Theatre Institute for the 1993 semester, presaging her future fame as an action heroine by studying fight choreography under the tuition of David Chandler. However, Garner did not capitalise on her combat skills immediately. Thinking she would “graduate, work in theatre, get married, have kids”, the aspiring thespian moved to New York and worked as a waitress whilst understudying for the 1995 Roundabout Theatre Company production of ‘A Month in the Country’. Realising that her sojourn in the Big Apple would bear little acting fruit, the aspiring actress soon moved to Los Angeles, where she made her first forays into television. A small part in Hallmark’s 1995 TV adaptation of Danielle Steele’s ‘Zoya’ and guest appearances on popular shows in 1996 such as ‘Spin City’ (1996) and ‘Law and Order’ (1990) initiated Garner into the acting profession and kindled her relationship with the small screen.That same year saw Garner adopt a multifaceted approach to the industry, supplementing her television appearances with movie roles. In addition to her return to the Hallmark Channel in ‘Harvest of Fire’ (1996), that year also marked her big screen debut with a small part in Jan Krawitz’s ‘In Harm’s Way’ (1996). Further roles followed in 1997 such as that of Stacey Sampanahodrita in Leslie Nielsen’s comedy, ‘Mr. Magoo’ (1997), yet the limelight still evaded the 25-year-old. Garner finally seemed to achieve star status in 1998, earning a leading role as Nell in the television drama, ‘Significant Others’. However, her success was short-lived as the series was cancelled after only six episodes. It was in fact a recurring role in the Golden Globe-winning show, ‘Felicity’ (1998) that gained her the attention of Hollywood executives. Her performance as the girlfriend of Scott Foley’s character paved the way to her earning the supporting role of Romy in Fox’s ‘Party of Five’ (1994) spin-off, ‘Time of Your Life’ (1999). However, the consequences of her appearance on the ‘Felicity’ lasted far longer than this later series and whilst ‘Time of Your Life’ was cancelled by the end of 2001, the effects of ‘Felicity’ continued to reverberate in Garner’s life for years to come. In a personal capacity, art began to melt into real life as Garner’s on-screen chemistry with Scott Foley progressed into their real life romance and subsequent marriage on 19 October 2000. The newly-wed returned to film and began to earn roles in major releases. She appeared as Ashton Kutcher’s long-suffering girlfriend in ‘Dude, Where's My Car?’ (2000) and was introduced to a young actor called Ben Affleck whilst playing the nurse Sandra in the blockbuster ‘Pearl Harbour’ (2001). It was during this period that, unbeknownst to Garner, further professional implications of her stint in ‘Felicity’ were beginning to crystallise. The show’s producer, JJ Abrams, was in the process of creating a new television drama about a student who becomes a double agent for the Central Intelligence Agency. Searching for a girl who could portray a combination of innocence, sophistication and ruthlessness, Abrams immediately cast his mind back to Garner. After gruelling auditions where the combat-trained actress demonstrated her fighting prowess, he cast her as the lead character in what was to be named ‘Alias’ (2001). It was this incarnation as Sydney Bristow which would prove a culmination of her years of training and cement her as an icon of the small screen.‘Alias’ premiered in 2001, instantly earning Garner strong reviews. Entertainment Weekly proclaimed that she was “exceptionally adroit” as the action star, whilst USA Today has compared her to Diane Rigg of ‘The Avengers’ (1961), declaring her the “sexiest spy since Emma Peel”. Unlike Garner’s previous endeavours, ‘Alias’ proved it could withstand both audience and studio scrutiny to evade the axe of cancellation. With ratings averaging 8.8 million viewers per episode, the show lasted five years and five seasons. The success took its toll on the star’s marriage and, citing “irreconcilable differences”, Garner and Foley divorced in 2003. The tabloids were quick to blame the marital failure on Garner’s new relationship with actor, Michael Vartan. However, despite the fact that Garner had indeed become involved with her ‘Alias’ co-star, Foley was quick to defend his ex, issuing a statement confirming that it was the pressure of ‘Jen’ becoming a “huge celebrity” and not infidelity, which had ended the union. By the time of its conclusion in 2006, ‘Alias’ had accumulated numerous awards, as did its star. In 2002, the actress won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Drama Series, followed the next year with a Saturn Award for Best Actress in a Television series and a Screen Actors Guild Award in 2005. She was also nominated for an Emmy four years in a row. Garner was quick to realise that the show’s popularity was her key to a wider audience and refused to rest on her laurels. She dedicated her time away from small-screen international espionage to infiltrating the world of film. After a slow start with a cameo in Leonardo DiCaprio’s blockbuster, ‘Catch Me if You Can’ (2002), Garner began to reap the rewards of her television celebrity status. Following a hotly contested casting search in which she was reportedly pitched against actresses such as Jessica Alba and Natalie Portman, Garner landed the role of Elektra Natchios in ‘Daredevil’ (2003). This marked a reunion with Ben Affleck, who would star as the blind vigilante. The actress has described how she embraced the character’s “tenderness and the blissfulness of falling in love, and also her vengeful darker side”, despite admitting that the physical elements in the film were the hardest thing she has ever had to do.Critics, including the BBC’s Nev Pierce, praised the movie, with Pierce proclaiming it a “solid, enjoyable actioner, which should please fan and philistine alike“. Indeed, with total worldwide takings of $179 million, the adaptation raced to number one on the films chart, staying there for three consecutive weeks. Garner’s physical and emotional dedication to the role was also rewarded with rave reviews and an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female. Rumour was rife that, like her comic book counterpart, Elektra was due a spin-off movie. Even Variety, which derided the film as a “charm- and humor-free exercise in pushing commercial buttons“, commended Garner as having “no trouble holding her own” in the midst of the celebrity cast. However, no higher praise was showered on the actress than by her co-star. Affleck gushed to MTV that "Jennifer's great, she's fabulous" and joked that she was a better fighter than him. Affleck’s esteem for the actress was clear for all to see, but with both actors involved with other people, the pair parted from ‘Daredevil’ as merely friends. Whilst Affleck went on to make film failures, such as ‘Jersey Girl’ (2004), Garner was due more box office success. With her credentials as a screen fighter established, Garner’s next move was to prove herself as a comedic talent. Drawing on her wholesome childhood, Garner starred as a 13-year-old girl who wakes up as her 30-year-old counterpart after wishing it to be so, in the romantic comedy ‘13 Going On 30’ (2004). Harking back to Tom Hanks’s 1988 smash, ‘Big’, the film was well received. Whilst seemingly dwarfed by the $129,042,871 worldwide takings earned by its counterpart, ‘Mean Girls’ (2004), the film held its own with a respectable gross of $96,455,697. For Garner, the change of genre exposed her to a different audience, widening her appeal. Interviews with Teen Hollywood were accompanied by 2004 nominations for the Teen Choice Awards, People Choice Awards and MTV Movie Awards, signalling the arrival of a younger fan base. That year also marked a significant step in Garner’s personal life. Following her split from Vartan and the demise of Affleck’s relationship with Jennifer Lopez, the pair were seemingly single by the time their second Marvel Comics adaptation was released on 14 January 2005. ‘Elektra’ (2005) confirmed the rumours of a spin-off for Garner’s character in ‘Daredevil’ and saw the actress reprise her role as the red-leather-clad heroine with a tragic past. Despite the film’s derision by critics, Garner’s talent shone through and she was awarded 2005’s People’s Choice Award for Favourite Female Action Star.Even with its bad press, it is unlikely that Garner regrets her involvement with the ‘Daredevil’ project, for it brought with it some surprising off-screen developments. On 30 June 2005, after months of speculation, USA Today reported that Garner had wed Ben Affleck and was expecting his child. As Garner’s bump grew, Abrams incorporated his star’s pregnancy into the final season of ‘Alias’, insisting that she would play Sydney Bristow to the end. The hard working actress also honoured her filming commitments to the romantic comedy ‘Catch and Release’ (2007), continuing to perform whilst pregnant. Garner gave birth to daughter, Violet Anne Affleck, on 1 December 2005. The proud parent immersed herself in motherhood and marriage, and fans may have been disappointed by her absence from the big screen in 2006. The next year, Garner hit the ground running with three cinematic contributions. After receiving critical acclaim for ‘Catch and Release’, the energetic mother joined Jamie Foxx in the fast paced ‘The Kingdom’ (2007). Calling it the “perfect mom movie”, Garner was able to portray FBI forensic examiner Janet Mayes whilst nursing Violet between takes. The actress also found time that year to offer what the New York Times referred to as a “captivating” performance with Kevin Kline in a Broadway production of ‘Cyrano de Bergerac’ (2007) as well as setting up her own production company, Vandalia Films. Crowning her 2007 achievements was her role in Jason Reitman’s Academy Award-winning, ‘Juno’ (2007). Garner’s portrayal of the meticulous wife desperate for a child won her the glowing praise of a variety of publications, even melting the hearts of some of the toughest critics in the business. With The Wall Street Journal attributing one mall scene she shares with the film’s star, Ellen Page, as “the most exquisite scene in this exceptional movie”, Garner’s reputation as a credible actress solidified. History repeated itself in 2008 with Garner and Affleck refusing to comment on the emergence of a bump on the svelte star’s stomach. It was Garner’s former ‘Alias’ co-star Victor Garber who accidentally confirmed that the power couple were indeed expecting their second child. Jennifer Garner has launched a career which has seen her graduate from the innocent naiveté of her days on the Hallmark Channel to the highest echelons of Hollywood. Her 2008 standing as Forbes’ 70th most powerful celebrity surely reflects the successful, but understated manner in which Garner has oscillated from television to film in the piecemeal development of her reputation as one of the industry’s brightest stars.  The actress starred in romantic comedy 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past' with Matthew McConaughey in 2009, followed by the 'Invention of Lying' opposite Ricky Gervais the same year. The film was set in a world where no-one lies. Jennifer also gave birth to her second daughter with Ben Affleck at the start of 2009. They named her Seraphina. She then appeared in the romantic comedy 'Valentine's Day' in 2010 alongside Jessica Alba, Bradley Cooper and Jamie Foxx in the story featuring intertwining couples and singletons on the most romantic day of the year. In 2011, she appeared in 'Arthur' with Russell Brand and has recently attended the premiere of her new film 'Butter' in Toronto. The couple announced they were expecting their third child together in August 2011, with the birth expected early in 2012. Jennifer said of her third pregnancy: "Find ways to be as comfortable as possible and just go with it. It's not an illness, being pregnant. I'm in the easiest part of it."

=======================================================
Jennifer   Anne Garner was born on April 17, 1972 in Houston, Texas to Bill & Pat Garner.   Bill is a retired chemical engineer and Pat is a retired college English teacher.   Her parents were always supportive of Jennifer and helped her to pursue her   dreams. "My parents never said anything except, ‘Go for it.’" While   growing up Jennifer studied ballet for six hours a day which helped teach her   discipline that would help her later in life.
    Jennifer is the middle daughter. She has always had a close relationship with   her two sisters, Melissa (who is older) and Suzannah (who is younger). Even   though Jennifer has said "We did have raging fights about [borrowing clothes]   and using the phone". You can tell that Jennifer really respects and admires   her sisters. "My big sister Melissa, is such a stud and my little sister   Suzannah, has always had a perfect body and big blue eyes. We were a force."   The family often has foreign exchange students in their home, so Jen often shared   a room with her sister Melissa. Melissa was the class valedictorian and a champion   majorette. Jennifer wanted to stand out so she took up the saxophone and joined   the swim team.
    Jennifer graduated from George Washington High School in the class of 1990 and   went on to attend Denison University. She started college majoring in Chemistry.   She later changed her major to drama when she realized that her passion for   the stage outweighed her love of science. After graduating from Denison in 1994   she headed to New York City to pursue her career. When she first moved to NYC,   she got a job being an understudy in a play earning $150 a week. "I would   roll up pennies to take the subway to work in Times Square. I was broke, but   I was happy." It might not have been easy, but it was here that Jen scored   her first television role as Melissa Gilbert’s daughter on the miniseries "Zoya"   based on Danielle Steel’s book. The next few roles that Jennifer received were   in two Hallmark Hall of Fame films, "Harvest of Fire" and "Rose   Hill". Jennifer did a few other feature films before landing her first   role on a television series, "Significant Others". The show started   during mid-season and didn’t do well in its time slot and was quickly cancelled.   "I loved this show. It was well written and I loved the guys. We had a   blast. I was really bummed when it was cancelled."
  The next step in Jennifer’s life was to move to Los Angeles (following a boyfriend,   which didn’t work out) where she got a job as a hostess at the restaurant Isabella’s.   It was then that things started to change for Jen as she got a role on the WB   series, "Felicity" as Hanna Bibb, the girlfriend of Noel played by   Scott Foley. The role as Hanna Bibb helped Jennifer get some recognition, but   it also helped her meet the man who would later become her husband.
    "I was definitely attracted to him at first sight, but I didn’t realize   I was going to marry him until a while in. It grew really gradually and sweetly,   and it was a real courtship." The couple started dating and a few months   into the relationship they went to Paris together. A year into the relationship   they bought a house together. When they had been dating for two years Scott   proposed to Jennifer. Jen was shocked to say the least. "I knew we were   going to marry someday, but I was absolutely surprised when he actually proposed.   And surprised he had bought a ring. I ran around the yard screaming." Six   weeks later the couple married in a small backyard wedding on October 19, 2000.   
 Meanwhile,   Jennifer’s career was moving along as she was cast as Romy the roommate to Jennifer   Love Hewitt’s Sarah, on the spin-off series "The Time of Your Life".   Unfortunately, this series was cancelled also, due to low ratings. Jen next   went on to star in a film as the frustrated girlfriend to Ashton Kutcher’s character   in "Dude, Where’s My Car?" "It was so fun. We were just goofy.   It’s amazing, no matter how full your resume is, this is the first credit people   go to because everyone loves the title." Jen was also cast in the Michael   Bay film "Pearl Harbor" as the third lead for a female as Nurse Sandra,   a kind of geeky and serious nurse. "I loved making this movie because you   usually never work with a group of women, and I loved that we just had women   together every day at work. Kate was so fun."
  The next step in the right direction was when J.J. Abrams, the producer of Felicity   approached Jennifer with a new show that he was working on. He thought that   Jennifer would be right for and encouraged her to audition. When she heard about   the role on Alias, Jennifer decided to start taking Tae Kwon Do lessons. She   pulled out yellow pages and found Master Yu and started taking lessons daily   for an hour a day. She attended numerous auditions over the course of a month   and was really excited to be able to show off her martial art skills at her   last audition.
 She   got the part as Sydney Bristow, student by day, double agent the rest of the   time. Jennifer does a lot of the stunts that Alias requires herself, unless   as she puts it they are crazy, then she has a stunt double do them. But it took   a while, "I did go overboard. We shot the scene where I was in the shower,   and I was so bruised we had to cover my bruises with tattoo paint – they were   just huge." Unlike Jennifer’s past series, this one was a hit.
    And to prove it, Jen won a Golden Globe in January of 2002. She wowed many people   with her sincere acceptance speech, she thanked her mom & dad, her cast,   and "Uh, I’ve often said to J.J Abrams, the creator of the show, I don’t   know why you cast me in this role, I don’t know why you thought I could do it.   I know I was good in Dude Where’s My Car, but seriously… I, I can’t thank   you enough, for believing in me, and for fighting for me, and, and writing what   you write. Um, and the most significant thing you did to change my life was   introduce me to my husband, the most handsome date in the room…and a man who   made me feel confident and beautiful long before I started walking like Sydney   Bristow."
Jennifer continued to grow in popularity with fans and filmmakers, as she took   on roles in Steven Speilberg’s "Catch Me If You Can" opposite Leonardo   DiCaprio and in the film "Daredevil" as assassin, Elektra opposite   Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell. For her role as Elektra, Jennifer studied with   martial arts choreographer, Cheung Yan Yang and trainer Don Lee. "I love   this physical stuff which is why I wanted to do Daredevil because I wanted to   learn what Daredevil could teach me."
  Unfortunately in March of 2003 Jen & Scott announced that they were separating.   When asked why it didn’t work Jennifer explained, "Honestly, I just don’t   have enough perspective on it yet … I think there are a million reasons why   things don’t work. The thing is, everyone says that when you’re in Hollywood,   you’re living in the fast lane, but that’s what it feels like — everything   speeds up. If a (relationship) is not going to work 10 years from now, it feels   like it’s accelerated to this frenzy and then, it’s not working — boom! And   you’re like, ‘What just happened?’"
    Jennifer’s next starred in her first romantic comedy, "13 Going on 30"   opposite Mark Ruffalo. "It’s … the female version of Big. But it’s a   movie with a lot of heart, and it should be funny." With the role as Jenna,   Jennifer proved that she could carry a film by herself and show her comedic   side.
Jennifer’s next relationship was with her Alias co-star Michael Vartan whom   she claimed at the time was her best friend. The couple dated for about a year   when their split was announced. 
Sometime   in 2004, Jennifer started dating her Daredevil co-star, Ben Affleck. The couple   kept their relationship private but could be found attending Boston Red Sox   baseball games in Ben’s hometown.
In January of 2005 hit theaters in a reprise of her role as Elektra in the   sequel to "Daredevil", "Elektra". 
The year 2005 brought a lot of changes and additions to Jennifer’s personal   life. In June, Jen married her boyfriend actor Ben Affleck on June 29, 2005   in the Caribbean islands. Jennifer described the event, "We were able to   have a beautiful, private wedding, and I couldn’t be happier." 
During   the summer they announced the news that they were expecting their first child   at the end of the year. The couple kept tight lipped about the sex of the baby   until Jen accidentally slipped during an interview with Jay Leno that the baby   was a "she". Violet Anne was born on December 1, 2005 at 3:26 p.m.   and weighed 6 lbs. 14 oz.
2006 brought the fifth and final season of Jen’s hit television series, "Alias".   During the last season Jen was unable to do a lot of her own stunts as she had   done in the past due to her pregnancy, which was written into the story line.   At the end of the year the film "Charlotte’s Web" will be released   with Jennifer as the voice of Susy.
During the summer of 2006, Ben, Jennifer, & Violet lived in Boston as Ben   directed the film "Gone, Baby, Gone". 
2007 brings on some new projects. The film "Catch and Release" which   is scheduled to be released in January, where Jen stars along side Timothy Olyphant,   Juliette Lewis, & Kevin Smith. And "The Kingdom" which is with   Jamie Foxx and is scheduled for release in April.
 This biography was written by Ali   exclusively for Jen-Garner.net in December of 2004 and it was last updated in   August of 2006.

Birth Name: Jennifer Anne GarnerBirth Place: Houston, TXDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 04/17/1972, AriesProfession: Actor
An athletic, dimpled girl-next-door beauty, Jennifer Garner first captured the public's attention playing Scott Foley's on-screen love interest on the television drama Felicity. The role brought her both personal and professional successes. Off-screen, she became romantically involved with Foley, and the two eventually wed. Also impressed with her was Felicity co-creator J.J. Abrams, who cast her as tough spy Sydney Bristow on his ABC series Alias. When the show debuted in 2001, its popularity made Garner a household name. As her career heated up, her marriage to Foley cooled off and she was briefly linked with her Alias costar Michael Vartan. A supporting role as Elektra in the 2003 film Daredevil led to her own starring vehicle (2005's Elektra), and introduced her to costar Ben Affleck. In 2005, she and Affleck tied the knot and welcomed the birth of their first child. When Alias ended its five-season run in 2006, she switched her career focus to films with the release 2007's Catch and Release. She continued to charm audiences with likeable roles in the 2009 romantic comedies The Invention of Lying and Ghost of Girlfriends Past.
