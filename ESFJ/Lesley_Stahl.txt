Lesley Rene Stahl[1] (born December 16, 1941) is an American television journalist. Since 1991, she has reported for CBS on 60 Minutes.
Stahl was born in Lynn, Massachusetts and raised in Swampscott, Massachusetts. She is of Jewish heritage, the daughter of Dorothy J. (née Tishler), and Louis E. Stahl, a food company executive.[1][2][3] In 1977, Stahl married author Aaron Latham. They have one child, Taylor Stahl Latham. The couple currently lives in New York.
An honors graduate of Wheaton College who majored in History,[4] Stahl began her television broadcasting career at Boston's original Channel 5, WHDH-TV as a producer and on-air reporter.[5] She joined CBS News in 1972, and became a correspondent in 1974. "I was born on my 30th birthday," Stahl would later write about the experience. "Everything up till then was prenatal."[6] Stahl credits her CBS News hire to the Federal Communication Commission's 1972 inclusion of women in its affirmation action mandate: "the television networks were scouring the country for women and blacks with any news experience at all. A friend in New York had called to tell me about a memo floating around CBS News mandating that 'the next reporter we hire will be a woman.'"[7] According to Stahl, Connie Chung and Bernard Shaw were "the two other 'affirmative action babies' in what became known as the Class of '72."[8]
Stahl's prominence grew after she covered the Watergate affair.[9] She went on to become White House correspondent during the presidencies of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. At the Republican Convention of 1980, she broke the news on CBS that Reagan's negotiations with ex-President Ford had broken down and the answer to the question of who would be vice-presidential nominee was: "It's Bush! Yes, it's Bush!" George H. W. Bush had been standing perhaps not far away, largely off by himself, looking discouraged because he was sure he wasn't going to be chosen.
Stahl was the moderator of Face the Nation between September 1983 and May 1991. In addition, from 2002–2004, she hosted 48 Hours Investigates. In 2002, Stahl made headlines when Al Gore appeared on 60 Minutes and revealed for the first time that he would not run for president again in 2004. When Katie Couric was hired, CBS News asked Stahl to reduce her salary by $500,000 to accommodate Couric's salary, bringing her salary down to $1.8 million.[10][11] In October 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France, stood up and walked away from an interview with Stahl, because she asked him about his relationship with his soon-to-be estranged spouse.[12]
In 1998, she appeared in an episode of Frasier, playing herself in the episode "Desperately Seeking Closure." She is well known for her trademark red lipstick.
I had decided by August 1989, in my 48th year, that I had already had the best day of my life. [. . .] Then we went to Rwanda to see the mountain gorillas, Dian Fossey's gorillas in the mist. [. . .] After two and a half hours [. . .] there they were: two baby gorillas frolicking like any four-year-olds. We snapped and stared. We were right there, in their lives, in the middle of their open-air house. And then the silverback, the patriarch, seemed to welcome us, as three females kept grooming him. [. . .] We spent one hour in their world, watching them tumble and wrestle, nurse their babies, swing in the trees, forage for food—vines, leaves, berries— [. . .] so close that a female reached out to touch me. When I went to reciprocate, the guide hit my arm with a stick. "Non, madame. C'est inderdit." [. . .] What I decided that day with the gorillas in Rwanda was that the best day of your life may not have happened yet. No matter what you think.[13]
She received a Doctorate of Humane Letters honoris causa from Colgate University in 2008[14] and a Doctorate of Humane Letters honoris causa from Loyola College in Maryland in 2008.
Lesley Stahl is one of the founding members, along with Liz Smith, Mary Wells Lawrence, and Joni Evans, of wowOwow.com, a website for women to talk about culture, politics, and gossip[citation needed].

=======================================================
Mike Wallace, Howard Stern–what’s the difference? There is none. Not really. Not anymore. Everybody confesses everything now, and no topic is out of bounds when the camera light goes on.
All right, let’s back up for a moment. On the night of Jan. 6, 60 Minutes correspondent Leslie Stahl paid a visit to Diane Sawyer on ABC’s 20/20 to plug her new book, Reporting Live. Ms. Stahl more or less told Ms. Sawyer that her devotion to big-time TV journalism made her a rotten wife and mother. Ms. Sawyer mentioned that she once saw Ms. Stahl crying on the phone in the White House press room. And on and on, la-di-da, anything to promote a book, right?
The conversation eventually turned to Ms. Stahl’s husband, Urban Cowboy screenwriter Aaron Latham, and how depressed he was for, oh, about three years in the 80′s. Ms. Stahl was telling Ms. Sawyer about how her colleague Mike Wallace set her straight, instructing her to make sure that she got some help for her husband. At this point in the 20/20 interview, Ms. Sawyer and Ms. Stahl visited Mr. Wallace in his office over at CBS. He was seated behind his desk, looking great as usual. The ladies looked frightened to be in his presence. Ms. Sawyer asked Mr. Wallace to recall the stern advice he had given to Ms. Stahl all those years ago, and he happily obliged, in that million-dollar voice of his: “‘You’ve got to see that he goes!’” Mr. Wallace said, meaning that Mr. Latham go see a psychiatrist. “And he did.”
Then, there was this little nugget of conversation between Ms. Stahl and Mr. Wallace, with America listening in.
Lesley Stahl: “No.” (Here, Ms. Stahl looked startled–but quickly recalling Mr. Wallace’s own battle with depression and use of antidepressants, she fired back.) “Did it ruin yours?”
Mike Wallace: “For a long time, yes.” (The man said these words with a twinkle, so that his meaning was clear: Those sexual difficulties are all in the past, and the old rascal is back!)
To its credit, 20/20 gave Mr. Latham the last word on Mr. Wallace: “He’s a strange guy,” Mr. Latham said. “But I owe a lot to him. Lesley says he can’t speak at her funeral. You just–you don’t know what he’s going to say!”
Tonight, Mr. Wallace, that octogenarian rogue, is supposed to show up for the debut of 60 Minutes II. (By the way, shouldn’t it be 60 Minutes 2? We’re tempted to call it 60 Minutes the Second, given those Roman numerals–but I guess CBS went with the Roman numerals thinking they’re freakin’ claaaaaaaaaasssy.) The executive producer of 60 Minutes II said the correspondents from the original 60 Minutes will do segments updating their Sunday segments. Mr. Wallace did the District Council 37 union scandal his last time out, on Jan. 10, a story we’ve had enough of by now, although it’s fascinating and all that. All right, so tune in tonight to see how Charlie Rose, Vicki Mabrey and Bob Simon perform after the ticking of the stopwatch. [WCBS, 2, 9 P.M.]
Marv Albert has been quietly making a comeback. First, by hosting MSG’s Sportsdesk program and now by coming out with a Sportsdesk segment, a featured series called “The Peripheral Opponent,” about New York coaches and their relationship to the city. [Madison Square Garden, 32, 10:30 P.M.]
Can’t Hardly Wait is billed as a vehicle for Jennifer Love Hewitt. Unfortunately, it’s more of a vehicle for some guy named Ethan Embry, who plays the fellow who thought he could never land the lady, but … hey, you’ll have to pay to view it. It’s on pay-per-view. [Time Warner Home Theater, 60, all day.]
What you’ll get on tonight’s free night of the Movie Channel’s free weekend of movies: My Best Friend’s Wedding (expertly shot, but needs a few more laughs), The Game (not bad, coulda been scarier, saw the ending coming about a half-hour in advance) and U-Turn (Oliver Stone’s grimy energetic B-movie, with Sean Penn goin’ nuts). Not bad! [The Movie Channel, 49, 7 P.M. to 1:30 A.M.]
Garth Ancier, formerly president of entertainment at WB, is now the executive consultant at the station until his contract runs out in February … and he can pursue other jobs … like the one waiting for him at NBC.
“My favorite show of all time is The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which I guess is fairly typical for someone of my age. I’m 41.”
“The lineup that CBS had on Saturday nights when I was a kid. It was All in the Family , M*A*S*H , The Mary Tyler Moore Show , The Bob Newhart Show , leading into The Carol Burnett Show . That’s like your all-time great television night, and you compare that to what you see now on Saturday-night network television today. There’s almost nothing to watch.”
“I don’t really know. The networks’ new shows by and large look so stale. Every so often you’ll have a show that breaks out. To me, it doesn’t make any sense to always do shows that are duplicates of shows that are done before.”
What’s the deal with the WB’s show Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane? Why did you change the name from Zoe Bean ?
“We tested the show and we discovered that it was viewed much better as an ensemble, rather than as a show just about Zoe. They said it looked more like Friends.” [WPIX, 11, 9 P.M.]
“Thankfully,” he said, “I got a job on a big movie, so I’m not feeling as bereft as I did at the moment when I found out that we were shit-canned.”
“Well, what happened was, we shot the last show on the Tuesday night before Christmas. We were gonna have a break for two weeks and come back and shoot more episodes. But in an effort to wish us a merry Christmas, the NBC executives pulled aside the creator of our show, Marco Pennette, and told him at about 11:30 that night, ‘You guys are not coming back to shoot any more Conrad Blooms.’ Now, Marco didn’t tell us that night, to save us our Christmas vacation. He indulged us in 24 hours free. So I flew back to New York for my father’s birthday, and we’re going out to dinner as a family and I still didn’t know, and then my father pulls the car aside. We had just come from Peter Luger, enjoying a lovely steak dinner for four. We pulled up at 44th and Eighth at a light, and my dad says out of nowhere–I mean, it was a complete non sequitur to what we had been talking about–and he says, ‘Mark, the show’s been canceled.’”
“He listened to the message in which I would have found out had I listened to my messages when I arrived home, but I didn’t.”
What will replace Conrad Bloom? Ah, just shove Caroline in the City in its slot, see what happens. [WNBC, 4, 8:30 P.M.]
Richard Grieco starred opposite Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street. But while Mr. Depp went on to fame and glory, Mr. Grieco never made it. His spinoff Booker was canned after a season. His foray into the motion picture business, with Tomcat: Dangerous Desires, Mutual Needs and Sinbad: The Battle of the Dark Knights, didn’t fare much better. Meanwhile, off screen, Mr. Grieco boozed it up with Mickey Rourke until he ended up in rehab.
“Yeah, I was going through my period of insanity,” Mr. Grieco said. “I’m still insane, I just toned it down a lot. That was back in those days with the Harley, when people were actually riding them. There were about 10 of us riding around. I haven’t talked to him in a long time, though.” Falling out? “A little bit, nothing major. If I saw him on the street right now, I’d go up to him with a big hug and a kiss.”
Now Mr. Grieco is back for another ride on the merry-go-round, starring with Baywatch mama Yasmine Bleeth in a made-for-TV movie called Ultimate Deception.
“I did it as a favor for a friend of mine who was directing it,” he said. “He asked me to do a couple of days on it. And I said, ‘Why?’ and he said, ‘Well, just help me out here, because we need a name to sell it.’ I said, ‘Ah, sure. I don’t care.’ But I’m done doing people favors.” [USA, 23, 9 P.M.]
In the 50′s, the conventional critical wisdom about Alfred Hitchcock–the centenary of whose birth will be much celebrated this year–was that his best work was done in England in the 30′s, while in truth much of his best work was done in America in the 50′s. That was the decade of such extremely personal, if not especially successful, pictures as I Confess (1953) and Vertigo (1958), as well as such popular vintage achievements as Rear Window (1954) and North by Northwest (1959). The movie that kicked off this amazing cycle, though a substantial hit in its time and certainly among his finest, is for some reason rarely cited as such these days, 1951′s rivetingly suspenseful Strangers on a Train [Sunday, Jan. 17, Cinemax, 29, noon; also on videocassette] . Maybe this is because it’s in black-and-white and boasts no enduring superstar like Cary Grant or James Stewart. Nevertheless, it remains among his most fully realized and unsettling thrillers, with at least three memorably effective sequences and featuring one of the most brilliantly subversive performances in any Hitchcock movie.
Prior to Strangers, Robert Walker had been almost as much identified as the all-American boy next door as Anthony Perkins had before Hitch cast him in Psycho (1960). Walker was an especially personable actor–his most defining role being the young soldier who falls for Judy Garland in Vincente Minnelli’s lovely wartime fable, The Clock (1944)–and Hitchcock here used his indisputable likability and charm to a superbly perverse effect. Indeed, it’s Walker’s charismatic persona, as much as Hitchcock’s camera work and cutting, that makes the central plot device work so well: Two strangers meet by accident on a train, have a couple of drinks, talk about their lives; one (a tennis star, played by Farley Granger) is very unhappily married; the other (a spoiled mama’s-boy neurotic) loathes his father and, half-joking (or is he joking at all?), proposes they swap murders–Walker will kill the wife if Granger will kill the father. Since they cannot be linked to each other, there is no motive and the murders can never be solved.
Adapted from Patricia Highsmith’s novel, this opening sequence is among Hitchcock’s most masterfully done: cross-cutting only between two different pairs of shoes, the director follows each from taxi to train station to train, not revealing who they are until, in the lounge car, one’s shoe accidentally bumps the other’s. Then comes the long, complex duologue which, when Hitchcock described it to his first scenarist on the film, Raymond Chandler (legendary creator of detective Philip Marlowe), completely bewildered him. Chandler felt there was simply no way to impart all the nuances Hitchcock wanted: a joking-not joking proposal, totally unaccepted by one, yet believed to be agreed to by the other, none of it spelled out, all by inference. But Chandler was thinking of the printed word while Hitchcock was seeing it on the screen, where choice of angle, size of image, timing of cuts, intonations and personality of actors each play their role in achieving a result. Upon seeing the finished movie, Chandler had to admit Hitchcock had accomplished everything he had described.
Equally remarkable, in more obviously gripping ways, are the murder at a carnival of the rather sluttish wife (an exceptional performance by Laura Elliott)–the actual strangulation seen only as reflected in the lenses of the victim’s fallen eyeglasses–and the final extended fight between Walker and Granger on an out-of-control merry-go-round, kids and parents screaming as the thing whirls wildly. The daunting complexities of shooting this sequence never get in the way of Hitchcock’s flawless manipulation.
Probably the most Hitchcockian aspect of Strangers on a Train, however, is the chilling ambiguity of the situation–the transference of guilt–a theme the director often explored. After all, Walker’s cold-blooded murder–again made possible and believable through the use of the actor’s intrinsic charm in luring the woman to her doom–does actually free Granger from the terrible dilemma he was in, making it possible for him to marry the rich girl he really loves (a nice job by Ruth Roman). Hitchcock keeps this terrible irony clearly present to the end.
While this was just the beginning of an extraordinary decade for the Master of Suspense, the picture would be the last one Robert Walker completed before his tragic death from a heart attack at age 33, the same year as its release. The troubled, gifted actor–he had had drinking problems and a mental breakdown–was filming Leo McCarey’s My Son John (1952), and McCarey had to borrow some of Hitchcock’s footage to finish his movie.

					Everybody in the country goes to bed with Johnny Carson—I go to bed with Walter Cronkite," says TV reporter Lesley Stahl about her hours since she was promoted to Washington anchor of the CBS Morning News. The new job makes Lesley, 35, the second anchor-woman in the history of the male-dominated CBS News. The first was snippy Washington Post reporter Sally Quinn, who bombed in 1973 after six nerve-frazzling months. Quinn blames her failure in large part on a hostile profile in New York magazine written by journalist Aaron Latham. Ironically, Latham is now Lesley Stahl's husband.
Of course, the Quinn drubbing came before Latham, 34, and now an editor of Esquire, had met Lesley. That happened in August 1973 when Aaron was scrounging for Watergate anecdotes and was advised to contact Stahl, then a CBS rookie covering the story. Lesley was not thrilled at the request. " 'How dare you call me at home? If you want to talk, call me tomorrow at the office,' she barked, and then slammed down the phone," Aaron recalls. Dutifully he obeyed, and they agreed to meet the next afternoon. "I said, my God, I'd better turn on the TV to see what this person looks like," he remembers. He did and "was terrified. I thought, 'She's so beautiful.' My heart stopped, my mouth dried up and I said, 'What have I got myself into?' " Meanwhile Lesley had checked out Latham's credentials and to his surprise suggested dinner. "I found out I didn't have to worry about whether or not I could talk," he laughs, "because I never got the chance." "Oooh, cruel," Lesley moans.
Latham soon became New York's Watergate reporter, and for over a year the two of them dined together and talked shop whenever he came to Washington. Their private lives, however, never meshed. Aaron had a live-in lady in New York and Lesley dated many men, including Bob Woodward and then recently divorced Sen. Robert Dole, Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1976. "The most personal thing we said to each other that year was, 'Do you think Nixon will resign?' " reveals Latham. When Nixon quit, "We didn't have anything else to talk about," Lesley remembers. "Suddenly we started seeing something different from what we had been seeing—almost like the old story of the boss who marries his secretary after 35 years."
Gradually Aaron moved his things into her Watergate apartment, and last Christmas Lesley became pregnant. She decided to have the baby, and in February they had a low-key wedding. "I wouldn't have a child without being married," says Lesley. She stayed on the job up to the day before she gave birth in September to a daughter, Taylor, and returned to work after six weeks. During her pregnancy, "They weren't easy on me," she says of CBS. "I had the Korean scandal, which meant stakeouts on my feet." Lesley credits her mother with having talked her into having the baby—"She said it would be a big mistake not to experience a child. Now I agree."
Stahl grew up in Swampscott, Mass. with a younger brother. Their father is a wealthy Jewish food company executive, their mother an unproduced screenwriter. After graduating from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., Lesley went on to graduate studies in zoology at Columbia to become a doctor. Instead she ended up marrying one. After three years they divorced, and she focused on her career. First she worked as a researcher on Mayor John Lindsay's speech-writing staff (she got her job through the New York Times). In 1967 she joined the NBC election unit as a researcher. Finally she became a producer and reporter at Boston's WHDH-TV. When the station changed management she was picked up by CBS, moved to Washington and assigned to the Watergate break-in at its beginning. Stahl soon was known as a fierce competitor. "Lesley had the reputation," reveals a friend, "of scratching your eyes out to get to a phone booth and get her story in first."
Latham, born in the tiny town of Spur, is from a long line of west Texas Methodists. His father ("who looks like a cactus," cracks a writer friend) was a high school football coach, and his mother taught grammar school. At 15 Aaron had ambitions of being a football star until he lost a kidney severely bruised in practice. A bright student, he was recruited by Amherst, became editor of its newspaper and graduated in 1966.
He went to Princeton for his Ph.D., where his dissertation was published as Crazy Sundays: F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood. The next four years he worked at the Washington Post (where one of his friends was Sally Quinn) as the in-house radical reporter covering the peace movement. "Friends leading the marches thought I was a total sellout for working for an Establishment newspaper," he says. "Most have since called me to see if I know where they can get a job." Later, while at New York, he wrote his first novel, Orchids for Mother, a roman à clef about the CIA and the early stages of his relationship with Lesley.
Home for the Lathams is a $180,000 penthouse condominium near Georgetown, overlooking Glover Park. A nurse cares for Taylor, since Lesley gets up at 3 a.m. and reaches the studio by 4. After skimming the papers and consulting with the producer, she writes her script, makes up (she's neither coiffed nor clothed by the network) and is on the air at 7. Besides Stahl, CBS is substituting another new face, reporter Richard Threlkeld, 39, for longtime New York Morning News anchor Hughes Rudd, 56. Rudd will continue to appear on the show with a daily essay.
Aaron spends five days a month at Esquire in New York, the rest back home working on his second novel and reading Trollope and Homer. Despite Lesley's $60,000-or-so salary, there's no professional jealousy—over money, at least. Celebrity recognition could have been another matter, however. After Lesley co-anchored the 1974 elections, she walked down Fifth Avenue with Aaron, expecting people to notice her. No one did. The farther they walked the cheerier Aaron got. "If anyone had recognized me," she now laughs, "I would have asked for their autograph!"
The Lathams' friends are a journalistic crowd, including CBS correspondent Fred Graham and his wife, Lucille, Gail Sheehy (Passages) and Esquire publisher Clay Felker, Bob Woodward and Francie Barnard, Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, and Richard Reeves. Obviously Sally Quinn is no longer a friend and though she admires Lesley, she won't forgive Aaron for his article ("It was the most hurtful thing he has ever done, because he was a friend"). Latham is remorseful, but insists he "didn't say she slept her way to the top—as everyone implies."
For the most part, the tailored, self-assured Stahl is the perfect foil for Latham, who still looks like a rumpled campus radical. "East meets West," says Latham of their differences, gesturing toward the sketch over their bed—Mickey Mouse in flagrante delicto with Marilyn Monroe.

 One of America's most recognized and experienced broadcast journalists, Lesley Stahl's career has been marked by political scoops, surprising features and award-wining foreign reporting.  She has been a 60 Minutes correspondent since March 1991; the 2013-14 season marks her 23rd on the broadcast.  
Stahl recently had the first interview with a hiding member of "Pussy Riot," an all-female punk band whose other members were imprisoned for the band's protest of  Russian leader Vladimir Putin.  She also investigated business practices that are responsible for the high price of eyewear and reported on the Chinese real estate bubble, the biggest in history.   
That same year, her whistleblower interview with F-22 Raptor pilots provided the first public personal accounts of the fighter's oxygen system troubles, spurring the Secretary of Defense to take action. Stahl's interview of a former CIA Clandestine Services chief about the use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" on al Qaeda operatives sparked a national debate.  
Stahl's two reports from the Middle East in the fall of 2010, "Unfinished Business," about Iraq, and "City of David," about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, were honored by the Overseas Press Club for Best Interpretation on International Affairs. Her reporting on the life of a young, musical savant won her an Edward R. Murrow award for feature reporting for her 2008 follow-up on Rex-Lewis Clack.Her interviews with the families of the Duke Lacrosse players exonerated in a racial rape case and with Nancy Pelosi before she became the first woman to become speaker of the house were big scoops for 60 Minutes and CBS News in 2007. Her other exclusive 60 Minutes interviews with former Bush administration officials Paul O'Neill and Richard Clarke ranked among the biggest news stories of 2004. In a December 2002 interview with Al Gore, Stahl was the first to report that he would not run for president.
Prior to joining 60 Minutes, Stahl served as CBS News White House correspondent during the Carter and Reagan presidencies and part of the term of George H. W. Bush.  Her reports appeared frequently on the CBS Evening News, first with Walter Cronkite, then with Dan Rather, and on other CBS News broadcasts. 
During much of that time, she also served as moderator of Face the Nation, CBS News' Sunday public-affairs broadcast (September 1983-May 1991). For Face the Nation, she interviewed such newsmakers as Margaret Thatcher, Boris Yeltsin, Yasir Arafat and virtually every top U.S. official, including George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. 
She was co-host with Charles Kuralt of "America Tonight," a daily CBS News late-night broadcast of interviews and essays (Oct. 90-March 91). 
Her experiences covering Washington for more than 20 years became the subject of her book Reporting Live (Simon & Schuster, 1999).  The stories she has covered since joining CBS News in the Washington bureau in 1972 range from Watergate through the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan to the 1991 Gulf War.  She has reported on U.S.-Russian summit meetings and the economic summits of the industrialized countries, and the national political conventions and election nights throughout her career. 
Stahl anchored several CBS News documentaries, including "The Politics of Cancer" and "In the Red Blues," about the budget deficit, both for "CBS Reports."
Other Emmy winners include a Lifetime Achievement Emmy received in September 2003 and her first Emmy, won for reporting on a bombing in Beirut for the CBS Evening News in 1983. Her Face the Nation interview with Sen. John Tower won Stahl her second statuette.  Her 60 Minutes reports "How He Won the War," about former FDA Commissioner David Kessler's battle with the tobacco industry, and "Punishing Saddam," which exposed the plight of Iraqi citizens, mostly children, suffering the effects of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq, were both Emmy winners.  "Punishing Saddam" also won Stahl electronic journalism's highest honor, an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton.  Her profile of search engine giant Google earned her a 2005 Business and Financial Emmy award, and her timely 2006 interview of ex-Hewlett-Packard Chairwoman Patricia Dunn won an Emmy for coverage of a breaking news story.
In 1996, Stahl was awarded the Fred Friendly First Amendment Award, given by Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn., in recognition of her journalistic achievements.  She was also honored that year by the Radio/Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) with an Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall Excellence in Television for her 60 Minutes report on the Michigan Militia.  In 1990, she was honored with the Dennis Kauff Journalism Award for lifetime achievement in the news profession.
Stahl was born Dec. 16, 1941, in Swampscott, Mass., and was graduated cum laude in 1963 from Wheaton College, where she served on the board of trustees. She currently serves on the board of the New York City Ballet.  She and her husband, author Aaron Latham, live in New York.  They have a daughter, Taylor.

Lesley Stahl was one of the finest reporters ever on the Washington scene during her years as the CBS White House correspondent during the Carter, Reagan and Bush #1 years. She moderated the Sunday newsmaker “Face the Nation” during that period, interviewing world leaders and top officials. Her memoir, Reporting Live, covers these 20 years, including the Watergate scandal.
Lesley has now been with “60 Minutes,” at the top of her game, and the show’s, for 17 seasons. She reported on buying a baby on the Roumanian black market, covered autism to anthrax, inspected Google and Cirque de Soleil. She interviewed Yassir Arafat, Tony Blair, Ahmed Chalabi, Ariel Sharon and the young men from the Duke rape case.
She is wed to the writer Aaron (“Urban Cowboy”) Latham and their pride is daughter, Taylor, who married in the summer of 2007. The soft-spoken bearded Aaron and the dynamic blonde spiky-haired energetic Lesley make quite a couple.
My new mattress! Which is what I asked for for my last birthday. “A mattress? Really?” — was my husband’s reaction. “Well, you asked …” He got me the mattress they have at Westin Hotels. I swear I’m sleeping better.
I miss Bobby Short. The old Eddie Bauer. And  Clinique’s Ginger Snap. Have you noticed that whenever you find a lipstick color that you really love, they stop making it.
Mostly, though, I miss the watch my mother gave me and my father’s cufflinks, both of which were stolen when our apartment was burglarized.
I read the profile of George Clooney by Ian Parker in “The New Yorker” yesterday, and actually underlined a few choice descriptions. “[His] air of pre-therapeutic times … [He was] feeling pretty good about his hair …” And the overall sense of “courteous roguishness.” I have met Clooney; Parker nailed him.
Never thought I’d be the sensible-shoe type, but — alas, while I’ve always worn almost exclusively tall, open toe sling backs (Bruno Magli), I’ve lately been buying flats. Not sexy, but at least I can walk!
Don’t touch red meat (hate it), love veggies but I’m a loon about everything else.  I never eat fruit (once bit into a peach and found half a worm), so instead of berries, I order ice cream; instead of orange juice, I order wine.  Oh wait! Aren’t grapes fruit?  I have to rethink this.

One of my heroes is the person who invented TIVO. TIVO makes one of my great daily pleasures possible: watching Jon Stewart every night, and now the Yankees (this is how Aaron and I keep our relationship alive!), and John Adams on HBO.
I haven’t been to the movies in a while, partly because there hasn’t been anything I’ve wanted to see. But now I hear The Visitor is excellent. Since it’s directed by the man who directed The Station Agent, I’m going to do everything I can to see it this weekend. Same for South Pacific at Lincoln Center.
