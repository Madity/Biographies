      For her 2011 music video "Love You Like A Love Song", Gomez had horses spray-painted pink. This led to accusations from PETA and singer Pink about the treatment of the animals.
      Hospitalized with nausea and terrible headaches after appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992). She was later diagnosed with physical exhaustion and food poisoning [June 13, 2011].

      (December 27, 2013) Battling with lupus for a couple of years now and she became worse recently and this the real reason why she canceled her Australian tour earlier this month.
      I was never the girl who thought I need to make sure I look like all the other girls. I think you look best when you stand out.
      [on Having Her Own Band] I'm going to be in a band - no Selena Gomez stuff. I'm not going to be a solo artist. I think that I don't want my name attached to it. I basically want to make music that is fun and that parents and kids can jump around to and have a good time to.
      I wanted to be like my friends. I hung out with girls who had blue eyes and blond hair and I thought, 'I want to look like them!'
      [on declaring she will remain a virgin until marriage] I said, 'Dad, I want a promise ring.' He went to the church and got it blessed. He actually used me as an example for other kids. I'm going to keep my promise to myself, to my family and to God.
      [on wearing a purity ring] I've had my ring since I was 12 years old. But for me it's not something I want to go around saying, 'Hey, look what I have.' It's a promise I made to myself and God. I think some people misinterpret that as a trend and think everyone's getting one.
      [on reports that she and friend, Demi Lovato had a feud] You can't care (about reports like that), It's really toxic what they do to the girls in the industry.
      [on Lindsay Lohan and her time in rehab] I don't think anybody should be mean because you never understand what's someone is going through. And it is partly (this) business, because it is crazy and hectic. So I think that nobody should be rude. If this were a normal person, you wouldn't be so judgmental. I feel like people shouldn't judge as much, they should give their sympathy.
      [on revealing she would prefer to date someone who is not famous] You kind of can't help who you'll fall in love with. I'd date someone who isn't in the business in a heartbeat.
      Everyone wants songs written by Katy Perry. I asked her and she was so nice - she just said, 'Yeah, you can have it.' She was very kind.
      For me, the person that I really admire because they came from this Disney world would be Shia LaBeouf. He had his own show on Disney Channel. He was really funny and I loved his show. Then he started to do films. Now he is doing really great films and he is respected as an actor. I really like him a lot as an actor. I think he is cute, too, so that helps. I feel that I can relate to him the most.
      I'm going to be Katy Perry for Halloween. I'm going to have the blue hair and the ice cream outfit she did. It's going to be awesome.
      [on working with Katy Perry] It is so much fun. It's very soulful and it's kind of got her flair mixed in with my dance kind-of-a-little techno vibe. So it was really amazing and I really loved it. I was extremely honored, cause I'm a huge fan of hers.
      [on Justin Bieber] I love Justin. When he first started to come over from Canada his manager contacted me and he just said that he would like to meet me and he was just such a good kid.
      [on Demi Lovato] I love her. I completely love her and her whole family to death. I will always talk extremely highly of her and I always have.
      (on going to her firs concert - a Britney Spears show) We were in the nosebleeds with my cousin. I got the T-shirt and glow sticks and I just remember it being the highlight of my life! I felt like I was on cloud nine!
      (on doing a Britney Spears tribute for her concert) We are working on a Britney tribute, which I'm so stoked about, 'cause I love Britney. I was like, 'I have to do it.' I wanna do a mash-up of all her songs and just go for it. We're gonna do a little tribute. We're gonna do her hits, ' ... Baby One More Time,' and then I think we're going to try to incorporate 'Toxic' and that phase. And then we might do some of her recent, new stuff.
      (on performing songs from Britney Spears during a tribute concert) I'm not going to even touch Britney! She's so good. I wouldn't want to butcher it. I'm just going to pay tribute to her! I'm gonna say she's awesome.
      (On Rebecca Black's song "Friday") I love it! Total guilty pleasure! I totally admire her, I think it's awesome that she hasn't taken that downward spiral that other child stars have taken.
      [on her boyfriend, Justin Bieber] Yeah, he is romantic. He gave me a bottle of his new perfume the other day. (2011)

I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]."[15] On June 12, 2013, Mandy and her second husband Brian Teefey had a daughter named Gracie Elliot Teefey.[16][17]

So it's pretty incredible."[146][147] Gomez said of her role as ambassador that: "Every day 25,000 children die from preventable causes. I stand with UNICEF in the belief that we can change that number from 25,000 to zero. I know we can achieve this because every moment, UNICEF is on the ground providing children with the lifesaving assistance needed to ensure zero becomes a reality."[145]
Gomez was named spokesperson for UNICEF's 2009 Trick-or-Treat campaign, for the second year in a row.[148] Gomez, who raised over $700,000 for the charity in 2008, stated that she hopes to be able to raise 1 million dollars in 2009.[146] Gomez participated in a celebrity auction[149] and hosted a live web cast series on Facebook in support of the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign.[150] Gomez returned as the UNICEF spokesperson for the 60th anniversary of Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign in 2010.[151] In celebration of the 60th anniversary, Gomez and her band, The Scene, held a benefit concert donating all proceeds to the campaign.[152] In February 2011, Gomez traveled to Chile to witness and meet with the families of UNICEF's supported program, "Programa Puente" which helps families better understand and develops skills to deal effectively with early childhood education, development and other issues related to raising children. From her field trip experience, Gomez said "UNICEF is helping Chilean families get out of poverty, prevent violence within the home and promote education. To witness first hand these families' struggles, and also their hope and perseverance, was truly inspiring."[153] In March 2011, Gomez participated in the UNICEF Tap Project's "Celebrity Tap Pack" limited-edition, custom-made water bottles featuring tap water from the homes of each celebrity advocate, in order to raise funds and increase profile for the clean water and sanitation programs.[154] She is also featured in videos promoting the campaign.[155][156]

        Selena Gomez may have started her career as an actress, starring in a Disney Channel series at the age of 15, but she soon showed that her musical talents were perhaps even stronger as she piled up hit singles and chart-topping albums. Born in 1992, she grew up in Texas and got her first break as a cast member on the kids' TV show Barney and Friends. Gomez landed minor roles in several other TV programs, but it was her affiliation with the Disney Channel -- who discovered her during a nationwide talent search in 2004 -- that officially jump-started her acting career. Guest appearances on The Suite Life of Zach and Cody and Hannah Montana paved the way for Gomez's own show, The Wizards of Waverly Place, which premiered in October 2007 and quickly became one of the network's most popular programs. Dubbed "the next Miley Cyrus," Gomez began juggling her commitment to The Wizards of Waverly Place with additional projects, including movie roles and a burgeoning singing career.  Gomez began branching out into pop music by recording songs for her own Disney projects. She sang the theme song for The Wizards of Waverly Place, recorded several other tunes for the the show's soundtrack, and performed on the soundtrack of the family film Another Cinderella Story. By 2009, she'd also assembled her own teen pop band, Selena Gomez & the Scene, and signed a contract with Hollywood Records. The band's full-length debut, Kiss & Tell, was released that year and went gold, as did its 2010 follow-up, A Year Without Rain. Gomez continued filming The Wizards of Waverly Place and made her theatrical debut in the 2010 film adaptation of Ramona and Beezus, but her music garnered just as much attention, as did a highly publicized relationship with fellow teen idol Justin Bieber.  When Wizards of Waverly Place started airing its final season in November 2010, Gomez shifted her attention back to her band, whose third album, When the Sun Goes Down, was recorded in early 2011 and released later that year. She then took a break from music to focus more on acting, with her first role in a decidedly adult movie in 2013's Spring Breakers showing she could stretch beyond teen stardom. Her return to music in 2013 with her fourth album -- but the first credited to her as a solo artist -- also showed some stretching as she added dubstep, R&B, and EDM to her sound. Stars Dance was released in July of 2013. ~ Matt Collar & Andrew Leahey, Rovi

I dont think this is actually you Selena, its a group of people pretending, I hope it is you but im pretty sure its not
I heard you found a new management that’s great but will the music you put out still be appropriate for selenators to listen to especially the little girls who are six That look up to you? @selena merie
Please dont tell me the music videos and music you put out will have faul language in it like miley Cyrus we can’t stop I hope it won’t and I hope this management leads you in the right path in your career like your parents did.
Omg sel I love ur New single just in love it’s amazing and appropriate good job. So is justin good enough for you?  Better than miley Cyrus we can’t stop!!!!!! Baby LISTEN please I’m not on drugs I’m not on drugs I’m just in love your good enough for me your high enough for me. Love it!!!!! Selenators: in this song for those of you who don’t know, selena is not talking about getting “high” like miley Cyrus she would never do that type  of thing. Selena is just talking about a boy that she’s so in love with that she can’t get enough of. Where miley Cyrus is talking about actually  doing the Molly in the restroom. Which is INNOPROPRATE and going to the club stripping. This song is differerent. Trust me selena is not miley Cyrus they are two different people. Selena is a good role model for younger girls and teens while miley Cyrus isn’t.
Selenator: in the song when selena says “your high enough for me” understand she’s not talking about being “high” on drugs she’s saying justin love is all she needs because love is like cloud 9. Selena is saying to justin that his love is high up in the clouds  so she’s trying to get to it. Listen to the lyrics u will understand.
