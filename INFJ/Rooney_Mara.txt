 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Rooney Mara was born in Bedford, New York in 1985. Christened Patricia Rooney Mara when she made her debut on the world stage, she is one of four children of NFL football team New York Giants executive Timothy Christopher Mara and Kathleen McNulty, the granddaughter of Art Rooney, Sr., the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers football franchise (Her mother's maiden name is Rooney).Her grandfathers were Wellington Mara, co-owner of the Giants, and Tim Rooney, owner of Yonkers Raceway, and her great-uncle is Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, the former Ambassador to Ireland. Her father has Irish, German, and French-Canadian ancestry, and her mother is of Irish and Italian descent.After graduating from Bedford's Fox Lane High school, she enrolled in the Traveling School, which took her to South America to study. She spent a year at George Washington University before transferring to New York University, where she studied international social policy and psychology. She took her degree from NYU in 2010. Her studies focused on non-profit organizations, as her family has a tradition of involvement in philanthropic causes.She had thought of acting after watching old movies and attending musical theater, but did not think of it as a serious vocation and was afraid she might fail at it. As a result of her reservations, she appeared in only one play while in high school.She began seriously focusing on acting when she was at New York University, appearing in student films. Inspired by her older sister, actress Kate Mara, she began to pursue the craft, auditioning for acting jobs at the age of 19. She appeared with her sister Kate in the video horror movie Urban Legends: Bloody Mary (2005), billing herself as "Patricia Mara". As "Tricia Mara", she had guest roles on TV and won her first lead in the movie Tanner Hall (2009), which was shot in the fall of 2007.She originally auditioned for the supporting role of Lucasta in "Tanner Hall", a $3-million independent film, but director Tatiana von Furstenberg was so impressed by the young actress, she had her return to audition for the lead role of Fernanda, which Mara won. Furstenberg was delighted with her nuanced performance, saying, "Still waters run deep".Continuing to call herself Tricia Mara, it was during the making of "Tanner Hall" that she considered changing her professional name to Rooney Mara, soliciting the advice of the cast and crew. After premiering at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, her performance in "Tanner Hall" brought the rechristened Rooney Mara a "Rising Star" award at the 2009 Hamptons Film Festival and a "Stargazer Award" at the 2010 Gen Art Film Festival.In 2010 she got her first lead role in a major feature, in the $35 million remake A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010). The movie proved disappointing at the box office, grossing only $63 million domestically and racking up a world-wide gross of just under $116 million. However, that same year, she was noticed by critics in the small but pivotal role of the Boston University undergrad Erica who dumps Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network (2010). Director David Fincher subsequently cast her as the lead in his The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) trilogy.In the spirit of her family's philanthropic endeavors, Rooney created Faces of Kibera, a charity that provides food, medical care and housing to orphans in Nairobi, Kenya's Kibra district, a small slum that houses a million people. There are many orphans as AIDS is rampant in the slum.
      Considers Gena Rowlands to be her favorite actress and A Woman Under the Influence (1974) to be her favorite film.
      Great-grandfather Tim Mara founded the New York Giants. Great-grandfather Art Rooney founded the Pittsburgh Steelers.
      Daughter of Timothy Christopher Mara, a scout for the New York Giants and Kathleen McNulty, née Rooney.
      Rooney Mara founded the non-profit organization Faces of Kibera. It provides housing, food, and medical care for orphans in Kibera, a slum in Nairobi, Kenya. The charity's goal is to build an orphanage in the region, for which 6 acres of land have been purchased. The charity auctions memorabilia from the Steelers and Giants, as well as training camp events on eBay to raise money.
      Rooney and her sister Kate Mara both appeared in Best Picture Oscar nominated films in 2011. Rooney was in The Social Network (2010), Kate in 127 Hours (2010).
      Several sources, including Vogue and Entertainment Weekly, reported that the piercings (including multiple ear, eyebrow, and nipple piercings) that Rooney Mara sports, as "Lisbeth Salander", in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) were real, not cosmetic simulations. Mara got the piercings in a series of sessions in Brooklyn and Sweden.
      Turned down the role of Estella in Great Expectations (2012). Holliday Grainger was eventually cast.
      Her paternal grandfather was of Irish descent and her paternal grandmother was of half German, as well as of French-Canadian and Irish, ancestry. Her mother is of Irish and Italian descent.
      [on the poster for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)] There's a certain way people are used to seeing nude women, and that's in a submissive, coy pose, not looking at the camera. And in this poster, I'm looking dead into the camera with no expression on my face. I think it freaks a lot of people out.
      [on portraying Lisbeth Salander] I spent over a year with the character and there are so many different things that I love about her. I think the thing that makes her such a compelling character is that you do sort of fall instantly in love with her, but at the same time you don't always agree with what she's doing and you also question her and you get frustrated by her. She's just an incredibly multi-layered character.
      [on her The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) character] She's unlike any character I've read before, and I think there's a reason the whole world has fallen in love with her. It's hard not to. I felt like I really understood her. I went in for Erica Albright never thinking I'd get it because I couldn't really relate to her. Playing that character was actually much more foreign to me than playing Salander, but they loved me, which was a shock.
      [on Lisbeth Salander] There aren't many interesting and diverse parts out there for women. There seem to be a few different stereotypical roles that get recycled, so it was refreshing to have this complex character for a woman; very rare.
      My favorite thing about acting isn't necessarily the acting part. It's that you never stop learning, you're constantly learning new skills and new things about people. To me that's really interesting and fun.
      When I was at college, my nickname was Keds, because I wore Keds. I guess it wasn't really a nickname, because nicknames are usually given to you by people who are your friends and who know you. But I didn't know the people who called me Keds. I think that they didn't like me because I didn't want to join a sorority. I left that school.
      [on her The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) character] It's certainly hard to sort of embody such a dark place for that amount of time. I felt as though it was much harder to come out of it than it was to go into it. Going into it was really easy for me.
      I don't know if it's so much a movie that has a lot of money versus a movie that has no money. I think every film you do has its differences. It's about the combination of people that you're with.
      I don't think the human body is something to be ashamed of. Every other person on the planet has the same parts as I do. So seeing them shouldn't be a huge shock to most people.
      Sometimes you read a review to see if anyone else picked up on something bad that you already picked up on yourself... In fact, rarely do you believe it when someone says something nice.
      I think that I have a pretty vivid imagination despite my stable household. Everyone's family has their quirks. No one is perfect.
      My sister was really upset when my mom brought her home a training bra. She didn't want it, so I moseyed on over and picked it up. I was very eager to get boobs.
      You kind of forget that it's me on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011). It doesn't look like me. It doesn't walk like me or talk like me. And so I think it was easier for my family to get lost in it than maybe any other part.

Patricia Rooney Mara (born April 17, 1985)[1] is an American actress who made her acting debut in 2005 and has gone on to star in films including A Nightmare on Elm Street, the remake of the 1984 horror film, and The Social Network. She rose to prominence starring as Lisbeth Salander, the title character in the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, based on Stieg Larsson's Millennium book series. For her performance in the film, she received critical acclaim and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. In 2013, she starred in the thriller Side Effects, the independent drama Ain't Them Bodies Saints, and the acclaimed science fiction romance Her.
Mara is also known for her charity work and oversees the charity Uweza Foundation, which supports empowerment programs for children and families in the Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, one of the largest slums in Africa.
Mara was born and raised in Bedford, New York, a town in Westchester County, north of New York City.[2] Mara's mother's family founded the Pittsburgh Steelers and her father's family founded the New York Giants.[3] Her father, Timothy Christopher Mara, is the vice president of player evaluation for the New York Giants, and her mother, Kathleen McNulty (née Rooney), a part-time real estate agent.[4] She has an older brother, Daniel, an older sister who is also an actress, Kate, and a younger brother, Conor.[5]
Mara's father has Irish, German, and French-Canadian ancestry, and her mother is of Irish and Italian descent.[6][7][8] Her Rooney ancestors originated in Newry, County Down.[9] Her paternal grandfather, Wellington Mara, the long-time co-owner of the Giants, was succeeded in that position by her uncle, John Mara. Her maternal grandfather, Timothy James "Tim" Rooney, has run Yonkers Raceway in Yonkers, New York since 1972.[10][11] Mara is the great-granddaughter of both New York Giants founder Tim Mara and Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney, Sr., as well as of Kathleen McNulty Rooney.[12] Her great-uncle, Dan Rooney, is chairman of the Steelers, the United States Ambassador to Ireland, and the co-founder of The Ireland Funds charitable organization. U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney from Florida is her first cousin, once removed.[13]
After graduating from Fox Lane High School in 2003,[14] she went to Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia in South America for four months as part of the Traveling School, an open learning environment. She attended George Washington University for a year, and then transferred to New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where she studied psychology, international social policy, and nonprofits,[5][15] graduating in 2010.[16]
Mara was inspired to act by seeing musical theatre and classic movies, like Gone with the Wind (1939), Rebecca (1940), and Bringing Up Baby (1938), with her mother.[17] She also wanted to be like her sister, Kate Mara, a professional actress. Patricia resisted pursuing acting as a child, stating to The Journal News that "it never seemed that honorable to me, and I guess I was always afraid that I might fail."[2] Her first and only role in high school was Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, which she got after being signed up to audition by a friend.[18] Mara acted in a few student films while at NYU, and then began her career in acting,[2] first auditioning at the age of nineteen.[5]
Mara first appeared as an extra in films which starred her sister, including a bit-part in the 2005 direct-to-video horror film Urban Legends: Bloody Mary. She found work in television, making her professional debut in a 2006 episode of the drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, as a girl who bullies overweight children.[19] She guest-starred on the legal drama Women's Murder Club in 2007 and played a drug addict in an episode of The Cleaner in 2008.[20] Mara made her feature film debut Dream Boy in 2008 and guest-starred as Megan for two episodes of NBC's ER in 2009.
In a coming-of-age film Tanner Hall, Mara landed her first lead role, playing Fernanda who has an affair with a married family friend (Tom Everett Scott).[21] The film was the debut of filmmakers Tatiana von Fürstenberg and Francesca Gregorini.[22] It debuted at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release in September 2011.[23] Mara dropped her first name, Patricia to be known professionally by her middle name after working on the project. "I never really liked my first name," Mara stated to Paper magazine. "I never felt like a Tricia. And Rooney is more memorable".[24] Her father and younger brother also go by their middle names.[25]
In Miguel Arteta's 2009 comedy-drama film Youth in Revolt, Mara played Taggarty who tries to sleep with 50 men before she goes to college. The film was based on C.D. Payne's 1993 cult novel of the same name.[26][27] Mara had auditioned for the starring role, but was offered the smaller part when the lead went to Portia Doubleday.[28]
Mara played Courtney in the 2009 independent film, Dare[29] and in The Winning Season as Wendy, a high school basketball player who has an affair with a middle-aged shoe salesman (Kevin Breznahan) with a similar story to The Bad News Bears.[30][31] Both films were premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and Mara was included on Filmmaker magazine's list of "25 New Faces of Independent Film" that year.[17]
Mara starred in a remake of the 1984 horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street,[32] as the protagonist Nancy Holbrook, a high school student victimized by Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley).[33] Mara began shooting the film in Chicago on May 5, 2009, directed by Samuel Bayer.[34] Mara told Filmmaker that she felt that her Nancy was "completely different from the original" and "the loneliest girl in the world".[17] Mara had signed on to continue her role if a sequel was made.[35] She stated to Vogue that she disliked the experience of making the film so much, that it made her question if she wanted to be an actress.[5] Mara appeared at the Hamptons International Film Festival in October 2009 as part of its Breakthrough Performers Program, where she was tutored by Sharon Stone.[36]
In David Fincher's biopic drama film The Social Network, she played Erica Albright who breaks up with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook who created the social networking website.[24][37]
In August 2010, Mara was cast as the lead in a film adaptation of the Millennium book trilogy by Stieg Larsson. She played Lisbeth Salander, a damaged punk computer hacker who helps journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) attempt to solve a series of murders.[38] Mara won the role over several other actresses after two and a half months of auditions and screen tests.[39][40] David Fincher directed the first film, based on the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, with Scott Rudin producing. The other books, The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest, may be adapted, depending on box office performance.[41][42] Fincher initially did not picture her as the character but changed his mind when she auditioned.[43] He convinced executives at Columbia Pictures to cast her for the part.[44]
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo began shooting in Sweden in September 2010.[45] Mara did not consider the film to be a remake, but another interpretation of the novel. "I plan on giving my interpretation of the character," she stated to Variety.[46] Mara's long brown hair was cut short and dyed black, in a style reminiscent of 1970s punk and 1980s goth fashions. She also had each of her ears pierced four times, and had her brow and right nipple pierced for the role. Her nose and lip piercings were fake. She kept the nipple piercing so that it would not need to be re-pierced for a sequel.[1] Mara's eyebrows were bleached, and she wore a temporary dragon tattoo.[40][47] She began preparing for the role by starting to skateboard and kickbox, and underwent dialect and computer training. She also visited Stockholm, the setting of the novel.[48] The film was released on December 20, 2011.[49] Mara received universal critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance.[50] On January 24, 2012, Mara was nominated for her first Academy Award nomination in the category of Best Actress for this role.[51]
In late 2011, it was revealed that Mara had joined the cast of Terrence Malick's untitled and latest film, with Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Natalie Portman, Cate Blanchett and Val Kilmer.[52] Listed as a musical drama that's scheduled to be released sometime in 2013, the plot line of the movie has largely been kept under wraps thus far. An official logline released by FilmNation in February 2012[53] described Malick's picture as a story of "two intersecting love triangles" and, "sexual obsession and betrayal set against the music scene in Austin, Texas."
In early 2012, Mara dropped out of Kathryn Bigelow's action film Zero Dark Thirty due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced by Jessica Chastain.[54] Mara replaced Carey Mulligan in Spike Jonze's film, Her (2013). Variety reported that Mulligan had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, and Mara was selected to fill in alongside Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and Scarlett Johansson.[55][56]
Mara starred in Steven Soderbergh's 2013 crime/thriller film Side Effects, with Jude Law, Channing Tatum, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Vinessa Shaw. As the lead character, Emily Taylor, she played "a woman who turns to prescription medication as a way of handling her anxiety concerning her husband's upcoming release from prison."[57]
She starred in David Lowery's 2013 independent film Ain't Them Bodies Saints which is described as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde story, alongside Casey Affleck and Ben Foster.[56] The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013 and the rights for U.S. distribution were bought by IFC Films.[58] In May 2013, she became the new face of Calvin Klein new fragrance Down Town.[59]
In March 2014, Mara was cast as Tiger Lily in the upcoming Joe Wright-directed film adaptation of Pan, a role for which Lupita Nyong'o and Adèle Exarchopoulos were also considered.[60]
Mara founded the charity Faces of Kibera, which aimed to provide housing, food, and medical care for orphans in Kibera, a Nairobi, Kenya slum. The charity's goal was to build an orphanage in the region, for which 6 acres of land have been purchased.[2] The charity auctioned memorabilia from the Steelers and Giants, as well as training camp events on eBay to raise money.[12]
Mara visited the area as a volunteer in 2006 and was moved to help the orphans, many whose parents have died from AIDS and HIV-related illnesses. She began the charity due to her frustration with the growing number of nonprofits that are just business opportunities. "The people who need help aren’t really getting it. So I started my own", she told Interview magazine in 2009.[26] Mara was not really working yet when she started the charity, so later found it challenging to balance her charity work and acting career. "I need to do both; I can't just do acting,“ she stated to The Journal News.[2]
In January 2011, Faces of Kibera merged with Uweza Foundation which runs community-based empowerment programs in Kibera, including soccer leagues and after-school tutoring. Uweza is a Swahili word meaning opportunity, ability, and power.[61] Mara serves as the president of the board of directors for the foundation.[62]
Mara moved to Los Angeles in early 2007 and lived with her sister temporarily.[63][64] Although they do not live together anymore, Mara felt that the experience brought them closer together, and they still regularly discuss the film business and movie scripts.[2] As of January 2012, Mara lived in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.[1] She includes Gena Rowlands among the actors who inspire her, especially her performances in A Woman Under the Influence (1974) and Opening Night (1977).[17] She is a vegan.[65][66]
Mara's mother's family founded the Pittsburgh Steelers, and her father's family founded the New York Giants. The families have maintained at least partial ownership of both teams since their foundings. Mara's father and paternal uncles have high ranking positions within the Giants organization; her uncle John Mara is the president and CEO of the team. Mara has described football as "the glue that holds our family together."[67]

"I always wanted to be an actor, but I was always fighting it. It never seemed that honorable to me, and I guess I was always afraid that I might fail." - Mara Rooney
                In one of the most hotly contested casting races in recent memory, the relatively unknown actress Rooney Mara toppled Hollywood heavyweights Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson (among others) to land the coveted role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher’s eagerly anticipated adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s literary phenomenon, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She's already an up-and-comer, with roles in Youth in Revolt, A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Social Network. But Mara’s casting as the pixie hacker in the new blockbuster -- and its sequels -- has sealed her fate as Hollywood’s newest "it" girl.            
                Unlike the asocial cyberpunk she’s been enlisted to portray in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Rooney Mara’s features are delicate and classic. Let’s face it, the girl has movie-star-in-the-making written all over her. Though her love life has yet to be scrutinized by the gossip-hungry vultures at TMZ and beyond (trust us, we checked), her incoming superstardom should make her and her future lovers staples of celebrity glossies for years to come.            
                It may seem that Rooney Mara was plucked out of obscurity to play the role of a lifetime -- Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo -- but trust us, girl paid her dues. After five years in show business, plying her trade with forgettable roles in shows like Law And Order: Special Victims Unit and ER, Mara finally made her mark with a supporting role in Youth in Revolt and the lead in the A Nightmare on Elm Street reboot.  However, it was her performance in David Fincher’s upcoming Facebook Saga The Social Network that turned her on to the cinematic maestro, and forced him to cast her in his adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s international best-seller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Mara has also signed on to appear in the next two films of Larsson’s Millenium trilogy, so look for the future movie star to be a ubiquitous presence at the multiplex for a very long time.            
                Rooney Mara was born in an affluent Westchester County town, an unlikely princess of football royalty. Her father is an executive with the New York Giants, and her two great grandfathers founded the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants respectively. Mara has actually gone so far as to say that football is the glue that holds her family together, odd words for the elegant actress who grew up traveling through South America and studying psychology, international social policy and nonprofits at New York University. Though she remains passionate about charitable work (Mara oversees the charity Faces of Kibera, which provides aid for orphans in Kenya), her early experiences in musical theater as well as watching her older sister Kate succeed in Hollywood inspired Mara to pursue a career in acting.
Judging by the genesis of Rooney Mara’s acting career, movie stardom was never a certainty for the young ingenue. Her professional acting debut was in the straight-to-DVD stinker Urban Legends: Bloody Mary, which she followed up with ordinary work in television shows like Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and ER. Her first lead in a feature film was in the forgettable Tanner Hall alongside Amy Sedaris and Tom Everett; however, her standout performance and natural screen presence screamed potential, and turned Hollywood on to a bright young talent.
Though audiences were still unfamiliar with Rooney Mara, casting directors began taking notice of the rising star. She auditioned for the lead in the Michael Cera-starring Youth in Revolt, but director Miguel Arteta cast her in a supporting role instead. In the film her character attempts to bed 50 guys before she goes to college, which sounds like a pretty good idea to us. She also appeared in the films Dare and The Winning Season, which led to her being named on Filmmaker magazine’s “25 New Faces of Independent Film” in 2009. But her big break -- or rather the role that led to her big break -- was being cast in David Fincher’s rabidly anticipated The Social Network. The film -- in which she plays Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s ex-girlfriend -- has been receiving white hot buzz since there was barely a script. Clearly, Fincher enjoyed working with Mara, because his next move would change her life forever.
For months, bloggers (and their older, more respected cousins, journalists) speculated as to who would land the immensely coveted role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher’s screen version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Stieg Larsson’s novel and its two sequels had officially become the most significant work of pulp fiction since Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code.  The casting of Lisbeth -- the tatted and pierced hacker and centerpiece of the trilogy -- was crucial. Rooney Mara’s name was bandied about from the start, but got lost in the fray of more famous competitors like Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman and Ellen Page. In the end, David Fincher shocked Hollywood by casting the relatively unknown Mara in one of the most sought-after roles in recent memory. The high-profile job almost guarantees Mara A-list status, at least during her time as Lisbeth. The question now is can she live up to the challenge and hype? Or will she crumble under the white hot lights?
