From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders. Contact the EVE Foundation to have Lee speak at your next event.

Sufjan Stevens (/ˈsuːfjɑːn/ SOOF-yahn; born July 1, 1975) is an American singer-songwriter and musician born in Detroit, Michigan. Stevens first began releasing his music on Asthmatic Kitty, a label co-founded with his stepfather, beginning with the 1999 release, A Sun Came. He is best known for his 2005 album, Illinois, which hit number one in the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, and for the song "Chicago".
Stevens has released albums of varying styles, from the electronica of Enjoy Your Rabbit and the lo-fi folk of Seven Swans to the symphonic instrumentation of Illinois and Christmas-themed Songs for Christmas. Stevens makes use of a variety of instruments, often playing many of them himself on the same recording,[2] and writes music in various time signatures. Though he has repeatedly stated an intent to separate his beliefs from his music,[3][4] Stevens also freely draws from the Bible and other spiritual traditions,[which?] often incorporating mystical elements into his music.
Stevens was born in Detroit and lived there until the age of nine, when his family moved to Petoskey, Michigan. He attended Petoskey High School, the prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy and graduated from Harbor Light Christian School. He went on to attend Hope College in Holland, Michigan and earned a Master of Fine Arts from The New School in New York City.[5]
Sufjan is an Arabic or Persian name[6] meaning "comes with a sword".[7] It predates Islam and most famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a figure from early Islamic history. The name was given to Stevens by the founder of Subud, an inter-faith spiritual community to which his parents belonged when he was born.[8]
A multi-instrumentalist, Stevens is known for his use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums through the use of multitrack recording. While in school, he studied the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums.
Stevens currently lives in Kensington, Brooklyn, in New York City,[9] where he makes up the Brooklyn staff of Asthmatic Kitty Records.[10] His brother Marzuki Stevens is a nationally recognized marathon runner.[11]
Stevens began his musical career as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band from Holland, Michigan. He also played (and continues to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. While in school at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, A Sun Came, which he released on Asthmatic Kitty Records. He later moved to New York City, where he was enrolled in a writing program at the New School for Social Research.
While in New York, Stevens composed and recorded the music for his second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese zodiac that delved into electronica.
Stevens followed this with the first album to be released as a part of his "Fifty States Project", a collection of folk songs and instrumentals inspired by his home state of Michigan. The result, the expansive Michigan included odes to cities including Detroit and Flint, the Upper Peninsula, and vacation areas such as Tahquamenon Falls. Melded into the scenic descriptions and characters are his own declarations of faith, sorrow, love, and the regeneration of Michigan.
Following the release of Michigan, Stevens compiled a collection of songs recorded previously into a side project, the album Seven Swans, which was released in March 2004.
Next he released the second in the 50 states project, titled Illinois. Among the subjects explored on Illinois are the cities of Chicago, Decatur and Jacksonville; the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, the death of a friend on Casimir Pulaski Day, the poet Carl Sandburg, and the serial killer John Wayne Gacy.
Over the 2005 winter holidays, Stevens recorded an album with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas were having a baby together, but were forced to print a retraction.[12][13][14] Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools' prank.[15] In December 2006, the collaborative recordings were digitally released by Nettwerk as a Rosie Thomas album titled These Friends of Mine. The album was released in physical form on March 13, 2007.
On September 11, 2006, in Nashville, Tennessee, Stevens debuted a new composition, a ten-minute-plus piece titled "Majesty Snowbird".[16][17] On November 21, 2006, a five CD box set Songs for Christmas was released, which contains originals and Christmas standards recorded every year since 2001 (except 2004). Stevens undertook in the project initially as an exercise to make himself 'appreciate' Christmas more.[18] The songs were the work of an annual collaboration between Stevens and different collaborators, including minister Vito Aiuto; the songs themselves were distributed to friends and family.
In April 2007, in Brooklyn and Philadelphia, Stevens made unannounced appearances on Thomas's tour in support of this album. In 2007, he did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon standing on a roof in Cincinnati.[19] In 2007, he played shows sporadically, including playing at the Kennedy Center to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Millennium Stage concerts.[20] He was commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music to create a "music and film work" titled The BQE, described as "a symphonic and cinematic exploration of New York City's infamous Brooklyn-Queens Expressway".[21] It premiered at BAM's Next Wave festival on November 1–3, 2007.[22] Stevens has also worked as an essayist, contributing to Asthmatic Kitty Records' "Sidebar" feature and Topic Magazine.[23] He wrote the introduction to the 2007 edition of The Best American Nonrequired Reading, a short story about his early childhood education and learning to read titled How I Trumped Rudolf Steiner and Overcame the Tribulations of Illiteracy, One Snickers Bar at a Time.[24][25] That winter, he hosted an "Xmas Song Exchange Contest" in which winner Alec Duffy won exclusive rights to the original Stevens song "The Lonely Man of Winter." The track has never been uploaded, and can now only be heard by attending private listening parties at Duffy's home in Brooklyn.[26][27]
Stevens has contributed to the music of Denison Witmer, Soul Junk, Half-handed Cloud, Brother Danielson, Danielson Famile, Serena Maneesh, Castanets, Will Stratton, Shannon Stephens, Clare & the Reasons, and Liz Janes. In 2007 alone, Stevens played piano on The National's album Boxer, produced and contributed many instrumental tracks to Rosie Thomas's album These Friends of Mine, multiple instruments on Ben + Vesper's album All This Could Kill You and oboe and vocals to David Garland's 2007 album Noise in You.
He has contributed covers of Tim Buckley ("She Is"), Joni Mitchell ("Free Man in Paris"), Daniel Johnston ("Worried Shoes"), John Fahey ("Variation on 'Commemorative Transfiguration & Communion at Magruder Park"), The Innocence Mission ("The Lakes of Canada"), Bob Dylan ("Ring Them Bells") and The Beatles ("What Goes On") to various tribute albums. His versions of "Free Man in Paris" and "What Goes On" are notable for only retaining the lyrics of the original, as Stevens has taken his own interpretation on the melody and arrangement. His rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner" has a similar rearranged melody and arrangement as well as a whole new verse.[28]
His songs "The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders" and "All the Trees of the Field Will Clap Their Hands" were featured in the 2006 British comedy-drama Driving Lessons, starring Harry Potter's Julie Walters and Rupert Grint. In 2008, he produced Welcome to the Welcome Wagon, the debut album of Brooklyn-based husband and wife duo Vito and Monique Aiuto, The Welcome Wagon.
In February 2009, Stevens contributed "You Are the Blood" to the AIDS benefit album Dark Was the Night produced by the Red Hot Organization. In April 2009, Stevens uploaded a song about director Sofia Coppola online.[29] This song was written while Stevens was in college, from a series of songs about names.
"[...] A few weeks later, our dog got hit by a snowplow and I forgot all about the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) in the same way that Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...]"[30]
In September 2009, Stevens began performing four new songs while on his Fall tour, "All Delighted People", "Impossible Soul", "Too Much" and "Age of Adz".[31] That year Stevens contributed to an album with his step father, Lowell Brams, entitled Music For Insomnia. The album was released December 8, 2009.[32]
In November 2009, Stevens admitted to Exclaim! Magazine, in regard to the fact that he recently called his fifty-state project a joke, that "I don't really have as much faith in my work as I used to, but I think that's healthy. I think it's allowed me to be less precious about how I work and write. And maybe it's okay for us to take it less seriously."[33]
In June 2010, The National's Bryce Dessner claimed Stevens was at work on his next full length album and stated the band was working on the new album.[34]
Beginning with the album Michigan, Stevens announced an intent to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. states. Several years after completing a second state-themed album, Stevens admitted that the project had been a "promotional gimmick" and not one he had seriously intended to complete.[35]
Stevens had spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the second album, Illinois. As with Michigan, Stevens used the state of Illinois as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. Though slated for general release on July 5, 2005, the album was briefly delayed by legal issues regarding the use of Superman in the original album cover artwork. In the double vinyl release, a balloon sticker has been placed over Superman on the cover art of the first 5,000 copies. The next printings had an empty space where the Superman image was, as with the CD release.[36]
The widely acclaimed Illinois was the highest-rated album of 2005 on the Metacritic review aggregator site, based on glowing reviews from Pitchfork Media, The Onion A/V Club, Spin, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, KEXP, and The Guardian.[37] The 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards awarded Stevens with the Album of the Year, Best Album Art/Packaging, and Male Artist of the Year. Pitchfork Media, No Ripcord, and Paste Magazine named Illinois as the editors' choice for best album of 2005 and Stevens received the 2005 Pantheon prize, awarded to noteworthy albums selling fewer than 500,000 copies, for Illinois.[38] In April 2006, Stevens announced that 21 pieces of music he had culled from the Illinois recording sessions would be incorporated into a new album, called The Avalanche,[39] which was released on July 11, 2006.
The introduction of "Come On! Feel The Illinoise!" demonstrates the lush arrangements and various instrumentation used by Stevens in Illinois
Though Stevens' subsequent work was sometimes speculated to tie into future "States" projects,[40][41] and Stevens himself would make occasional statements alluding to the future of the project,[42] The Guardian published an interview with Stevens in 2009 in which he stated in relation to the Fifty States Project: "I have no qualms about admitting it was a promotional gimmick".[35]
On May 31, 2007, Asthmatic Kitty announced that Stevens would be premiering a new project titled The BQE in early November 2007. The project, dubbed a "symphonic and cinematic exploration of New York City's infamous Brooklyn-Queens Expressway", was manifested in a live show. The BQE featured an original film by Stevens (shot in Super 8 mm film and standard 16 mm), while Stevens and a backing orchestra provided the live soundtrack. The performance used 36 performers which included a small band, a wind and brass ensemble, string players, horn players, and hula hoopers. There were no lyrics to the music. The BQE was commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of their Next Wave Festival and performed on three consecutive nights from November 1–3, 2007.
The performance sold out the 2,109 seat BAM Opera House without any advertising.[43] After three weeks of rehearsing the piece with the three dozen musicians[44] involved, he presented the 30-minute composition. The BQE was followed by an additional one hour of concert by Stevens and his orchestra. The BQE won the 2008 Brendan Gill Prize.[45]
The multimedia package was released on October 20, 2009. The release included a CD of the show's soundtrack, a DVD of Brooklyn-Queens Expressway footage that accompanied the original performance (not a film of the performance itself), a 40-page booklet with liner notes and photos, and a stereoscopic 3D View-Master reel. A limited edition version that features the soundtrack on 180-gram vinyl and a 40-page BQE-themed comic book starring the show's hula hooping wonder women, the Hooper Heroes, was also released.
On October 6, 2009 Stevens' label released an album of versions of his 2001 album Enjoy Your Rabbit rearranged for strings and performed by the Osso String Quartet, entitled Run Rabbit Run.[46]
In 2010, Stevens was featured on The National's album High Violet, released in May, and sang backing vocals for the band on the Late Show with David Letterman.[47] Following the release of High Violet, band frontman Matt Berninger mentioned that Stevens was recording a new album in the band's studio and that The National would appear on some of the tracks. In early August, Stevens announced North American tour dates across dozens of cities. On August 20, 2010, Stevens suddenly and unexpectedly released a new collection of tracks, the All Delighted People EP, for digital download. The EP is built around two versions of the title track, "All Delighted People."[48] The EP surprisingly rose to #27 on the Billboard 200 albums solely through its digital sales.[49] On August 26, Asthmatic Kitty announced that Stevens would release his newest full length album, The Age of Adz, on October 12.[50] NPR streamed the album until it was released on October 12, 2010.[51]
The two albums featured a wide range of arrangements, from orchestral to electronic. Song lengths were also extended; the track "Djohariah" from All Delighted People is 17 minutes long, while "Impossible Soul" from The Age of Adz is 25 minutes long. The albums also feature many styles from disco to folk.
Stevens has stated in interviews that in 2009/10, he suffered from a mysterious debilitating virus infection that affected his nervous system. He experienced chronic pain and was forced to stop working on music for several months.[52] He said: "The Age of Adz, is, in some ways, a result of that process of working through health issues and getting much more in touch with my physical self. That's why I think the record's really obsessed with sensation and has a hysterical melodrama to it."[53]
On October 12, 2010, Stevens began his North American tour in Montreal, featuring virtually all new material. The tour lasted just over a month and ended on November 15, 2010 in New York.
Stevens toured Australia and New Zealand in early 2011, featured as part of the Sydney Festival, and appeared on-stage with The National during the last of three sold-out Auckland shows.[54] He also toured Europe and the United Kingdom in April and May 2011, playing there for the first time in five years.[55] His shows mostly consisted of new material, but he did play many older tracks from Seven Swans and Illinois. Stevens ended the Age of Adz tour with two shows in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York.
On February 27, 2012, it was announced Stevens would release a collaborative EP called Beak & Claw on March 20 with artists Son Lux and Serengeti under the name S / S / S on the Anticon record label.[56]
Stevens released a 7" with close friend Rosie Thomas for Record Store Day 2012, entitled Hit & Run Vol. 1.[57]
Stevens, along with fellow Brooklyn musicians, Nico Muhly and Bryce Dessner began performing their classical project, Planetarium, a song-cycle based around the planets in our solar system in countries such as England, The Netherlands, Australia and France from March to July 2012.[58]
On October 2, 2012, it was announced that Stevens would release a second set of Christmas albums, Silver & Gold: Songs for Christmas, Vols. 6-10, on November 13, 2012.[59] Silver & Gold contains 58 songs, allowing for a total of 100 when combined with his first set of Christmas albums, Songs For Christmas. To support this new release, Stevens performed in 24 cities around the United States for his 2012 tour titled, “The Sirfjam Stephanapolous Christmas Sing-A-Long Seasonal Affective Disorder Spectacular Music Pageant Variety Show Disaster.”[60]
On December 11, 2012, Stevens released Chopped and Scrooged, a Christmas-themed hip-hop mixtape featuring music from Silver & Gold.[61]
On March 18, 2014, Stevens released the self-titled album, Sisyphus, with Son Lux, and the rapper Serengeti.[62] [63]
Many of his songs have spiritual allusions. He says he does not try to make music for the sake of preaching. "I don't think music media is the real forum for theological discussions," says Stevens. "I think I've said things and sung about things that probably weren't appropriate for this kind of forum. And I just feel like it's not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it's misunderstood."[4]
Such themes are most notable on his album Seven Swans, the songs "Abraham", "Seven Swans", "To Be Alone with You", "He Woke Me Up Again", "We Won't Need Legs to Stand" and "The Transfiguration" refer to Christian themes. In "Abraham", Stevens recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis. The lyrics of "The Transfiguration" appear to follow the Biblical accounts of Matthew 17:1–8, Mark 9: 1–8, and Luke 9:28–36. The title of "All the Trees of the Field Will Clap Their Hands" is a quote from Isaiah 55:12.[64]
During a 2004 interview with Adrian Pannett for Comes with a Smile magazine, when asked how important faith was to his music, he responded, "I don't like talking about that stuff in the public forum because, I think, certain themes and convictions are meant for personal conversation."[3]
Sufjan's most recent music features less clear statements about religion and spirituality. In an interview released on October 12, 2010 (the same day as Sufjan's album The Age of Adz released), Sufjan acknowledged that he is a Christian.[65]

Sufjan Stevens was born in Detroit,  Michigan, and grew up in the chilly upper  reaches of the Lower Peninsula. A self-taught  musician, the young Sufjan pounded out elaborate Mozartian sonatas on a toy  Casio, and by college became proficient on the oboe, recorder, banjo, guitar,  vibraphone, bass, drums, piano, and other instruments too numerous to mention.  Somewhere along the line he also started to sing, though at the time his  friends didn't encourage it. He bought a 4-track tape cassette recorder and  painstakingly composed 90-minute concept albums for The Nine Planets, The 12  Apostles, and The Four Humors. He read William Blake, William Wordsworth, and  William Faulkner. At that time, in college, the world loomed large and  daunting, and Sufjan's music came to sound like a medieval woodwind ensemble  waving swords and torches at the twelve-headed dragon of death. During his last  semester in college, Sufjan pruned, picked, and assembled a selection of these  songs to produce the inaugural release 'A Sun Came' on Asthmatic  Kitty Records, a home label Sufjan initiated with his step-dad Lowell. A thousand copies were manufactured  and shipped to a dark, dank closet somewhere in the vacuous black hole of the  universe, where they shifted and snored in their sleep for several years to  come.   Sufjan then moved to New York City  and lived bohemian style, with three other college graduates, in the  unfashionable financial district, commuting by bike to The New School for  Social Research, where he was enrolled in the masters program for writers.  There he met Jhumpa Lahiri, harassed Philip Gourevitch on the telephone, and  tried unsuccessfully to complete an epic collection of stories and sketches  about backwoods Midwestern kinsmenChristian Fundamentalists, Amway salesmen,  crystal healers all set in a small rural town in Michigan. Hmmmm. No one  seemed very interested. Sufjan went back to the 4-track, tired of 'words,  words, words,' and set out to complete his most ambitious project to date:  a collection of programmatic, symphonic songs for the animals of the Chinese  Zodiac. There were no lyrics, but more than a few cymbal swells, flourishes on  the oboe, and ambient organ drones, all accompanied by computer-generated  techno beats, and digital noise. The result was enterprising, but not quite  flattering. He sent a few copies to press, which fell on confused ears.  '...A hyper-modified Atari battling a souped-up Colecovision in a chess  match/battle royal,' one writer noted. Feeling inspired, Sufjan dropped  off a copy at New York's  favored record store, Other Music, only to find it in the used section, reduced  price, two weeks later. Sufjan took this as a compliment. His label did not.  Write songs, his step-dad insisted. Write something with words and melodies.  Sufjan went back to the books, mainly his own unwritten one. Taking bits and  scraps of unfinished stories (character sketches, plot lines, penciled  diagrams) Sufjan began to arrange his misshapen fiction into the bold mechanics  of song, making friends with line breaks, meter, and rhyme scheme. These things  led to melody, odd time signature, and a litany of jingle jangles on the drum  kit, which had been taken out of storage once and for all. Here and there, on  weekend trips, in quiet gasps of free time, Sufjan carried around his 8-track,  recording songs in people's homes, in cinderblock basements, in barn houses and  rehearsal rooms. The vibraphone in Massachusetts,  the electric organ in New Jersey, his sister's  husband's grand piano, upstate Michigan.  Word by word, note by note, everything came together like one great cosmic  shuffle, the Big Bang. The result was a lushly orchestrated road trip through  the backwoods of The Great Lake State, from motor-city to the winter beaches of  Lake Superior. Now this is more like it! his  step-dad said. This sounds pretty good! They decided to release it to the  public, to act like a real record label. They found a distributor, a publicist,  a booking agent, a make-up artist, a mime. Things were looking good. People  lent an eager ear. The critics lowered their knives and their critical brow.  Other Music put it in New Releases, top shelf! Europeans weren't offended!  Sufjan began to feel gallant and bold and confident about this great place  called Planet Earth. This is just the beginning! he proclaimed over  loudspeakers. This is just the tip of the iceberg! Galvanized by tourist  brochures, road atlas maps, and the spirit of Walt Whitman, Sufjan began to  intimate at other songs for other states, the American Dream, the national  anthem, the continental rigmarole, the Delaware shuffle, Florida flamenco,  California swing, all dramatized in song, the great epic symphony, in 50  movements, in 50 years! Lord help us!  Once the clang and clamor of patriotism subsided, Sufjan's musical inquiry fell  fast on the Land of Lincoln, stirred, perhaps, by sentimental  recollections of his rebellious young adulthood on Clark Street in Chicago, Wrigleyville, the beachfront parks,  the homeless kids with their pets, the abandoned school house, where he slept  on a desk. During the winter of 2004, Sufjan spent four months in isolation,  reading books and biographies, memorizing the unfashionable poems of Carl  Sandburg, laughing and shuddering through Saul Bellow's novels. He uncovered  police blogs and books on tape. He solicited correspondence from old friends,  Illinoisans once lost or estranged; he studied travel guides; he quizzed chat  rooms; he made stuff up. All research, he decided, begins with your imagination  and with your intuition, relying heavily on the convictions of the heart.  During those long winter hand-clapping, piano-playing, drum-rolling months,  Sufjan's heart began to expand, leaving its fist-shaped mark on a series of  songs that not so much pay homage to the Prairie State, but rack and rend its  characters through potato farms, steel factories, street fairs, marching  parades, convoluted rivers, and centuries past and present. The result was  something bold, flashy, and ripe with advertisement, like the Goodyear blimp,  but not without Sufjan's tender rendering of the imagination. When all was said  and done, Sufjan felt irrevocable changes taking place within his body, like a  second puberty. His shoulders broadened, his mind quickened, his heart began to  beat with quiet, patient thumps in a rhythm as fluid and faithful as the Chicago River.   And so on and so forth.   Sufjan's other interests include graphic design, painting, running, knitting,  crocheting, weaving, quilting, cleaning, photography, haircutting, and dry wall  installation. He collects stamps and wheat pennies. He cooks legendary omelets  and can whip up a sushi feast at the drop of a sake glass. In high school he  played second string guard on a district champion basketball team and created  his own language, now spoken by only two other people. His brother Marzuki is a  nationally recognized marathon runner, elite status. His sister Djohariah has  the most complicated, most whimsical, most monumental laugh in all of mankind.

Sufjan Stevens is a songwriter, composer, and multi-instrumentalist who harbors a conceptual, thematic approach to making albums. "The music I write is entrenched in traditions of folk music, but it has very grand, romantic aspirations that more closely resemble the music of institutions, of academia," says Stevens. "I love the concept of recording, making albums, as an artform; I’ve always loved the album as format. I find [working with a concept] really liberating."
Stevens' best-known concept is his '50 States project,' in which he set out to author an album for every State in the Union. The ever-ambitious artist appeared earnestly intent on attempting such, but, after stalling on two albums (2003's Michigan and 2005's Illinois), Stevens has distanced himself from it. "The whole premise was such a joke," he told Paste, in 2009, "and I think maybe I took it too seriously."
Stevens was born and raised in the seedy suburbs of Detroit, before his family —a Brady-esque sprawl that included three elder siblings, one elder step-sister, and a younger half-brother— relocated to Petoskey, a small timber town on the edge of Lake Michigan, when Stevens was nine. As a teenager Stevens studied piano and oboe at Interlochen, a private Christian art-school in Northern Michigan, but after a school-mandated mission to rural Jamaica, Stevens determined that he wanted to be a writer.
"I wanted to write books; I loved to tell stories, I loved reading," Stevens would tell me, in 2007. "I loved music, but I loved it in a very non-personal, non-emotional way... I approached [it] with a technical, mechanical, schooled method. It wasn't at all tapping into that creative, emotional side of me."
That only came when Stevens went to university, at small, liberal-arts Hope College in rural Holland, Michigan. With his mother's ex-husband, Lowell Brams (with whom Stevens would later found his own Asthmatic Kitty label), feeding him a diet of Nick Drake and Terry Riley, Stevens picked up the guitar. Though he "was really clumsy and naïve" and fumbled out "pointless and meaningless" songs, Stevens could feel his life shifting tack. "Writing songs really changed everything for me," he said.
Yet, in his first band, Marzuki, Stevens didn't write the songs; deferring to songwriter Shannon Stephens as he played piano, guitar, and recorder. After Marzuki "felt like a failure" upon their break-up, Stevens thought he'd never perform his own songs, and moved to New York "determined to be a writer" and happy to have music, his college "distraction," be but a hobby.
Suitably enough, Stevens' first two albums —2000's collection of beginner's bedroom recordings, A Sun Came, and 2001's instrumental electronic extrapolation of the Chinese Zodiac, Know Your Rabbit— were barely-noticed affairs. Yet, with Stevens' literary ambitious leading only to fruitless networking, he begun to treasure the musical connections he'd made with Christian-revivalist big-band jamboree The Danielson Famile and whimsical one man band Half-Handed Cloud. It was they who helped Stevens on his break-out third album, Michigan.
The first record in what was proposed as a 50-album project, Michigan found an audience not just through its mix of quiet folksongs and busy modernist compositions, but its ambition. "It was meant as a provocative remark, a proclamation," Stevens explained, of the endeavor. "It really wasn't based on reality, it was more about the psyche of beginning this thing."
Stevens' next album was, in terms of the States Project, a side-step: 2004's elegant, poignant, folkie Seven Swans a song-cycle of veritable hymnals steeped in biblical imagery and filled with questions of faith. It proved just as thematically-taught as Know Your Rabbit and Michigan, and served to effectively 'out' Stevens as a Christian Musician.
In subsequent years, Stevens would come to lament entering such a realm. "I don't think music media is the real forum for theological discussions," says Stevens. "I think I've said things and sung about things that probably weren't appropriate for this kind of forum."
In 2005, Stevens would release his second 'state' LP, Illinois; a "celebratory and triumphant" tribute to the Prairie State. A dense, heavily-researched work clocking in at 74 minutes long, it was met with unanimous, exultant acclaim, charted by Metacritic as the best-reviewed record of 2005. Stevens' "monomaniacal" work on the record produced enough material for another record, 2006's The Avalanche, functionally subtitled Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois Album.
Stevens' capped off an incredibly prolific period with the late-2006 release of Christmas, a five-disc box-set of Christmas songs that found Stevens trying to rescue the season from hyper-capitalist kitsch. It seemed, at the time, that 50 states were in his reach.
Yet, in 2007, something strange happened: Stevens went quiet. In truth, he was working on The BQE, a commissioned multimedia performance-piece about the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. The project, Stevens later opined, "derailed the momentum" he had from Illinois. Ever the workaholic, Stevens kept at the grind, but all of a sudden his efforts seemed to be elsewhere; like turning The BQE into a DVD release, or presiding over a chamber-quartet reinterpretation of Know Your Rabbit titled Run Rabbit Run.
Promoting these twin 2009 releases, Stevens gave a confessional interview to Paste that explained his hiatus. "I no longer really have faith in the album anymore. I no longer have faith in the song," Stevens admitted. "I'm wondering, why do people make albums anymore when we just download?"
Stevens returned from his pseudo-hiatus in 2010, first with the digital EP, All the Delighted People, which was released instantly, and unexpectedly. Then came his sixth album, The Age of Adz. Showing Stevens had rediscovered his "faith in the song," it was his most pop LP, an album bordering on a Sufjan version of electro-soul. Strangely, neither EP nor LP was a whole, thematic work.
In 2012, Stevens issued his second five-disc seasonal box-set, Silver & Gold: Songs for Christmas, Vols. 6-10.

=======================================================
A singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Detroit-born Sufjan Stevens started venturing into the music world while attending Hope College as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band based in Holland, Michigan. Following the release of two full-length albums with the group, Stevens decided to go solo in late 1999, investing fully in a career that was waiting to shine by itself. Sun Came, his debut album, appeared in 2000, confirming his superior musical command, complex instrumentation, and sparkling melodies. The promotion of the disc included playing on the road with the Danielson Famile, with whom he began regularly working. The heavily electronic Enjoy Your Rabbit, a song cycle concerning the animals of the Chinese zodiac, hit record stores in 2001, followed in 2003 by Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State, a 15-track conceptual piece produced and performed by Stevens -- he played over 20 instruments -- that placed his home state under the writer's microscope. Despite the record's narrowed focus, it was among the best reviewed work that year and made many critics' year-end lists. In 2004, Stevens released his follow-up, Seven Swans, a thoughtful, spiritual, and quasi-mystical collection of standalone songs produced by Danielson Famile mastermind Daniel Smith. 
Stevens returned to his ambitious "states" project in 2005 with the epic Illinoise (extended title: Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel the Illinoise), which became one of the best-reviewed album of 2005, spawning accolades both regional and international -- it was also smacked with a lawsuit concerning the depiction of DC Comics icon Superman on the cover, who was eventually covered by a balloon sticker and subsequently removed from further pressings. The 21-track Avalanche: Outtakes & Extras from the Illinois Album and the five-disc Christmas box set Songs for Christmas arrived in 2006, followed in 2007 by the instrumental BQE, a self-described "symphonic and cinematic exploration of New York City's infamous Brooklyn-Queens Expressway" that was commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and performed on three consecutive nights (November 1-3, 2007) in front of a film shot by Stevens, who had officially relocated to New York in 2000. Run Rabbit Run, a version of 2001's Enjoy Your Rabbit performed by the Osso String Quartet, and a recorded version, BQE, arrived in October 2009. In 2010, Stevens surprised everybody by releasing All Delighted People, a nearly 60-minute EP of new music. An all-new studio album, the surreal electronic pop manifesto The Age of Adz, arrived later, in October of that year. In 2012 Stevens released the five-EP box set Silver & Gold: Songs for Christmas, Vols. 6-10, the sequel to 2006's Songs for Christmas, Vols. 1-5. ~ Mario Mesquita Borges & James Christopher Monger, Rovi

For one, it was announced a mere six weeks before its release. And then it sounded like little else we'd ever heard from the troubadour-- delicate finger-picking and narrative storytelling were replaced by geyser-like electronic beats and abstract wails. The ensuing tour-- which had Stevens dancing in shiny "space garbage" while hyper-colorful projections popped behind his costumed band-- took his bold new vision even further. The new moves were polarizing, with some fans left confused by the drastic changes. But Stevens isn't backing down. "It's a big shift, and it may not be for some people," he told us matter-of-factly when we recently called him up in Hong Kong, where he was visiting his sister during a break from his Age of Adz tour. The following conversation touches on everything about the artist's latest left turn, including the mysterious illness Stevens fell under while making Adz, how Michael Jackson influenced the album's tour, and what's next for the unpredictable indie star: Pitchfork: What do you say to someone who really loved your previous work but was thrown for a loop by the The Age of Adz album and tour? Sufjan Stevens: I can't apologize for the direction I'm going because it feels necessary and obvious. I know it's confusing because I'm something of an aesthetic nightmare, and I kind of suffer from multiple personality disorder. But that's part of me and my character. So, I guess I don't care. It's a big shift, and it may not be for some people. They should stay home. [laughs] Don't listen to the record; don't buy it. I'm very aware that this material is far less popular and accessible than the kind of songwriting on Illinois. I'm also willing to admit that these songs don't measure up to the songs I was writing five years ago; these aren't great songs in terms of the palpable, fundamental nature of a song. But I'm not interested in songwriting anymore. I'm interested in sound and movement. And this material is all about that. Unfortunately, we sold the tickets to the tour before I even had the record done, so a lot of people didn't really have the chance to know what they were investing in. I apologize for that. Pitchfork: Even more than the album, the subsequent tour was surprising considering all the dancing and neon costumes and vocal effects. Were you nervous about performing this show for the first time?SS: I was nervous because I didn't know if all the elements would come together. But I wasn't nervous about people's perception-- I didn't have time or energy for that. The tour was a lot to manage for me with the size of the band and all of the new visual elements onstage. The whole thing was one big stress ball for me. [laughs] It was the hardest set I've ever done. It was fun, too. Watch Sufjan and his band perform the Age of Adz track "Too Much" on "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon":     Pitchfork: It seems like nothing you do is ever simple-- do you feel like you put yourself in these stressful situations on purpose? SS: [laughs] Yeah, life is all about toiling and labor. But obviously I get great joy in confronting challenge and taking risk. I don't ever want to be comfortable. I think a big element in what I do is public innovation. Even a very simple thing like dancing-- which to anyone else would be normal and natural-- is very alien and weird for me. So I used that as a personal challenge: How can I really embody this music physically and do it in a way that's challenging my own comfort level? In effect, I'm also challenging the viewer because maybe they're not used to me dancing or singing through vocal effects.  Pitchfork: When I caught the show in New York, you played most of the new album and then came back out for an encore of older material. To me, the encore felt anticlimactic; it didn't seem to fit. SS: I do feel like it's obvious that Michigan and Illinois don't really work with this stuff, and that's why the set is almost all from the new record. It's important to keep it separate. During the encore, I'm just throwing a bone to those few people who were probably really frustrated with the show. I don't want to condescend to my former self and to my material-- that's irresponsible. You have to take account for everything you write and stand by it. But I agree with you. The older songs don't sit well with this stuff, and it feels like there's something very naïve about them. I still think it's important that they have a life beyond me and my own ability to embody them. The songs are not my own. I'm a populist in that sense, where I don't want to be too protective of it. I don't want to take away a person's experience at a show. They own that experience, and that's theirs to have.  Pitchfork: How much thought did you put into the show's dancing? SS: The dancing was a major and necessary element. Most of what I was doing was improvised, but the girls' dancing was all worked out, and it was a big part of the conceptual vision of the show. For me, movement was the salvation in the whole thing. The music didn't really matter. I was less invested in language and in wordplay and creating themes and characters-- I purposefully wanted to dumb that down because it was more about the body and physically participating in the songs. Even though it's not like a huge laser-light production, there was so much work involved. Pitchfork: Do you ever go to any big shows at places like Madison Square Garden? SS: Almost never. I wanted to see Lady Gaga or Justin Bieber because I wanted to see what the high-production thing really looks and feels like. But I think the biggest show I went to last year was Arcade Fire at Madison Square Garden, and there wasn't really that much production to it. They have enough energy onstage that they don't really need all that. But my resolution this year is to really seek out these big production shows and try to get tickets. Pitchfork: Why are you interested in seeing those sorts of shows? SS: There's an element of that in what I'm doing, and I just want to see how it's done the right way. I don't think we're doing anything the right way, really. We're going through the motions, and the gestures are there. Like, the girls who are singing with me are singers, not dancers. They can dance, but it's not like a Michael Jackson-backup-dancers kind of thing. We were looking at old Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson YouTubes when we were working through the choreography, so I want to know what people are doing now. I watched the Michael Jackson documentary  This Is It and was really surprised at how inspired I was by it-- just the work that goes into that kind of production and how invested the dancers were and also how hands-on Michael Jackson was. He was there directing everything. He had real vision for the show, and all the decisions he was making were based on the body and movement. I realized for the first time that all of his music is based on physical ideas. They'd be working through something, and he would explain a musical gesture with his body. That was really educational.     Pitchfork: Your moves made me think of David Byrne and the Talking Heads concert film Stop Making Sense. SS: David Byrne is the foundation on which a lot of us are building our careers because Talking Heads were all about content but without explanation or justification. There's obviously meaning in a lot of Talking Heads songs, but he wasn't holding himself accountable, and he let the music, beats, body, and dance explain the songs for him. I think a lot of music-- including my show-- is based on that now. Pitchfork: What were some other aesthetic inspirations for the show? SS: I was really into TRON-- those outfits and colors and the lasers. And prog-rock stuff like Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Yes, and Rick Wakeman-- all that corny stuff from the 70s. I was listening to some of that, too. And maybe Parliament-- not that what I'm doing is like Parliament-- but just the outfits and the idea of funky space jams. Everything seems kind of drug-induced but it's not. We're very sober when we're onstage, for better or for worse. [laughs] Pitchfork: I read about how you were dealing with a mysterious ailment while making this album. Does that have any connection with your current focus on the body and movement? SS: Yeah, possibly. Because when you're sick-- whether it's a serious illness or a flu-- you're an invalid and there's a real physical debilitation. After going through that and finding wellness in the end, I really wanted to celebrate movement and touch and physicality. I never really mediated on my body so much before, and it was really important to me. Pitchfork: Do you know exactly what was wrong with you? SS: I don't. It was like the flu or a virus or an allergic reaction where I had all these weird symptoms. And I was extremely tired for a long time, like I had mono. No energy, no appetite. I also had these weird nervous-system things: pins and needles, numbing, pains shooting up and down my legs. It was these weird, outer space sensations that I had never felt before. And even though I saw all these doctors and did all this holistic stuff, I never got to the bottom of it. It went on in waves for months and months and then finally dissipated. While reading about other weird nervous-system illnesses, I realized there's so much we don't even know about. It's such a black hole in terms of science and knowledge. Pitchfork: Do you think having your mortality put in front of you like that contributed to this album's sense of urgency? SS: For sure. It was traumatic, and that induces an anxiety and desperation in one's life and work. There's a sense of urgency in understanding that your body is not really your own. We can control it to a certain extent through habits and good behavior, but there's so much we don't have control of. A virus is an invasive thing, a microscopic attacker. You just have to live through it.  Pitchfork: One of the main inspirations behind The Age of Adz was schizophrenic outsider artist Royal Robertson. He seemed to have a lot of anger and misogyny in his work-- how did you relate to his manic perspective? SS: His work has a lot of issues, but I was attracted more to his aesthetic and lack of boundaries. I know people who knew him personally and they said that-- in spite of the real anger in his art-- he was a real gentleman and that he had utmost respect for women. So there was this discrepancy in his work and his character. We all contain multitudes and have the potential for extreme kindness and vengeance at the same time. That's a crude generalization, but if you read the newspaper you have a sense of what we're capable of as human beings. And he embodied that as a person in his art. I find a lot of folk art to be quaint and cute and naïve, but Royal's work is very violent, and there are parts of it that are very pornographic, too. There's an adult nature to it, and at the same time, it's also really childlike. It's really disturbing, and I felt like I needed to meditate on that. Pitchfork: Did you connect with Robertson's obsessive nature with regard to his art? SS: Once his wife and family left him, he didn't really have a life outside of his art. His work was like a community that he created. I suppose that's what art is: this fantasy world that we create and live in. Some of my music requires an obsessive-compulsive approach and a real embodiment of excessiveness. So I really have to live in that world of overstimulation. Sometimes I think it's like a drug; more is more, and you can never get enough. The older I get, the more I crave that excessive aesthetic. It's never going to satisfy me. Pitchfork: Do you look at Royal as a cautionary tale? SS: Not so much. Well, maybe. I want to shy away from a morality discussion with Royal, because I don't know enough about him to know what was going on in his mind. Really, he was sick. He had schizophrenia, and that was the outcome. But his work and his illness were so conjoined. They necessitated each other in some ways. It's unfortunate that he died a lonely man in poverty. But I don't know if there was any other option for him. If there's any kind of morality, for me, it's about reality; what is reality? I have a hard time distinguishing what is valuable when it comes to the real world and the fantasy world. Like, should I invest my time in the ordinary world or the imaginary world? Royal made a decision and completely escaped the ordinary world. Maybe that's enlightenment. Maybe that's what it's like to be in heaven. I don't know. For me, the sensory pleasure of sound and music is so transcendent that I begin to distrust it and worry if it's a distraction from ordinary life. Maybe I should be spending my time doing something else, like start a family. Or build an amusement park-- actually, that's still a fantasy world. Engineering? Investment banking? Real estate? There are all kinds of people who make the world go 'round. [laughs]     Pitchfork: You once said that you were considering quitting music. SS: Yeah, I'm always playing with the idea. Because I had other plans, you know? I wanted to be a graphic designer, a teacher, a writer. We all have our plans, but they're worth nothing. There's a sequence of events that takes over. But I'm not quitting now. I'm fully embracing the life of the musician. Pitchfork: Do you think we'll have to wait as long for another album from you next time? SS: No, I'm not going to do that anymore. I want to start releasing a lot more and do it without the orthodoxy of a proper release. I want to do more download EPs like All Delighted People, too. I'm always writing and recording anyway, so I think it's healthier to make things available even if they don't have a complete, conceptual form. Pitchfork: Do you have a bunch of finished songs on some hard drive somewhere? SS: [laughs] Yeah, I have a lot of really weird stuff. I don't know if anyone wants to hear it. Pitchfork: Weirder than The Age of Adz? SS: Oh yeah. I did some stuff with my stepdad, Lowell-- Music for Insomnia-- a couple years ago, and it was like improvised noise. That's really where my heart is, unfortunately. I'm less interested in songwriting and more into just making noise.

=======================================================
Sufjan Stevens (pronounced “SOOF-yahn”; born July 1, 1975) is an American musician, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist from Petoskey, Michigan. He is known for his lyrically focused and instrumentally rich songs that often relate to faith and family. He has enjoyed wide critical success in the United States. He is considered part of the folk revival through indie pop, but his influences are very broad, including experimental electronic music, the jazz of Vince Guaraldi, and the academic minimalism of Steve Reich and Philip Glass. 
Though Stevens had announced plans to make an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, beginning the series with the albums ‘Michigan’ (2003) and Come On Feel The Illinoise!’ (2005, officially named just ‘Illinois’), he has since then somewhat retracted the statement. “Sufjan Stevens is not going to write a record for each of the 50 states after all” was the original text included on the online liner notes for ‘Mews Too: An Asthmatic Kitty Compilation’ , a disc released on February 7, 2006. This statement was possibly included as a joke, as the text has since been removed and the current liner notes related to Sufjan Stevens reads: “Sufjan Stevens can fold a fitted-sheet (he once worked as a professional folder in a commercial Laundromat).” 
Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in the city of Petoskey in that same state. He attended Hope College on the west coast of Michigan.
The name Sufjan is an Arabic/Persian name that predates Islam and most famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a figure from early Islamic history. It has been mentioned in the press that the name was given to Stevens by the leader of Subud, a spiritual sect to which his parents belonged when he was born. Stevens has stated that the name is of Armenian origin and means “comes with a sword,” and that it is “a charming militaristic Muslim name.” In fact the name is not Armenian, and Armenia is a predominantly Christian country.
Sufjan is also the plural form of Sufi in Persian . Sufi is a practitioner of Sufism .This word is frequently used in the old Persian literature ,specially Sufi poetry .  
His brother, marathonist Marzuki Stevens, has trained to compete in the 2008 Olympic trials, and has played on two of Sufjan’s albums.
A multi-instrumentalist, Stevens plays the banjo, guitar, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums through the use of multi-tracking. While in school, he studied the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums; he is one of the few musicians in popular music to use these instruments.
Sufjan Stevens began his musical career as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band from Holland, Michigan. He also played (and continues to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. While in school at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, A Sun Came, which he released on asthmatic kitty records, a record label he founded with his step-father in 1999. He later moved to New York City, where he was enrolled in a writing program at the New School for Social Research.
While in New York, Stevens composed and recorded the music for his second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese Zodiac that ventured into electronica.
Stevens followed this with the first of his 50 states albums, a collection of folk songs and instrumentals inspired by his home state of Michigan. The result, the expansive Michigan, included odes to cities including detroit and Flint, the Upper Peninsula, and vacation areas such as Tahquamenon Falls. Melded into the scenic descriptions and characters are his own declarations of faith in God, sorrow, love and the regeneration of Michigan.
Following the release of Michigan, Stevens compiled a collection of songs recorded previously into a side project, the Christian folk album Seven Swans, which was released in March 2004.
Next he released the second in the 50 states projects, entitled Come On Feel The Illinoise!. Among the subjects explored on Come On Feel The Illinoise! are the cities of Chicago, Decatur and Jacksonville, the serial killer John Wayne Gacy, the poet Carl Sandburg, and Mississippi Palisades State Park.
He has contributed to the music of Denison Witmer, Soul Junk, Half-Handed Cloud, Brother Danielson, Danielson Famile, Serena Maneesh, Castanets, and Liz Janes. He played piano on for fellow Brooklyn musician’s The National’s album 2007 Boxer. A cover of “She Is” is included on the album Dream Brother, released in the United States on January 31, 2006.
Sufjan contributed a lot to the sound of the 2001 Liz Janes album Done Gone Fire as he engineered, recorded, produced and arranged it as well as playing many addition instruments.
Sufjan recently recorded with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. It is unknown how this record will be released. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas were having a baby together, but were forced to print a retraction. Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools’ prank.
Beginning with Michigan, Stevens announced an intent to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, although in interviews he wavers between utter sincerity and self-deprecating irony when describing the idea.
Stevens spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the second of these projects, this time focusing his efforts on Illinois. As with Michigan, Stevens used the state of Illinois as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. 
The widely acclaimed Come On Feel The Illinoise! was the highest rated album of 2005 on the Metacritic review aggregator site, based on glowing reviews from Pitchfork, The Onion A/V Club, Spin, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and The Guardian. The 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards awarded Stevens with the Album Of The Year, Best Album Art/Packaging, and Male Artist Of The Year. Pitchfork Media and Paste Magazine named Come On Feel The Illinoise! as the editors’ choice for best album of 2005 and Stevens received the 2005 Pantheon prize, awarded to albums selling 500,000 copies or fewer, for Come On Feel The Illinoise!. In April of 2006, Stevens announced that 21 pieces of music he had culled from the Come On Feel The Illinoise! recording sessions would be incorporated into a new album, called The Avalanche. The album was released on July 11, 2006.
The next states to be taken on in the project have been reported as Oregon and Rhode Island. Minnesota may be another candidate; in late 2005 and early 2006 Stevens played a new instrumental track titled “The Maple River.” The Maple River mentioned in the title of the song runs through several counties in southern Minnesota. Sufjan also recorded “The Lord God Bird”—a song about the ivory-billed woodpecker rediscovered in Arkansas (known as the ‘lord god’ or ‘great god’ bird because of its breathtaking appearance)—in connection with a National Public Radio piece in which “independent radio producers Dan Collison and Elizabeth Meister were curious about how Stevens writes his songs.”
Many of Stevens’ songs have religious and spiritual allusions, but his album Seven Swans has the most direct religious references. Stevens has expressed that he is Christian, but does not overtly advertise this aspect of himself in his music. Stevens has also stated that he does not try to make music “with a message”, or music for the sake of preaching. “I don’t think music media is the real forum for theological discussions,” says Stevens. “I think I’ve said things and sung about things that probably weren’t appropriate for this kind of forum. And I just feel like it’s not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it’s misunderstood.”
The songs ‘Abraham’, ‘Seven Swans’, ‘To Be Alone With You’, ‘We Won’t Need Legs To Stand’ and ‘The Transfiguration’ directly address Christianity on the album Seven Swans. In ‘Abraham’, Sufjan recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis when Abraham, ordered by God as a test of faith, leads his son, Isaac, up a mountain and prepares to kill him, as commanded (but before God sends an angel to intervene). The lyrics of ‘The Transfiguration’ follow the Biblical accounts of Jesus’ Transfiguration in Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9: 1-8, and Luke 9:28-36.
Michigan and Come On Feel The Illinoise! are packed with Christian references and metaphors. Michigan contains “Sleeping Bear, Sault Saint Marie”, which implores “Oh Lamb of God! Tell us Your perfect design and give us the rod” (“Lamb of God” being a Biblical name for Jesus Christ). The song “Oh God, Where Are You Now?” asks God to “hold me now”, to “save somehow”, searching for God in the midst of personal turmoil. “There’s no other man who could save the dead,” the song states. The album closer, ‘Vito’s Ordination Song’, was apparently originally written for Sufjan’s friend Vito Aiuto, and its lyrics allude directly to Psalm 139 (“I always knew you. In your mother’s arms, I have called your name”, “I’ve made a crown for you”). The song speaks of “When the bridegroom comes” - the New Testament speaks of Jesus Christ as being the Bridegroom and the Church His Bride, finally being united together at the End of Time.
Come On Feel The Illinoise! features the song ‘Chicago’ with its refrain of “You came to take us, to recreate us”, and ‘Decatur’ has the chorus of “It’s the great I Am” (“I Am” being the name the Lord reveals Himself by to Moses in Exodus 3:14). “Casimir Pulaski Day” speaks of “All the glory that the Lord has made” in the midst of personal pain and loss. “The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out To Get Us!” has the lyrics: “Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelujah!” One instrumental passage has the title of “In This Temple as in the Hearts of Man for Whom He Saved the Earth”. “The Seer’s Tower” speaks of Emanuel, “With His sword, with His robe He comes dividing man from brothers” (an interesting side note is that “Sufjan” actually means “comes with a sword”). Indeed, the vast majority of songs of Come On Feel The Illinoise! contain lyric lines which can be readily identified as having a basis in Stevens’ faith in Christ.
Sufjan’s second, electronic album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, contains a song cycle based on of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, culminating with the song “Year of our Lord”. Stevens released the original, Christian-themed song “God’ll Ne’er Let You Down” on the “To Spirit Back the Mews” compilation on Asthmatic Kitty. The officially unreleased Christmas albums Sufjan Stevens made and then compiled into Songs for Christmas feature suitably Christmas and Christian themed music, both originals and covers of hymns and traditional songs.
On Snow Patrol’s 2006 album Eyes Open there is a reference to Sufjan and the song “Chicago” in the song “Hands Open” - “Put Sufjan Stevens on and we’ll play your favorite song/”Chicago” bursts to life and your sweet smile remembers you.”
The film “Little Miss Sunshine” featured pieces of two songs from Come on Feel the Illinoise in its soundtrack.
Sufjan has twice been featured on the FOX television show “The OC”. “To Be Alone With You” and “For The Widows In Paradise, For The Fatherless In Ypsilanti” can be heard on episodes 202 and 315, respectively.
Sufjan Stevens’ music has appeared twice on the Showtime dark comedy “Weeds”. “All The Trees Of The Field Will Clap Their Hands” appears on S1E02 over the end credits, and “Holland” appears near the end of S2E10.
Two of Sufjan’s songs appear on the soundtrack to “Little Miss Sunshine”: “Chicago” and “No Man’s Land”
In the TV show “Austin City Limits”, he mentioned that when he was a kid, he and his best friend saw something in the sky which they couldn’t figure out. They thought it was a spaceship or UFO first, then an eagle or a dragon. Finally they realized it was a giant wasp. He wrote the song “The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!” about the incident and mentioned that the reason they (the band) all have wings on stage is to overcome his fear of flying things.
The song “Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou)” is heard in the 2012 “World of Red Bull” television commercial. he is quoted as saying “selling out never looked so good.” and “somebody had to pay for all of that Christmas confetti.” referring to his recent Christmas album and supporting tour.

                            Memoro is an international non-profit project, an open archive of audio or video interviews of people born before 1950.
                    You can easily contribute: a camera, a smartphone, a webcam or an audio-recorder is enough. 
                            If you are an Association, a Museum or an Archive, share your contents with more 
                            We need your help to improve the project, to collect more memories and preserve them for the future, to develop Memoro projects in new Countries, to keep the site free from advertising.
