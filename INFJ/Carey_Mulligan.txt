=======================================================
Carey Hannah Mulligan[1] (born 28 May 1985)[2] is an English actress. She made her film debut as Kitty Bennet in Pride & Prejudice (2005). She has had roles in several British television programmes such as Doctor Who, Bleak House, and Northanger Abbey. In 2008, she made her Broadway debut in the revival of Chekhov's The Seagull to critical acclaim.[3][4][5]
In 2009, she gained widespread recognition for her performance as Jenny in An Education, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and for which she won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[6][7] She was also nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She has gone on to star in The Greatest, Never Let Me Go, Drive, Shame, The Great Gatsby, and Inside Llewyn Davis.
Mulligan was born in Westminster, London, England, to a middle-class family.[8][9] Her father, Stephen, was originally from Liverpool, and her mother, Nano (née Booth), is from Llandeilo in West Wales.[1][10] Her father is of Irish descent.[11]She has an older brother, Owain, who is a captain in the British Army and has served in Iraq and Afghanistan.[12][13] Mulligan's mother is a university lecturer and her father is a hotel manager.[10][14] Her parents met while they were both working in a hotel in their twenties. When she was three, her family moved to Germany when her father was hired to manage a hotel there. While living in Germany, Mulligan and her brother attended the International School of Düsseldorf.[15] At eight, she and her family moved back to England. As a teenager, she was educated at Woldingham School in Surrey, England.[16]
Her interest in acting sparked from watching her brother perform in a school production of The King and I when she was six. During his rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play. They let her join the chorus.[12] While enrolled in Woldingham School as teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions.[17][18] When Mulligan was 16, she attended a production of Henry V starring Kenneth Branagh. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief that she wanted to pursue a career in acting. Mulligan wrote a letter to Branagh's mail listing asking him for advice. "I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, but that I felt it was my vocation in life," she said. Kenneth Branagh's sister wrote back to Mulligan saying, "Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress."[12]
Mulligan's parents disapproved of her acting ambitions and wished for her to attend a university like her brother. At age 17, Mulligan applied to three London drama schools, instead of the universities that she was expected to submit an application to, but did not receive a subsequent offer.[12] During Mulligan's final year at Woldingham School, actor/screenwriter Julian Fellowes delivered a lecture at her school on the production of the film Gosford Park. Mulligan briefly talked to Fellowes after the lecture and asked him for advice on an acting career. However, Fellowes dissuaded her from the profession and suggested that she "marry a lawyer" instead. Undeterred, Mulligan later sent Fellowes a letter in which she stated that she was serious about acting and that the vocation was her purpose in life. Several weeks later, Fellowes's wife Emma invited Mulligan to a dinner for young, aspiring actors that she and her husband were hosting to offer advice. The dinner event facilitated an introduction between Mulligan and a casting assistant that led to an audition for a role in Pride and Prejudice. Mulligan auditioned on three occasions and eventually attained the role of Kitty Bennett.[12][14][19][20] During her late teens and early twenties, Mulligan worked as a pub barmaid and an errand-runner for Ealing Studios in between acting jobs.[19][21]
In 2004, at the age of 19, Mulligan made her professional acting debut on stage in the play Forty Winks at the Royal Court Theatre in London.[22][23] She made her film debut following year in Pride & Prejudice, the 2005 period piece film adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, portraying Kitty Bennet. Later that year, she auditioned for and won the role of orphan Ada Clare in the BAFTA award-winning BBC adaption of Charles Dickens' Bleak House, her television debut.[24] Among her 2007 projects were My Boy Jack, starring Daniel Radcliffe that features her in a supporting role. Mulligan identified with her role Elsie, who vociferously opposes her brother going to war.[25] She earned a Constellation Award for playing the main character Sally Sparrow in an episode of Doctor Who.[26] She rounded out 2007 by appearing in an acclaimed revival of The Seagull, in which she played Nina to Kristin Scott Thomas' Arkadina and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Trigorin. The Daily Telegraph said her performance was "quite extraordinarily radiating'" and The Observer called her "almost unbearably affecting."[25] While in the middle of the production, she had to have an appendectomy, preventing her from being able to perform for a week.[25] For her debut Broadway performance in the 2008 American transfer of The Seagull, she was nominated for a Drama Desk Award, but lost to Angela Lansbury.[27]
Her big breakthrough came when, at 22, she was cast in her first leading role as Jenny in the 2009 independent film An Education, directed by Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig and written by Nick Hornby. Over a hundred actresses auditioned for the part, but Mulligan's audition impressed Scherfig the most.[28][29] The film and Mulligan's performance received rave reviews, and she was nominated for an Academy Award, Screen Actors Guild, Golden Globe, and won a BAFTA Award. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly and Todd McCarthy of Variety both compared her performance to that of Audrey Hepburn.[30][31] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers described her as having given a "sensational, starmaking performance,"[32] while Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Mulligan had one of the year's best performances,[33] and Toby Young of The Times felt she anchored the film.[34] Writing in The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw concluded that she gave a "wonderful performance."[35] Mulligan was a recipient of the Shooting Stars Award from the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival[36] and received a BAFTA Rising Star Award nomination, which is voted on by the British public.[37]
Mulligan next starred in independent film The Greatest (2009) as the pregnant girlfriend of a boy who dies. Her involvement with the project helped it "tremendously", according to the director.[38] After being selected to join The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,[39] she won a British Independent Award for Never Let Me Go, an adaption of the 2005 Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, in which she starred and narrated. It was released in September 2010, competing against her other project, the Oliver Stone-directed film Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.[37] Screened out of competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival,[40] it was her first major studio project.[41] Later that year she also provided vocals for the song "Write About Love" by Belle & Sebastian.[42]
Mulligan returned to the stage in the Atlantic Theater Company's off-Broadway play adaptation of Ingmar Bergman's Through a Glass, Darkly, from 13 May – 3 July 2011.[43] Mulligan played the central character, a mentally unstable woman, and received glowing praise from reviewers.[44] Ben Brantley, theater critic for The New York Times, wrote that Mulligan's performance was "acting of the highest order"; he also described her as "extraordinary" and "one of the finest actresses of her generation.",[45]
Mulligan co-starred in the critically acclaimed 2011 neo-noir thriller Drive, directed by Danish filmmaker Nicholas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks. Mulligan was nominated for her second BAFTA award—Best Supporting Actress—for the film. Drive garnered a total of 4 BAFTA award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director.[46] Mulligan began filming Steve McQueen's sex-addiction drama Shame alongside Michael Fassbender in New York in January 2011.[47] Drive debuted at 2011 Cannes Film Festival and Shame debuted at 2011 Venice Film Festival, both to good reviews. Of her performance in Shame, Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers wrote, "Mulligan is in every way sensational."[48]
She starred as Daisy Buchanan, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, in The Great Gatsby, which was released in May 2013.[49][50] Mulligan auditioned for the role of Daisy in the fall of 2010. While attending a Vogue fashion dinner in New York City in November 2010, she received the news that she landed the part from Luhrmann’s wife, Catherine Martin. In May 2012, Mulligan was a co-chair alongside Anna Wintour for the Gatsby-themed 2012 Met Ball Gala.[51][52]
Mulligan will star in the upcoming Far from the Madding Crowd of Thomas Hardy's novel Far from the Madding Crowd for director Thomas Vinterberg and Fox Searchlight.[53][54] She is also set to star in The Fury for director Sarah Gravron and screenwriter Abi Morgan, who previously worked with Mulligan on Shame.[55]
In February 2014, Mulligan was announced as star in the revival of the play Skylight with Bill Nighy and Matthew Beard to be directed by Stephen Daldry at London's West End.[56]
Mulligan is married to Marcus Mumford, the lead singer of Mumford & Sons. They were childhood pen pals, lost touch and reconnected as adults[57][58] They married on 21 April 2012, a few weeks after wrapping production on the Coen brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis, with which they were both involved.[59]
Aside from acting, Mulligan was among the actresses who took part in the Safe Project—each was photographed in the place she feels safest—for a 2010 series to raise awareness of sex trafficking.[60] She donated the Vionnet gown she wore at the 2010 BAFTAs to the Curiosity Shop, which sells its donations to raise money for Oxfam.[61]
Mulligan became the ambassador of the Alzheimer's Society in 2012, with the goal of raising awareness and research funding for Alzheimers and dementia. Her grandmother suffers from Alzheimers and no longer recognizes her.[62][63] She helped host and participated in the 2012 Alzheimer's Society Memory Walk and was one of the sponsored Alzheimer's Society runners in the 2013 Nike Run to the Beat half-marathon in London.[64][65]

      Received a 2009 Drama Desk Award nomination for "Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play" for her role in Christopher Hampton's re-imagining of Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull" on Broadway.
      Won "Best Female Performance in a 2007 Science Fiction Television Episode" for the Doctor Who (2005) episode Doctor Who: Blink (2007), at The Constellation Awards (2008).
      Mentioned in an interview at the Sundance Film Festival that the first actor she met was Julian Fellowes, who came to talk at her school. She approached him, and he introduced her to casting director Jina Jay's assistant; at the time, they were looking for young unknown actresses to play the younger sisters in Pride & Prejudice (2005). It ended up being her first job.
      Lived in London from birth until the age of three before moving with her family to Germany, where she attended the International School of Dusseldorf.
      (August 2009-October 2010) Was in a relationship with Shia LaBeouf, having met on the set of Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010).
      Replaced Keira Knightley in the role of Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady after she dropped out of the project.

      Was originally cast as Violet in Violet & Daisy (2011) but was replaced by Alexis Bledel after she dropped out in order to pursue Drive (2011) instead.
      Announced her engagement to Marcus Mumford, having been in a relationship with him since February 2011. [July 2011]
      Married Marcus Mumford in a rustic farmhouse in Somerset before 200 guests, including actors Colin Firth, Jake Gyllenhaal and Sienna Miller. Mulligan wore a plain, backless ivory gown, had 8 bridesmaids and Mumford's father, a vicar, officiated the ceremony.
      Ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society; her maternal grandmother has suffered with the disease since 2000.

      Was childhood penpals with future husband Marcus Mumford, but the two lost touch before reconnecting as adults and later marrying.
      Was originally advised by Julian Fellowes not to become an actor and "Marry a lawyer instead". She later sent him a letter saying that she was serious about it and was invited to a dinner for aspiring actors.
      Was inspired to become an actor at sixteen after seeing a performance of Henry V starring Kenneth Branagh.
      About her Pride & Prejudice (2005) co-stars: We were like one big family. We took over the house. It was so much fun. Brenda Blethyn (Mrs Bennett) mummied us all - when we had days off she took us on day trips to a llama farm.
      (About Pride & Prejudice (2005)) I love it when we're a family unit, I mean we've been sort of split up in various pieces, but when we are presented as the Bennetts, in that scene where we go to Netherfield where it is a Miss Bennett, a Miss Bennett, a Miss Bennett and a Mrs Bennett. I just like that we're all together.
      (About Jena Malone in Pride & Prejudice (2005)) I think Jena helped a lot because I have sort of leaned on her the whole summer basically, a) in my character and b) just because she is so much more experienced than I am. She kind of psyches me up for stuff and sort of helps me get in the giggly frame of mind.
      (About her school) "I had wanted to act for a really long time, but other schools I had been to did not have such good drama departments. Everyone was so encouraging. You could do anything you wanted to, although you had to take it seriously. If you missed rehearsals, you were out."
      (About Kitty and Lydia Bennett) "They completely relate to all of the giggling and gossiping, and especially when the militia arrive we put ourselves into the most ridiculous, lovely costumes and we just have to stand out."
      I thought, 'Wow! That's why I am here! One day Al Pacino is going to ask me for a cup of tea and notice my potential. And then I am going to skyrocket!' -- on taking a job as a runner at a studio and spotting Al Pacino arriving to rehearse The Merchant of Venice (2004).
      There were older men who used to come in. One guy had a red Ferrari, and one night, when I gave him his check, he signed it 'Dinner?' I freaked out! I was definitely not Jenny; she was bolder than I was. She had more to escape from. -- on working at a pub and comparing herself to her character in An Education (2009).
      My generation tends to play it cool these days. But there is no room for cool. You have got to be irritating and desperate, and if you are not it is terribly boring -- on landing a role in Pride & Prejudice (2005) and becoming friends with co-star Keira Knightley.
      My parents were completely against it. They wanted me to go to a university. They didn't know any actors; no one in my family was an actor. They were scared.
      I love love stories, I love acting in love stories, I like portraying love stories. So I suppose that's the romantic side of me, but I am quite practical.
      [on Shame (2011)] When I read the script, I found it terrifying. My English agents sent it to me and said, "There's this amazing part." For me, as an actor, it was sort of scary. I'd seen Hunger (2008), which was done by Steve McQueen, and I thought it was just incredible. And I'd always wanted to work with Michael Fassbender. So, I asked to have a meeting with Steve to pitch myself for the job.
      [on Never Let Me Go (2010)] I read the book when it came out, and I always loved. I loved it first and foremost as a love story and about people who want very simple things from life and can't get them. Keira Knightley and I did Pride & Prejudice (2005) together and we've done lots of adaptations of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen, where the author is not around to tell you if it's rubbish. And so this was sort of doubly intimidating, because we had Kazuo Ishiguro with us, and you want to be everything that he imagined when he wrote it.
      I'm very rarely recognized in public. I go about pretty happy. It just gets heightened around the time you're releasing something like this ['The Great Gatsby']. And then people are suddenly very interested, but for a brief amount of time, which is fine.
      If you're walking down the street in L.A., people do sort of look at you like you're a hooker because it's so rare to see someone just walking.
      I didn't feel like I was cool enough to go to a tattoo bar. They'd just laugh at me. So I went to Selfridges. Sanitary, if not rock'n'roll.
      [on her audition for The Great Gatsby (2013)] It was me, Leonardo DiCaprio and Baz Luhrmann, who was shooting from five different angles. There were four other people in the scene and Leo played every single character, jumping around the room.
      I spent the first five years of my career thinking that everyone behind the camera had little notepads and were making my performance out of ten.
      The idea of not having any control over what you're doing is terrifying. I was never very rebellious. The one and only bad thing I've done is have a super-heroes party when I was 16.

She also won a BAFTA award, the British counterpart to the Oscars, for the same role.

=======================================================
Carey Mulligan was born in Westminster, London, England into a middle-class family. Along with her parents and her brother Owain, she moved to Germany when she was three years old and returned to England five years later. As a child, Carey discovered her love of acting while at Woldingham School in Surrey and thereafter pursued an acting career voraciously, even though her parents disapproved. 
As a teenager, she wrote a letter to famed director/actor Kenneth Branagh asking for advice on whether she should become an actress. His sister replied, telling Carey that if she felt such a strong desire to be an actress, then she should pursue that path. At 17 years old, she applied, but failed to get into, several acting schools. That didnât deter her at all; her perseverance in asking for advice from prominent individuals in the industry eventually led to her making contact with a casting assistant. The connection resulted in her auditioning for and nabbing of the role of Kitty Bennett in Joe Wrightâs Pride & Prejudice (2005) with Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen and Donald Sutherland.
Careyâs role in the film quickly ushered her into more demanding roles, such as that of Ada Clare in BBCâs adaptation of Charles Dickensâ Bleak House alongside Gillian Anderson. For the next few years, she starred mainly in British television series, including The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard, Waking the Dead, and Doctor Who, as well as television movies, most notably the WWI drama My Boy Jack with Daniel Radcliffe. Around this time, Carey also received critical acclaim for her performance in the London theatrical production of The Seagull, which also starred Kristin Scott Thomas and Chiwetel Ejiofor.
It was in 2009âs An Education that finally found Carey stepping fully into the spotlight. She played Jenny Mellor, a teenager who falls for a playboy in 1960s England, and was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, Golden Globe, and Screen Actorâs Guild Award, and won a BAFTA for her role. After that, she began to consistently land high profile roles. She appeared in Public Enemies with Johnny Depp, Brothers with Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps with Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf, and as Kathy in Never Let Me Go with Andrew Garfield and her friend from Pride & Prejudice, Keira Knightley. For her heart-wrenching role in the film, she won a British Independent Film Award, although the movie failed to garner any acting Oscar nominations. For a time, she went back to the theater and has since taken on riskier film roles in Drive with Ryan Gosling and Shame with Michael Fassbender.
Most recently, Mulligan has appeared in Baz Luhrmannâs The Great Gatsby, based on the book by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the Coen Brothersâ movie Inside Llewyn Davis, which premiered at Cannes. Careyâs personal life took off just like her careerin April 2012, she married childhood pal Marcus Mumford, the lead singer for the band Mumford & Sons. She is also using her fame as an ambassador for the Alzheimerâs Society. She currently lives in England.

In his highly acclaimed novel Never Let Me Go, Kazuo Ishiguro (The Remains of the Day) created a remarkable story of love, loss and hidden truths.

Now director Mark Romanek (ONE HOUR PHOTO), writer Alex Garland and DNA Films bring Ishiguro's hauntingly poignant and emotional story to the screen.
Kathy (Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan, AN EDUCATION), Tommy (Andrew Garfield, BOY A, RED RIDING) and Ruth (Oscar nominee Keira Knightley, PRIDE & PREJUDICE, ATONEMENT) live in a world and a time that feel familiar to us, but are not quite like anything we know.

No one could stop Dillinger and his gang.  No jail could hold him.  His charm and audacious jailbreaks endeared him to almost everyone-from his girlfriend Billie Frechette (Cotillard) to an American public who had no sympathy for the banks that had plunged the country into the Depression.  
But while the adventures of Dillinger's gang, later including the sociopathic Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) and Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), thrilled many, Hoover (Billy Crudup) hit on the idea of exploiting the outlaw's capture as a way to elevate his Bureau of Investigation into the national police force that became the FBI.  He made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy Number One and sent in Purvis, the dashing Clark Gable of the FBI.''  
However, Dillinger and his gang outwitted and outgunned Purvis' men in wild chases and shootouts.  Only after importing a crew of Western ex-lawmen (newly baptized as agents) and orchestrating epic betrayals, from the infamous 'Lady in Red' to the Chicago crime boss Frank Nitti, were Purvis, the FBI and their new crew of gunfighters able to close in on Dillinger.
