This article is about the actor.  For the television fictional character, see Ed Norton (Honeymooners).  For other uses, see Edward Norton (disambiguation).
Edward Harrison Norton[1] (born August 18, 1969) is an American actor, screenwriter, film director and producer. In 1996, in his debut film, his supporting role in the courtroom drama Primal Fear garnered him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Two years later, his lead role as a reformed white power skinhead in American History X earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
His other performances are diverse in range and include supporting roles in the biographical drama The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), the comedy Everyone Says I Love You (1998), and the comedy-dramas Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring roles in the cult hit Fight Club (1999), 25th Hour (2002), The Illusionist (2006) and Leaves of Grass (2009) (in which he acted against himself), a rare villain turn in The Italian Job (2003) and an unrecognizable appearance in Kingdom of Heaven (2005).
In addition to acting, Norton has experience writing and directing films. He made his directorial debut with the film Keeping the Faith (2000). In addition to this, he performed uncredited work on the scripts for The Score, Frida, and The Incredible Hulk. He also appeared as a character in all of these films. He starred as Jack Teller in The Score, alongside Robert De Niro, and as Dr. Bruce Banner, the alter-ego of the Marvel Comics superhero the Hulk in The Incredible Hulk. He also had a minor role in Frida as Nelson Rockefeller.
In his private life, Norton is an environmental and social activist. He is a member of the board of trustees of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit organization for developing affordable housing, founded by his grandfather, James Rouse. Norton is president of the American branch of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust.[2] He ran in the 2009 New York City Marathon to raise money for the Trust.[3] He also raises money for charity through Crowdrise, a social networking community for volunteers and a micro-donations fundraising platform.[4] In July 2010, Norton was designated as the United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.[5]
Edward Norton was born in Boston, Massachusetts,[6] and raised in Columbia, Maryland.[7] His father, Edward Mower Norton, Jr., was an environmental lawyer and conservation advocate working in Asia, as well as a former federal prosecutor in the Carter administration. His mother, Lydia Robinson "Robin" (née Rouse), a teacher of English, died of a brain tumor in 1997.[8][9] His maternal grandfather was the developer James Rouse (founder of The Rouse Company), who developed the city of Columbia, Maryland (where Norton grew up), helped develop Baltimore's Inner Harbor, Norfolk's Waterside Festival Marketplace, and Boston's Quincy Market, as well as co-founded Enterprise Community Partners with Norton's maternal step-grandmother, Patty Rouse.[8] Norton has two younger siblings—Molly and Jim, with whom he has professionally collaborated. From 1981 to 1985, along with his brother, Norton attended Camp Pasquaney, on the shores of Newfound Lake in Hebron, New Hampshire. There, he won the acting cup in 1984, and later returned to the camp's council for two years, directing theater. He maintains close connections with the camp.[8]
Norton was raised Episcopalian.[10] He graduated in 1987 from Columbia's Wilde Lake High School, where his classmates included New York City Council member Mark Levine[11] and best-selling author Robert Kolker.[12] He attended Yale University, where he was a competitive rower[13] and acted in university productions alongside Ron Livingston and Paul Giamatti, graduating in 1991 with a Bachelor of Arts in History.[8]
Following graduation, Norton worked in Osaka, Japan, consulting for his grandfather's company, Enterprise Community Partners. Norton speaks some Japanese.[14][15] He appeared in an EFL textbook, Only in America, used by Nova, a formerly major English language school in Japan.[16]
Norton moved to New York City and began his acting career in Off-Broadway theater,[8] breaking through with his 1993 involvement in Edward Albee's Fragments, at the Signature Theatre Company. His first film was 1996's Primal Fear, which tells a story of a defense attorney (Richard Gere), who defends Aaron Stampler (Norton), an altar boy charged with the murder of a Roman Catholic archbishop. The movie is an adaptation of William Diehl's 1993 novel.[17] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: "Norton gives a performance that's fully the equal of Gere's – he's as slyly self-effacing as Gere is slyly ostentatious."[18] Alison Macor of The Austin Chronicle, in review of the film, wrote, "Norton's performance and the well-paced tension preceding the movie's climactic sequence provide an entertaining if slightly predictable thriller."[19] Despite the mixed reviews,[20] Norton won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[21][22] That same year, Norton appeared as lawyer Alan Isaacman in The People vs. Larry Flynt.
In 1998, he played Derek Vinyard, a reformed neo-Nazi, in the film American History X.[23] David Denby of The New Yorker noted that Norton gives Derek "ambiguous erotic allure; he's almost appealing".[24] American History X received positive reviews[25] and grossed over $23 million worldwide at the box office.[26] His performance earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.[22] Also in 1998, Norton starred opposite Matt Damon in Rounders, a movie following two friends who need to quickly earn enough cash playing poker to pay off a huge debt.[27]
In the 1999 film Fight Club, Norton played the nameless protagonist, an everyman and an unreliable narrator who feels trapped with his white-collar position in society. The film, an adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, was directed by David Fincher.[28] To prepare for the role, Norton took lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling.[29] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival.[30] During promotion for the film, he said, "I feel that Fight Club really, in a way ... probed into the despair and paralysis that people feel in the face of having inherited this value system out of advertising."[31] The film failed to meet expectations at the box office,[32] and received polarized reactions from film critics.[33] However, it became a cult classic after its DVD release.[34] In 2008, Fight Club was named the 10th greatest movie of all time by Empire Magazine in its issue of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.
In 2002, he starred in Brett Ratner's Red Dragon as FBI profiler Will Graham and in Spike Lee's 25th Hour. While Red Dragon received mixed reviews, it was commercially successful. 25th Hour was praised by critics, particularly for its examination of a post-9/11 New York City, but failed to break even.[35][36] In 2003 Norton was forced by Paramount Studios, under threat of lawsuit having signed a three-film contract when he signed up for Primal Fear, to appear in The Italian Job (2003), for which he accordingly refused to promote upon its release.[37][38] Norton won critical acclaim for his role as Baldwin IV, the leper king of Jerusalem, in Kingdom of Heaven.[39] Norton portrayed Marvel Comics character Bruce Banner / the Hulk in the Marvel Studios film The Incredible Hulk, released in 2008.[40] Norton's failed attempt to rewrite the film along lines of his own choosing resulted in his refusal to promote the film.[38] He had been expected to reprise his role as the character in the 2012 film The Avengers,[41] but the role was later confirmed to have been given to Mark Ruffalo.[42]
In 2006, Norton starred in two films: Down in the Valley, as a dangerous drifter affecting to be a cowpoke, and in The Illusionist, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and later became a sleeper hit when it went into general release. In 2010, Norton appeared in two films again: in Leaves of Grass, as estranged identical twins (one a small-time drug dealer and the other a Harvard professor); and in Stone, which reunited Norton with his The Score cast-mate Robert De Niro, and in which Norton plays a convict trying to con his parole officer (De Niro) into an early release. In 2008, Norton starred in New Line Cinema's Pride and Glory, as an honest detective assigned to investigate the precinct run by his older brother. The film was not well received by critics, not strongly supported by the studio, and despite also starring Colin Farrell and Jon Voight, its worldwide grosses totaled only $31.1 million, against a production budget of $30 million.[43]
Norton played himself in a cameo role in the experimental comedy show Stella,[44] and made another comedic television appearance on the Emmy award-winning ABC show Modern Family in 2010, playing a fictional member of real life '80s new wave band Spandau Ballet. In the 2012 movie The Bourne Legacy, he is the antagonist Eric Byer.
Norton has also done uncredited script work on some of the films he has appeared in, specifically The Score, Frida,[45] and The Incredible Hulk. In 2000, Norton made his debut as a director with Keeping the Faith. He will also direct the film adaptation of the novel Motherless Brooklyn.
Norton has a reputation of being a perfectionist. He managed to receive final cut of American History X, clashed with the director while shooting Red Dragon, and (with the director) clashed with the studio during the shooting of The Incredible Hulk (and refused to do promotion for it).[46]
In 2013, Norton starred in The Lonely Island's music video, Spring Break Anthem, alongside Andy Samberg, Zach Galifinakis, James Franco, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. The video premiered on Funny or Die's Between Two Ferns during a segment between Galifinakis and Franco.[47]
On February 20, 2014, it was announced that Norton would begin production of the long-gestating adaptation of Motherless Brooklyn in fall 2014, with Brett Ratner acting as producer.[48]
In June 2014, Norton's Class 5 Films and RatPac Entertainment acquired the movie rights to the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Major Frederick Russell Burnham, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import hippopotamuses into the Louisiana bayous and to convince Americans to eat them. The movie will highlight the Burnham - Duquesne rivalry, two famous spies who had previous been under orders to assassinate each other. Norton, William Migliore and Brett Ratner will produce this feature film.[49]
After six years of dating, Norton became engaged to Canadian film producer Shauna Robertson in 2011, and they married in 2012.[50] They have one son, born in March 2013.[51]
Norton is generally known for his reluctance to embrace his celebrity status, and has said, "If I ever have to stop taking the subway, I'm gonna have a heart attack."[52] Norton has stated in interviews that he is a fan of the Baltimore Orioles,[53] and was involved in many of Cal Ripken Jr.'s retirement activities in 2001 when he was asked to be a part of Ripken's biography for Major League Baseball (MLB).[53] He attended Ripken's ceremony at the Hall of Fame in July 2007.[54] Norton has a private pilot license and discussed his flight training when interviewed on episodes of the Late Show with David Letterman and Inside the Actor's Studio.[55]
Norton was a strong supporter of former New York State Governor Eliot Spitzer.[56] Norton is a member of the board of trustees of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit developer of affordable housing based in his hometown. He is also well known for his support for environmental causes and renewable energy projects, such as Enterprise's Green Communities Initiative and BP's Solar Neighbors program.[57][58][59] He also put time and money toward social activist causes, including improving the quality of living in low-income communities.[60][61]
Norton's work with the HBO documentary By the People: The Election of Barack Obama led to a soundtrack, with proceeds going to Enterprise Community Partners and United Way. Norton also participated in a 2008 Fast Company story about Enterprise's green affordable housing.[62]
Norton is president of the American branch of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust.[63] To raise money for the trust, Norton fielded a team of 30 runners in the New York City Marathon on November 1, 2009.[64] The team included Alanis Morissette and David Blaine.[65] Norton finished the event first among celebrities with a time of 3 hours, 48 minutes.[3] Norton and his team raised over $1 million for the Trust.[3][66] In May 2010, Norton launched a website called Crowdrise, which uses a social networking platform to help raise funds for charity.[67]
In May 2012, Norton played football for an 'England vs. The Rest of the World' match the charity event Soccer Aid along with other actors such as Will Ferrell and Woody Harrelson. The event eventually raised over £4,000,000 for UNICEF UK.[68]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Edward Norton was born on August 18, 1969 to parents Edward, an attorney who works for the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Robin Norton, a former foundation executive and teacher who passed away of brain cancer on March 6, 1997. Edward also has two younger siblings named James and Molly. From the age of 5 onward, the Yale graduate (majoring in history) has always been interested in acting. At the age of 8, he would ask his drama teacher what his motivation in a scene was. He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee's Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, Primal Fear (1996). The role was offered to Leonardo DiCaprio but he turned it down. Gere was on the verge of walking away from the project, fed up with the wait for a young star to be found, when Edward auditioned and won the role over 2000 other hopefuls. Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Primal Fear (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in American History X (1998). This performance would earn him his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor. In 1999 came the critically acclaimed Fight Club (1999) and in 2000 came his directorial debut in Keeping the Faith (2000).
      Following graduation, he worked in Osaka, Japan, consulting for his grandfather's company, Enterprise Foundation, which works to create decent, affordable housing for low-income families.
      On his return to New York, it took less than two years of waiting tables before the young thespian to capture the eye of Edward Albee, one of the most celebrated playwrights of the 20th century. Albee was working with the Signature Theater Company on a new production of Fragments. One audition and Norton landed the role, as well as a slot in Signature's repertory company. He currently serves on its board of directors.
      He played guitar with Courtney Love's band, Hole, in two gigs in Los Angeles, in December 1998.
      In July 1998, after a New Yorker jibe in a review of a documentary about Courtney Love, Norton sent the magazine a frameable letter. Norton's missive was in response to Endless Love, a piece by Daphne Merkin centering on Nick Broomfield's controversial documentary Kurt & Courtney (1998). The film, filled with speculation that Love's husband Kurt Cobain death was murder rather than suicide, features a litany of Love-haters anxious to air their grievances. The magazine's coverage of Broomfield's film "along with Merkin's thoughtful contributions" didn't sit well with Norton.
      When Norton met with the director for Primal Fear (1996), he told them that he, like Aaron, came from eastern Kentucky. Norton even spoke with the twang (which he prepared by watching Coal Miner's Daughter (1980)).
      His character Aaron Stampler in Primal Fear (1996), which was based on a book, did not have a stutter, but when he auditioned he gave him one.
      (June 29, 2000) Was one of the few celebrities invited to Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston's Malibu wedding.
      He and Rounders (1998) co-star Matt Damon competed in the World Series of Poker at Las Vegas on May 1998 with the movie studio Miramax paying the $10,000 per person entrance fee.
      His character, Worm, in Rounders (1998) was originally supposed to smoke but being avid non-smoker, he refused and the part rewritten as a non-smoker.
      He worked as a waiter, a proofreader, and a director's assistant to try to get his foot in the door in New York City. He applied to be a New York City cab driver, but he was rejected for the license because he didn't meet the age requirement.
      Speaks some Japanese, which helped when he worked, briefly, for his grandfather's company, The Enterprise Foundation. He was assigned to the Osaka, Japan branch until he quit the desk job grind at his grandfather's suggestion and decided to try to break into acting in New York.
      Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, Maryland, where Edward graduated in 1987, built a new auditorium for the performing arts several years ago. He revisited his alma mater and gave a lecture on the day of the dedication. It is named after Edward's grandfather, James Rouse.
      Received a B.A. in history from Yale in 1991, but took many theater and Japanese courses as an undergraduate. He has said in interviews that he took as many theater courses as he could without majoring in theater.
      The theme song for Keeping the Faith (2000) - "Heart of Mine" by Peter Salett - was not written specifically for the film. Salett is a good friend of Edward's.
      According to Yale's newspaper, he has wanted to play the poet Dylan Thomas for a long time, but feels he's not physically right for the part.
      While a precocious 8-year-old actor, he asked a surprised director of a play, "What is my objective here?" The director was startled by his interest in acting.
      His babysitter, Betsy True, went on to perform as Cossette in a Broadway version of Les Miserables. She was the one who originally piqued Edward's interest in acting, taking him to see his first play, If I Were A Princess, at age six.
      Auditioned for the role of 'Rudy Baylor' in the movie The Rainmaker (1997). The role eventually went to Matt Damon.
      Got the role for Fight Club (1999) because director David Fincher enjoyed his performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), which was the only film of the actor that he had seen.
      Was considered for the role of Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon (1999). Director Milos Forman could not decide between him and Jim Carrey and left the decision up to the studio. The studio decided to go with Carrey.
      Holds benefit screenings of his films mostly at The Senator Theatre in Baltimore, MD to benefit some charities that includes the Living Classroooms Foundation and the St. Frances Academy Robin Norton Scholarship Fund in honor of his late mother.
      Played "The Captain" in a VH1 Captain & Tennille Behind the Music skit on Saturday Night Live (1975) with Drew Barrymore. The show aired the night before the 1999 Oscars where he was a nominee for American History X (1998). Barrymore accompanied Edward to the Oscars.
      His grandfather, James Rouse, designed the planned community Norton was raised in - Columbia, Maryland.
      Did NOT attend the famed Yale Drama School, as reported in many news paper articles. He attended Yale merely as an undergraduate.
      As a response to the events of September 11th and the increasing conflict in the Middle East, he contributed to establish the Middle East Peacemakers Fund at Yale University.
      Was attached at one point to star in Hart's War (2002) but walked away from the project and an $8 million salary. The role later went to Colin Farrell.
      He served as Artistic Director for the Signature Theatre Company in New York from 2001-2003. He is currently still on the board.
      Was 33 years old when he played Will Graham in Red Dragon (2002). His predecessor, William Petersen, was also 33 years old when he played the same role in Manhunter (1986).
      He treasures his private life and being able to live a normal life - and can't imagine not being able to take the New York subway if he gets too famous.
Stuart Blumberg, Edward's friend from his Yale college days, wrote most of what was to become the basis for Keeping the Faith (2000). Edward starred, produced, and directed the romantic comedy, but he also assisted Stuart in writing the original story.
      Credits legendary acting coach Terry Schreiber as being a major reason behind his success as an actor. The story was that Norton, who speaks Japanese, worked a deal with Schreiber to trade acting lessons for Norton teaching Schreiber Japanese. Schreiber was to direct a play in Japan at the time, and agreed to the deal. Norton studied with Schreiber for about three years in the early 90s in New York, and his career subsequently took off.Norton wrote the introduction to Schreiber's 2005 acting text "Acting: Advanced Techniques for the Actor, Director, and Teacher".
      Like fellow film actors Peter Sarsgaard, Kimilee Bryant and Jeanine Louise DeName, he studied at New York City's famous T. Schreiber Studio.
      Is an active member of Friends of The High Line, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and reuse of the High Line - a 1.5 mile elevated railway that runs along the West Side of Manhattan. Norton appears in a video made by Good Mag about the conversion of the old rail line into a multi-use trail.
      Turned down the role of Bruce Banner in Hulk (2003), but took the part in The Incredible Hulk (2008).
      Studied with renowned Hollywood Gun Coach Thell Reed, who taught other actors as: Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Ben Foster and Girard Swan.
      Auditioned for roles in With Honors (1994), Hackers (1995), and Up Close & Personal (1996) before his film debut in Primal Fear (1996).
      Specializes in characters with multiple personalities, be it as a mental defect or a disguise. He has played people with several identities in Primal Fear (1996), Fight Club (1999), The Score (2001), The Incredible Hulk (2008) and arguably in American History X (1998) in which his character turns 180° during the course of the story and in Death to Smoochy (2002) in which he portrayed a professional actor and his character Smoochie the Rhino.
      Following graduation, Norton worked in Osaka, Japan, consulting for his grandfather's company, Enterprise Foundation. He also appeared in an ESL textbook, Only in America, used by Nova, a major Japanese language school.
      Ran the New York City Marathon in November 2009 in an effort to raise money for the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust.
      Was a big fan of the "Incredible Hulk" comics and played the title character in a 2008 Adaptation.
      His 5 favorite films are: 1. "The Cruise" (1998), 2. "The King of Comedy" (1982), 3. "Tampopo" (1986), 4. "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf" (1966) and 5. "Ruggles of Red Gap" (1935).
      Acting? It's a longstanding compulsion I've had since I was about five or six years old. I can literally identify the moment it struck me. I went to see a play [If I Were a Princess] in which a babysitter of mine [Betsy True, who later acted on Broadway] was performing. I was completely shell-shocked by the magic of this little community-theater play; it just riveted me.
      I'm an actor and, each time out, I'm trying to convince the audience that I'm this character. Every little thing that people know about you as a person impedes your ability to achieve that kind of terrific suspension of disbelief that happens when an audience goes with an actor and character [he's] playing.
      The more you can create that magic bubble, that suspension of disbelief, for a while, the better.
      It's a nice position to be in; I'm lucky. At the same time, all the excitement of that has been put into stark perspective ... In some ways, the highs of it have been blunted, which in a way, is a gift.
      First of all, you never make all things for all people and can't always pander to the broadest denominator. I keep an eye toward doing the themes that interest me. Do they move me? Interest me? Make me think? When I run across something that is provocative in an unsettling way, it appeals to me.
      People wrestle sometimes making movies, and I think that conflict is a very essential thing. I think a lot of very happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies.
      I'm not interested in making movies for everybody. I like making movies for myself and my friends and people with my sensibility.
      I always felt that acting was an escape, like having the secret key to every door and permission to go into any realm and soak it up. I enjoy that free pass.
      Nobody makes me uncomfortable here. It's a place where you can be eternally anonymous. - the reason he loves living in New York City.
      In fact, the United States today keeps on making the same sort of mistakes. We force those methods we think are useful on a few countries, hoping to make a few changes.
      I get heartbroken flying into L.A. It's just this feeling of unspecific loss. Can you imagine what the San Fernando Valley was when it was all wheat fields? Can you imagine what John Steinbeck saw?
      Just because you've made a couple movies, you've done some good movies, you've been nominated for some Academy Awards, whatever, nobody's entitled. It's a business. If they don't see it, I can think they're wrong, but I'm not entitled to a $15 million budget to make a film.
      He has such a rich mellifluous voice. Anytime I would hear him speak, it would remind me of how flat my voice is. (about Ralph Fiennes)
      [on showing Marlon Brando The Simpsons (1989)] I showed him the episode where Marge gets cast in a musical version of "A Streetcar Named Desire". He loved it. Marlon loves stuff like that.
      [on Robert De Niro] I look at De Niro, and the thing I admire about him is just the length and diversity of his career. He has just done so much wonderful work and so many different kinds of work. That to me is worth something.
      I remember when I heard they were making The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), I was like, 'God, if they cheese those out, I'm going to be so disappointed. (But) those films were inspiring to me in terms of deciding to take The Incredible Hulk (2008).
      [on his role as a policeman in Pride and Glory (2008)] I started to have a special interest in this project when I thought this could actually be something that's reflecting the moment we are going through - in terms of a nation and as a culture - regarding a sense of ethics.
      All people are paradoxical. No one is easily reducible, so I like characters who have contradictory impulses or shades of ambiguity. It's fun, and it's fun because it's hard.
      I haven't personally really engaged in a lot of this new kind of social networking stuff like Twitter or Facebook or MySpace. I mean, the notion of people following what I am doing every day is like torture for me. It's absolutely the last thing that I'm looking for. It seems to me to be really just about social chatter.
      When you're working on a creative thing, everyone has an idea, and they're pushing it. The first time you work with anybody, you have to get comfortable with the way another person pushes hard for what they want. Familiarity breeds contempt, people say. But I've found, for creative things, familiarity breeds peace of mind, because you realize you know someone better. You trust each other. You know not to take things a certain way, or a wrong way. You get to where you don't have to waste quite so much time with diplomacy. Things are a little more efficient.
      We've had a seminal legal decision whereby the Supreme Court defined corporations as having the same rights as individuals. It's having a massive impact on our politics. It's unleashed unlimited corporate spending on our elections, which is terrifying. The facade is now fully peeled off. There's no pretense about having limitations over how wealthy individuals and corporations can exert an unhealthy influence on politics with their money. It used to be a game - now no one's pretending any more. Individuals can contribute $20million while previously the maximum was $5,000. It's a radical transformation. You wonder what will occur before people feel it's creating an imbalance which diminishes them.
      I studied music, theater and fine arts. My mother taught English literature and courses on Shakespeare (William Shakespeare). She was a regular theatergoer and I used to go with her. When I was 16, I saw Ian McKellen do a one-man show called Acting Shakespeare. It had an impact on my sense that acting was something you could do as an adult that affected people, that it wasn't just for entertainment, that you could change someone's mind with it. I started performing in the theater a lot more after that.
      There's been a shift from people buying DVDs to streaming them online. The studios have been asleep at the switch and suffered a huge loss of revenue from falling DVD sales. Unfortunately, that revenue was often what helped convince them to make films which aren't blockbusters. Studios aren't as willing to make mid-budget, more thoughtful films aimed at adults. It's more challenging to get those films made than it was.

From All Movie Guide: An actor of unusual talent, Edward Norton attained almost instant stardom with his film debut 1996's Primal Fear. For his thoroughly chilling breakthrough performance as a Kentucky altar boy accused of murder, Norton was credited with saving an otherwise mediocre film and further rewarded with Golden Globe and Oscar nominations. Remarkably disconnected from all of the hype that is usually associated with fresh talent, Norton has gone on to further prove his worth in such films as American History X, The People vs. Larry Flynt, and Fight Club.
The son of a former Carter Administration federal prosecutor and an English teacher, as well as the grandson of famed developer James Rouse, Norton was born in Boston on August 18, 1969. He was raised in the planned community of Columbia, MD, and from an early age was known as an extremely bright and somewhat serious person. His interest in acting began at the age of five when his babysitter, Betsy True (who went on to become an actress on stage and screen), took him to a musical adaptation of {+Cinderella}. Shortly after that, Norton enrolled at Orenstein's Columbia School for Theatrical Arts, making his stage debut at the age of eight in a local production of {+Annie Get Your Gun}. Although young, Norton already exhibited an unusual amount of professionalism and took his subsequent roles seriously. After high school, he studied astronomy, history, and Japanese at Yale, and was also active in the university's theatrical productions. 
After earning a history degree, Norton spent a few months in Japan and then moved to New York, where he worked for the Enterprise Foundation, a group devoted to stopping urban decay. Again, Norton continued acting at every opportunity and eventually decided to become a full-time actor. In 1994, he appeared in Edward Albee's {+Fragments} after deeply impressing the distinguished playwright during an audition. Norton then joined the New York Signature Theater Company, which frequently premieres Albee's plays. With a number of off-Broadway credits to his name, Norton won his role in Primal Fear after being chosen out of 2,100 hopefuls. He nabbed the part after telling casting directors in a flawless drawl that he was a native of eastern Kentucky, the same area where the character came from; legend has it that the actor watched Coal Miner's Daughter to learn the accent. The intensity of Norton's screen test readings stunned almost all who saw them, and the actor became something of a hot property even before the film was released. The same year, Norton was cast as Drew Barrymore's affable fiancé in Woody Allen's tribute to Hollywood musicals, Everyone Says I Love You. Like all of the other actors in the film (excepting Barrymore), Norton did his own singing, further impressing audiences and critics alike with his versatility. Then, as if two completely different films in one year weren't enough, Norton again wowed audiences that same year with his portrayal of a determined defense attorney in Milos Forman's widely acclaimed The People vs. Larry Flynt. 
In 1998, Norton turned in two more stellar performances. The first was as Matt Damon's low-life buddy, the appropriately named Worm, in Rounders. The fact that Norton's work was more or less overshadowed by the film's lackluster reviews was almost negligible when compared to the controversy surrounding his other major project that year, American History X. Norton's stunningly powerful portrayal of a reformed white supremacist won him an Oscar nomination, but the film itself was both a box-office disappointment and the subject of vituperative disassociation on the part of its director Tony Kaye, who insisted that Norton and the studio had edited his film beyond recognition. Despite such embittered controversy, Norton managed to emerge from the mess relatively unscathed. After serving as one of the narrators for the acclaimed documentary Out of the Past the same year, he went on to star opposite Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter in Fight Club in 1999. Though that film garnered a mixed reation at the box office, a stellar DVD release helped the film to form a solid fan base and Norton next moved on to the slightly more successful crime drama The Score (2001). After dropping a full-fledged bomb with his appearance as a naieve children's show host in Danny DeVito's black comedy Death to Smoochy, Norton assisted love interest Salma Hayek by offering an uncredited re-write of the script. Norton would also make a brief appearance as Nelson Rockefeller in the film. Drawn to the mystique of screen villain Hannibal Lecter, Norton's next major was that of FBI agent Will Graham in the well-recieved 2002 thriller Red Dragon. Though a virtual remake of Michael Mann's 1986 effort Manhunter, Red Dragon stood tall enough on its own terms to gain the respect of both fans of the previous version as well as fans of the book. His appearance as a drug-dealer celebrating one last night on the town before serving a prison term in Spike Lee's 25th Hour drew decent enought reviews, though its ultimate take at the box office proved fairly disappointing. 
An appearance in the high profile 2003 remake The Italian Job caused something of a rift in industry headlines when Norton made it publicly known that his participation in the film was strictly a result of contractual obligation, and in 2005 the actor would return to quieter, more challenging territory with his portrayal of a delusional cowboy wannabe in Dahmer director David Jacobson's Down in the Valley. A headlining performance as a turn-of-the-century Vienna magician who uses his powers to win the love of the woman he longs for in the romantic fantasy The Illusionist found Norton making a particularly powerful impression opposite Paul Giamatti and Jessical Biel, and later that same year he would return to the screen in director John Curran's screen adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel {-The Painted Veil}. Meanwhile, the sneaking suspicion that Norton wasn't quite living up to early career expectations was growing difficult to ignore; though his turn as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk drew generally favoriable reviews (it didn't hurt that the film itself was markedly more exciting than Ang Lee's misguided 2003 take on the material), Norton's next film Pride and Glory proved somewhat forgettable, and his quirky duel role in Tim Blake Nelson's Leaves of Grass only recieved a limited theatrical release before getting lost in the shuffle. Poor reviews for Norton's 2010 film Stone didn't help much to reinvigorate his career, and when it was announced that Mark Ruffalo would be taking over the role of Banner in Joss Whedon's all-star comic book romp The Avengers, some feared that the actor's previous rift with Marvel Studios was had come back to haunt him. 
If the last few years had been somewhat disappointing for Norton fans, things appeared to start looking up in 2012, when he took high-profile roles in two eagerly anticipated films -- Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom and Tony Gilroy's The Bourne Legacy. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi

                An Oscar nominee after his debut performance in the 1996 thriller 'Primal Fear', Edward Norton has consistently received rave reviews.Considered by the film industry to be one of the best new actors of the 1990s, he has been likened to a young De Niro or Hoffman. Norton was born in 1969 to parents Edward, a lawyer, and Robin, a former foundation executive and teacher who passed away of brain cancer in 1997. He also has two younger siblings named James and Molly. Norton was always interested in acting. As a precocious child of eight, he demanded of his tutor what his objective in the scene was. A bright student while at Yale reading history, Norton took as many theatre and Japanese courses as possible. After graduation, he went to Japan and worked for his grandfather's company, Enterprise Foundation, providing housing to the poor. Back in New York, Norton fought for two years to find acting work, until he attracted the attention of Edward Albee, the celebrated playwright. Norton's first role was in the production 'Fragments'. At the same time, the director of 'Primal Fear' Gregory Hoblit needed a young actor to play opposite Richard Gere. Norton won the role over 2,000 other applicants and, before the film was even released, he was at the centre of a Hollywood frenzy from which he has yet to fall. He won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as an altar-boy accused of murdering a Catholic archbishop. In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in 'American History X' (1998). This performance would earn him his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor. In 1999 came the critically acclaimed 'Fight Club' (1999), which would go on to be heralded as a defining film for what was loosely termed 'Generation X'. In its efforts at using violence as a metaphor for the disenfranchisement of young people from the wider values of their society, it was likened to such classics as 'Rebel without a Cause' (1967) and 'The Graduate' (1967). That film would also mark the beginning of a purple patch for Norton. In 2000, he made his directorial debut with 'Keeping the Faith' before giving two of his most noteworthy performances in Spike Lee's 2002 drama '25th Hour' and the Bret Ratner-directed 'Red Dragon' (2002), in which he shared the screen with Anthony Hopkins and Ralph Fiennes. He also increasingly took on duties away from the camera, providing uncredited script work for the 2001 crime thriller 'The Score' and 2008's superhero reboot 'The Incredible Hulk'. Now a certifiable A-lister, Norton also took leading roles in these films, as well as in 'The Illusionist' (2006), in which he played the magician Eisenheim, and 'The Painted Veil' (2006), which saw him take the role of a British medical doctor fighting cholera in a Chinese village. Away from the screen, Norton donated $1.1 million in 2004 to the Enterprise Foundation - the largest non-profit developer of low-income housing in America. In 2010, he was designed as the United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity.

Academy Award winner Robert De Niro and Oscar nominee Edward Norton deliver powerful performances as a seasoned corrections official and a scheming inmate whose lives become dangerously intertwined in Stone, a thought-provoking drama directed by John Curran (The Painted Veil, We Don't Live Here Anymore) and written by Angus McLachlan (Junebug). 
As parole officer Jack Mabry (De Niro) counts the days toward a quiet retirement, he is asked to review the case of Gerald "Stone" Creeson (Norton), in prison for covering up the murder of his grandparents with a fire. Now eligible for early release, Stone needs to convince Jack he has reformed, but his attempts to influence the older man's decision have profound and unexpected effects on them both.   
Stone skillfully weaves together the parallel journeys of two men grappling with dark impulses, as the line between lawman and lawbreaker becomes precariously thin. The film's superb ensemble features Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) as Lucetta, Stone's sexy, casually amoral wife, and Golden Globe winner Frances Conroy (Six Feet Under) as Madylyn, Jack's devout, long-suffering spouse.  
Set against the quiet desperation of an economically ravaged community and the stifling brutality of a maximum security prison, this tale of passion, betrayal and corruption examines the fractured lives of two volatile men breaking from their troubled pasts to face uncertain futures.

It was Edward Norton's first time hosting Saturday Night Live this weekend, but he got some helpful advice right at the start from a couple of veterans.
Alec Baldwin and Miley Cyrus made appearances during Norton's opening monologue, with 16-time host Baldwin offering Norton some tips — and Baldwin deadpanning that his turn in American History X was "hilarious." Cyrus basically promoted her upcoming tour and twerked later on in the episode (sigh).

Edward NortonActorBorn: 18 August 1969Birthplace: Columbia, MarylandBest known as: Star of the movie The Fight ClubEdward Norton's 1996 film debut in Primal Fear earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.  A 1991 graduate of Yale University, Norton began his performing career on the New York stage.  His remarkable movie debut was followed by another Oscar nomination for his starring role in American History X (1998) and raves for his performance in Fight Club (1999, co-starring Brad Pitt).  Norton was hailed as one of the best new actors of the 1990s, but the much-publicized conflicts behind the scenes of American History X made him seem less like an exacting professional and more like a rebarbative fussbudget.  A sometime writer and director, his first feature behind the camera was the comedy Keeping the Faith (2000, starring Ben Stiller), and in 2006 it was reported that he was writing and directing Motherless Brooklyn, based on the novel by Jonathan Lethem.  His other roles include the films Rounders (1998, with Matt Damon), Red Dragon (2002, with Ralph Fiennes), The Italian Job (2003, with Charlize Theron), Kingdom of Heaven (2005, starring Orlando Bloom) and The Illusionist (2006, co-starring Jessica Biel).Extra credit: Norton is the grandson of famed urban planner James Rouse...  Norton was briefly romantically linked to Courtney Love, his co-star from the 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt...  Norton's co-star in The Illusionist is Paul Giamatti, another Yale graduate who participated in the school's theater program with Norton.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.
