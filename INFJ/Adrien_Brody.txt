Adrien Brody (born April 14, 1973) is an American actor. He received widespread recognition and acclaim after starring in Roman Polanski's The Pianist (2002), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor at age 29, the only actor under 30 to do so. Brody is also the only American actor to receive the French César Award.
Brody was born in Woodhaven, Queens, New York, the son of Sylvia Plachy, a photojournalist, and Elliot Brody, a retired history professor and painter.[1] Brody's father is of Polish Jewish descent; Brody's mother – who was raised as a Catholic – was born in Budapest, Hungary, the daughter of a Catholic Hungarian aristocrat father and a Czech Jewish mother.[2][3][4] Brody was raised "without a strong connection" to Judaism or Catholicism.[5] As a child, he performed magic shows at children's birthday parties as "The Amazing Adrien".[6] He attended the I.S. 145 Joseph Pulitzer middle school and New York's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts. His parents enrolled him in acting classes to distance him from the dangerous children with whom he associated.[7] He attended summer camp at Long Lake Camp for the Arts in the Adirondacks in upstate New York.[8] Brody attended the Stony Brook University before transferring to Queens College for a semester.
Taking acting classes as a child, by age thirteen he appeared in an Off-Broadway play and a PBS television film.[9] Brody hovered on the brink of stardom, receiving an Independent Spirit Award nomination for his role in the 1998 film Restaurant and later praise for his roles in Spike Lee's Summer of Sam and Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line.[10] He received widespread recognition when he was cast as the lead in Roman Polanski's The Pianist (2002). To prepare for the role, Brody withdrew for months, gave up his apartment and his car, was left by his then-girlfriend,[9] learned how to play Chopin on the piano, and lost 29 lbs (13 kg). The role won him an Academy Award for Best Actor, making him, at 29, the youngest actor ever to win the award, and to date the only winner under the age of 30. He also won a César Award for his performance.
Brody appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 10, 2003, his first TV work, but he was banned from the show after giving an improvised introduction while wearing faux dreadlocks for Jamaican reggae musical guest Sean Paul (the show's producer, Lorne Michaels, is notorious for hating unscripted performances). However, the unscripted intro remains in reruns of the episode. Other TV appearances include NBC's The Today Show and on MTV's Punk'd after being tricked by Ashton Kutcher.
After The Pianist Brody appeared in four very different films. In Dummy (released in 2003 but originally shot in 2000, just prior to his work in The Pianist) he portrayed Steven Schoichet, a socially awkward aspiring ventriloquist in pursuit of a love interest (his employment counsellor). He learned ventriloquism and puppetry for the role (under the tutelage of actor/ventriloquist Alan Semok) convincingly enough to perform all of the voice stunts and puppet manipulation live on set in real time, with no subsequent post dubbing. He played Noah Percy, a mentally disabled young man, in the film The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan, shell-shocked war veteran Jack Starks in The Jacket, writer Jack Driscoll in the 2005 King Kong remake, and father-to-be Peter Whitman in The Darjeeling Limited by Wes Anderson. King Kong was both a critical and box office success; it grossed $550 million worldwide and is Brody's most successful film to date in monetary terms. Additionally, Brody played a detective in Hollywoodland. He has also appeared in Diet Coke and Schweppes commercials as well as Tori Amos' music video for "A Sorta Fairytale".[11] He was also in "Bullet" with Tupac Shakur and Mickey Rourke. This film was released in 1996.
On January 5, 2006, Brody confirmed speculation that he was interested in playing the role of The Joker in 2008's The Dark Knight. However, Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros. decided instead to cast Heath Ledger in the role.[12] He was also in talks with Paramount to play Spock in J. J. Abrams Star Trek XI, but it ultimately went to Zachary Quinto.[13][14] In 2010, he starred in Splice, a science fiction film written and directed by Vincenzo Natali. Originally a Sundance film, Splice was adopted by Dark Castle Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Most recently, he played the star role of Royce in Predators (a sequel to the original Predator), directed by Nimród Antal and produced by Robert Rodriguez.[15]
In 2011, Brody starred in a Stella Artois beer ad called "Crying Beans[Heinz]," that premiered right after half-time of the Super Bowl XLV as part of Stella's "She Is a Thing of Beauty” campaign. He appeared in Woody Allen's 2011 Academy Award-winning comedy Midnight in Paris as Salvador Dalí.[16] On January 16, 2012, Brody made his runway debut as a model for Prada Men Fall/Winter 2012 show.[17]
In 1992, Brody was seriously hurt in a motorcycle accident in which he flew over a car and crashed head-first into a crosswalk.[18] He spent months recuperating. He has broken his nose three times doing stunts; the most recent was during the filming of Summer of Sam.[19]
Brody began dating Spanish actress Elsa Pataky in 2006.[20] For Pataky's 31st birthday in July 2007, Brody purchased her a 19th-century farm that was remodeled to look like a castle in Central New York state. Brody and Pataky were featured at their New York home in a 35-page spread for HELLO! magazine in October 2008.[21] The pair broke up in 2009.[22]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          The son of Hungarian-born photographer Sylvia Plachy and retired history professor Elliot Brody, Adrien Brody grew up an only child in the Woodhaven section of Queens, New York, where he accompanied his mother on assignments for the Village Voice. He credits her with making him feel comfortable in front of the camera. He attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts in New York.Despite a strong performance in The Thin Red Line (1998), time constraints forced the director to edit out much of Adrien's part. In spite of his later work with Spike Lee and Barry Levinson, he never became the star many expected he would become until Roman Polanski called on him to play a celebrated Jewish pianist in Nazi-occupied Warsaw. He pulled off a brilliant performance in The Pianist (2002), drawing on the heritage and rare dialect of his Polish grandmother, as well as his father, who lost family members during the Holocaust, and his mother, who fled Communist Hungary as a child during the 1956 uprising against the Soviet Union.
      Is the only actor to win a Best Actor Oscar when nominated alongside four previous Oscar winners.
      In 2003, at the age of 29, he replaced Richard Dreyfuss as the youngest actor ever to win the Best Actor Academy Award, for his role in The Pianist (2002).
      Has great appreciation for hip-hop music. Like the Beatnuts, one of his favorite groups, Brody is also from Queens.
      Adrien's father, Elliot Brody, is a retired history teacher; Elliot is of Polish Jewish descent, and lost family members in the Holocaust. Adrien's mother, Sylvia Plachy, the renowned photographer, fled Communist Hungary as a child during the 1956 revolution against Russia. Adrien's maternal grandfather was from an aristocratic Hungarian background, while Adrien's maternal grandmother was of Czech Jewish descent. Adrien's mother was not aware of her own mother's Jewish background until later in life.
      In 1992, he was seriously hurt in a motorcycle accident in which he flew over a car and crashed feet-first into a crosswalk. He spent months recuperating.
      To prepare for his title role in The Pianist (2002), he learned to play Frédéric Chopin pieces on the piano and shed 30 pounds off his already-thin frame. He cut himself off from his real life by giving up his car and apartment because he felt responsible to those Polish Jews who had suffered greatly and wanted to connect, to some small degree, with their hurt and despair.
      Admits a shot of his parents in a passionate, back-bending embrace inspired his famous kiss with Halle Berry at the Oscars in 2003.
      Has been compared to Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for his unconventional acting skills and unique looks.
      Did sessions in an isolation tank, performed prison exercises, and went on a protein diet for his role in The Jacket (2005).
      He was furious when his nose was broken during the final fight in Summer of Sam (1999). When he had it fixed, he didn't change it: his nose is one of his most distinctive features and sets him apart from other actors.
      Was friends with the late Tupac Shakur, with whom he starred in the little-known film Bullet (1996).
      He signed on to make Bread and Roses (2000) without a script because he trusted the director Ken Loach. Prior to filming, he also went undercover to research life as a union member in Los Angeles, California. He went to conventions and sat in on strike talks. A couple of the members recognized him, but Brody persuaded them not to blow his cover.
      Was engaged to Elsa Pataky, having been in a relationship with her since June 2006 after meeting on the set of Manolete (2008) (April 2008-May 2009).
      Fought hard to convince producer Robert Rodriguez and director Nimród Antal that he was a good choice for the lead role of "Royce" in Predators (2010).
      He attended a charity auction in November 2011 for Artists for Peace & Justice, which was offering "Tea with Gerard Butler" as a bidding item; it was a chance to meet and chat with Butler. Brody's $15,000 bid was the winner. On a whim, Brody offered to host "Champagne with Adrien Brody" as a last-minute addition to the auction, if it could take place later that day; he had a bottle available. Brody's offer was accepted, and it earned an additional $17,000 for the charity.

      Attended the 2006 MTV European Music Awards in Copenhagen, Denmark on November 2nd. [November 2006]

      He, Marisa Tomei, Russell Crowe and Marcia Gay Harden are the only actors to win an Oscar without being awarded for the same performance in none of its predecessor awards (Golden Globe, Critics Choice Awards, SAG and BAFTA). Marisa Tomei and Marcia Gay Harden were not even nominated for those awards for their performances in My Cousin Vinny (1992) and Pollock (2000), and Crowe's only award for Gladiator (2000) before the Oscar was the Critics Choice award.
      He and Marion Cotillard are the only actors to win both a César and an Oscar for the same performance. Brody won both awards in 2003 for The Pianist (2002) and Cotillard won in 2008 for La môme (2007).
      [Referring to his portrayal of Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who survived the Holocaust, in The Pianist (2002)] It made me have a much greater understanding of loss, of loneliness, and the level of intense tragedy that so many people have experienced in this world, I take a lot less for granted. It's really valuable to gain that, especially at a young age.
      [on his role as the village idiot in The Village (2004)] It just felt like it was the unconventional choice. It was the kind of role that I would have taken prior to the Academy Awards. A lot of actors tend to wait for the perfect role. And that perfect role may never come. I don't want to start changing the way that I view things and become precious.
      I was a wild, mischievous kid and I had tremendous imagination. Any experience I had, I'd try to reenact it. I always had an actor within me.
      I think to be a well-rounded person, you have to experience good and bad, wonderful moments and pain. You need to meet people who have no exposure to kindness, who lack any opportunity and have no way out--like the homeless, the mentally ill--and you've got to learn empathy for them.
      [on working on Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005)] I'm running around in front of a green screen screaming, "Where's the monkey? Where's the monkey?"
      [on his role as Jack in Love the Hard Way (2001)] I identified a lot with that character, I was exorcising the demons that I'd has as a hoody kid in Queens, where you hold your own or wither. So my character out-hustled the hustle.
      My dad told me, "It takes fifteen years to be an overnight success", and it took me seventeen and a half years.
      [on giving up material possessions and shedding 30 pounds for The Pianist (2002)] There's no comparison to what Wladyslaw Szpilman went through and the suffering that people during the Holocaust, or nations afflicted with famine are going through, but it gave me a much greater understanding of that. And you can't act that. I take the work very seriously.
      [on working with Roman Polanski on The Pianist (2002)] We were shooting a scene and he's like, "Adrien, I need you to climb up the building. And I want you to go up to the roof and I want you to climb out the window. And I want you to hang and they're going to shoot at you. And I want you to slide off the building and hold on to the gutter and then you're going to fall". And I said, "Has anyone tried this before?" And he said, "Hollywood actors! Come on, I show you, I show you." And he runs up the building, sixty-eight years old, climbs out the window and hangs from the window, slides down the roof of the building, hangs from the gutter, jumps down to the ground, brushes himself off and he said, "There, somebody did it. Now do it".
      [on proclaiming himself a magician at age five] I was an amazing Adrien. I may still be at times. In retrospect, I see that was my first performance. And you know a lot about magic is not just the trick, it's the pattern. It's the delivery. It's the presentation. And this is why you're going to be amazed.
      [on Roman Polanski] He wasn't easy on me, ever. He wasn't particularly kind to me, but he wasn't -- he was never disrespectful regarding the work. I grew. I'm stronger, I'm tougher from Roman. I'm tougher. I'm not harder, I'm just tougher.
      [on winning the Academy Award for Best Actor] It's interesting, winning an Academy Award as a young man . . . life-changing, but I'm just me within that. It's been very helpful for my career, but I'm trying to stay on the path I was on before.
      [on being strapped in a straitjacket and thrown in a body drawer for The Jacket (2005)] Those situations are very challenging, emotionally and psychologically, to find yourself in a confined space like that. I thought it would be interesting. It was very painful and I kind of encouraged that pain. I spent time in an isolation tank -- lots of time -- and I would let them leave me in the jacket and leave me in the drawer for a while.
      I'm not the kind of person to deliberately behave differently for the sake of behaving differently, but there are certain things that you have to kind of be true to and sacrifice your own freedom at that time to do.
      I've never taken a role for money. I felt it would be wrong - not necessarily a career decision - just wrong.
      [on playing hero Jack Driscoll in Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005)] I've always wanted to do something like King Kong. It's a phenomenal role that any actor would kill for. I've been looking for this kind of iconic leading man guy for years, but they are hard to find.
      They compare me to Al Pacino -- I admire and appreciate the comparison. But, really, I'd rather be thought of as "the first Adrien Brody," than "the new Al Pacino".
      [on growing up in Queens, New York] I hung out with troublemakers. I was a sensitive teenage boy, who luckily had kind parents, but I lived in a not-so-kind neighborhood. In order to deal with it, I toughened up and became more of a hoodier kid. It was never malicious, that's not in my nature, but I was much harder than I am today. Had I not had parents I could talk to, it would have got out of hand.
      [on being enrolled into acting classes by his parents when he was a teen] I liked it instantly. Aside from being one of only three boys in a class of 20 girls - the odds were fantastic - I felt I was good at it, it was creative. I had been encouraged by my parents to be outspoken and free, so I was pretty much disinhibited. It was a good outlet for me.
      [on his role in The Thin Red Line (1998) being cut down from lead character to bit part] It kind of felt like a soldier coming home after giving his soul and then not being appreciated. At 24, it sucked; it was embarrassing because I would assume if an actor was cut out of a movie of that nature with a director of that caliber it must be as a result of a flaw in the actor's work. Not as a result of a director changing his vision. But you pick yourself up. The advantage of being a bigger name is it costs them too much money to cut you out of a movie.
      I suppose that means I'm not easy to define. But that's good, isn't it? In this town they love to define you to death.
      Everything is harder than you would imagine, including success. You might think it's lovely to be famous, but if your process is to constantly observe people and human behavior and yet everyone is observing you all the time, how do you do what you do? I never saw that coming as an obstacle.
      I don't think anyone saw me as the heroic leading man before I won an Oscar. I'm not sure anyone does now, outside of Peter Jackson.
      I would have loved to make a lot of money as an actor. I would have loved to not live in a shitty little apartment for most of the time I've been in Los Angeles. I would have loved to have nice things and bought new cars, but it's painful for me to do a bad role. Personally painful. You feel like you're lying to everybody. It's just not worth it.
      I grew up without a lot of money and my parents grew up with far less money. And that's kept me in line. Really in line.
      You get a little fame as an actor and suddenly people ask your opinion on world politics and why we're in Iraq. Why is my opinion any more valid than anyone else's? My opinion doesn't count more just because I'm famous now.
      [on motorcycling in India] I almost died. I jammed on the brakes, skidded and nearly slammed into it. I was laughing, thinking, "This is the way I'll be remembered: rear-ending a cow".
      What guides me is to do work that's more avant-garde - things that I think are special. You can easily become a celebrity and get caught up in all that blur. I just want to work and surprise myself.
      [In 2010, regarding fame after The Pianist (2002)] Even though I've had plenty of ups and downs, I didn't have the maturity and the sense of self-awareness to have gotten me through it as positively as I did if I had been in my early twenties. A five-year difference would have had a big impact. Because you have a tremendous amount of attention: All the girls think you're beautiful all of a sudden, and people wanna be your friends - and they genuinely wanna be your friend. I don't feel that it's insincere. You now emanate some sort of light that you didn't have before, and it's created, but it's too much. Even tons of positive energy on one person is still energy, and that does something. There're repercussions for that kind of energy. It's a lot of forces coming right at you, and that's tumultuous for any young person.
      [In 2010, on his career] I work when I want to work. I don't feel the pressure that I used to feel as an actor that I may not have an opportunity to work, that I will not find gainful employment with something that inspires me, that I might have to take work just for the sake of working. I feel honestly so fortunate to have that.
      [In 2010, on acting] I was always an actor - not in a way that people might presume actors to be, 'cause I believe there's a presumption that they like attention all the time, and that they're very outgoing. Acting is perhaps misunderstood. I'm a relatively shy person. I often liken it to my mother's approach as an artist, because she's a photographer and she sees so much in a situation that very few people might see. She'll see so much happening beneath the surface with an imagery that says something else. And I have a fascination with a similar kind of thing where I see details in people's mannerisms, or beneath something that's said to someone else. All these things that lay beneath the surface and things that are really special and that make us all so unique. Growing up in New York, I encountered so many different kinds of people everywhere. I went to the School of Performing Arts, but I feel like my real acting training came from going to and from school on four different trains each way, because of how many human beings I've encountered, between homeless people and immigrant workers and shark businessmen and every kind of human being - every kind of human being every other step. My natural fascination was that I gravitated toward their mannerisms - not to use as an actor, just because I'm curious, I guess. And rather than capture the image with photography, I feel like I capture it somehow and remember details very specifically, and I retain things very easily and evoke them later.
      [In 2010, on acting] An actor has a responsibility [to be] connected and present and able to be very malleable and exist in a space that isn't his or her own on set, and when they're working. I'm not able to fully engage with you when I'm working on a set. I couldn't do an interview justice because it's impossible for me to separate from myself, and then to engage as myself, and then go back to [that character]. So then my producer who needs that interview might say, "Oh, he's being pretentious." But it's detrimental to my process of being truthful [to the character], nothing more. Sometimes I am very gregarious and outgoing, and sometimes I'm not. I'm relatively introverted, and I'll stay by myself; but they'll misinterpret what that is.
      [in 2010] The reality is that, for me, acting is somewhat of a painful process. A beautiful process, but a painful one. The more I have to do battle to find truth, the more painful it is if I don't, because film is permanent. So it's important the work I choose is something I can have that confidence in. Otherwise, a movie becomes a permanent reminder of a mistake you made.
      [i 2010, on losing or gaining weight for a role] It's exciting when you physically change, when you change your body chemistry and you feel a transformation, it helps you feel a connection to the character. You feel different from yourself. It's another level of involvement.
      [in 2010, on adding muscle for Predators (2010)] Putting on weight obviously is more enjoyable, though I was trying to put on lean muscle. So they're both very strict diets. But one diet builds confidence and the other strips it away. The diets are similar, but with volumes more food when you're building muscle. I have a fast metabolism so I had to gain mass and then shred it. I started with heavy weights to put on size; then I did higher repetitions with smaller weights to give the muscles definition. No carbs and I did a workout with more cardio.
      [on his first role in Home at Last (1988), when he was 14] I was in high school and I went off to Nebraska by myself and I loved it. I was playing an orphan from the 1800s and I went wild. I hung out with the wranglers' sons and was riding horses and chewing tobacco and having amazing experiences. I remember when it was over, the director kiddingly said that they were going to turn it into a series. I was ready, I didn't want the experience to end.
      [in 2010, on doing a film for the paycheck] Everybody has a price, I'm sure. Often times the jobs you'll be well-compensated for are that way for a reason. The roles that speak to you usually don't have resounding success, or even compensate you fairly. There is a balance you try to strike. Really, if I wasn't an actor, I don't know what the alternative would be. I'm glad I don't have to face that.
      [on Detachment (2011)] That's a movie that we all made for the right reasons and no one saw. That is upsetting. It was a wonderful role, and in playing that character it made me think a lot about our children's future and how frightening it is, and what they're up against.
      [on fame] It's made the world a much smaller place. I was lost, hiking in New Zealand and these two girls literally picked me up and drove me home. There was nothing weird, there was no agenda, nobody asked for anybody's number, not even a photograph, but they recognised me and they felt safe to put me in their car - a complete stranger from New York, a grown man. The reason that resonated with me is that here, on the opposite side of the world, complete strangers kind of took me in.

If only the advertisers had fought as hard to be worthy of the Super Bowl hype.In recent years, the cliché of saying "I only watch for the ads" has been supplanted by a new Super Bowl truism: The game on the field somehow upstaged the jousting from Madison Avenue. Even this year's most memorable and charming ad — a bit of wordless magic involving a child in a Darth Vader outfit tricked into thinking he had self-started the family Volkswagen — stole some of its own thunder by being leaked and disseminated online days before Sunday's showcase. For Volkswagen, this extra exposure is likely considered a win. It's the sort of ad you're happy to watch and re-watch — and online it even runs longer. But the surprise factor was gone by Sunday night, robbing the ad of its "event" status...read moreSuper Bowl XLV: Darth Vader, Eminem and the Perils of "Reply All"Feb 6, 2011 09:08 PM ETby Kate StanhopeDarth Vader used "The Force" to power Volkswagen. A claymation version of Eminem shilled Chrysler and Lipton Brisk Iced Tea. And a poor employee unnecessarily put his tires to the test because of "reply all."
Off the field, game day was dominated by celebrities ranging from 16-year-old pop singer Justin Bieber to a confused Ozzy Osbourne, who teamed up for a Best Buy spot. "What's a Bieber?" Ozzy asked wife Sharon.
Eminem appeared in two very different Super Bowl commercials — a comedic spot for Lipton Brisk Iced Tea, and a more serious one for Chrysler, dedicated to the company and rapper's hometown of Detroit. The commercial helped boost...read more

Adrien Brody stars as Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher who conveniently avoids any emotional connections by never staying anywhere long enough to form a bond with either his students or colleagues. A lost soul grappling with a troubled past, Henry finds himself at a public school where an apathetic student body has created a frustrated, burned-out administration. Inadvertently becoming a role model to his students, while also bonding with a runaway teen who is just as lost as he is, Henry finds that he’s not alone in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.

But with the student body getting higher and higher with every brownie, and a pissed-off Psycho Ed on their tails for stealing his stash, they must find a way to keep their half-baked plan from going up in smoke.

Ok, I'll cut my usual critique and go right to begging! Well, maybe a little critique...but mostly pure, unapologetic begging.We're down to five and, as I see it, there are only two clear cut choices for the winner: my Helio and Mel B. If you don't agree I defy you to prove why your choice deserves to win. They are by far the best and most exciting. So this is my plea  let's keep these two safe! Get out there and vote.Don't get me wrong, I am a big Jennie Garth fan, but her performances tonight were a bit shaky and it makes me wonder whether she'd be able to handle the pressure of the finale. I definitely think she deserves a spot next week in the semi and if she gets better I think she should be the third spot for the finals.Cameron will be the one to go tomorrow night and I say that because I don't believe that Marie Osmond will actually lose.

So what's it really like trying to produce an indie film on a shoestring budget, with underqualified/overinflated ego-wielding actors, frustrated writer-directors and a crazy, Japanese-spouting investor? The Business, premiering Friday, Aug. 4, at 11:30 pm/ET, picked up where IFC's The Festival left off, as writer-director Rufus Marquez (Nicholas Wright) struggles to get his low-budget thriller made by wannabe-legit smut-peddler Vic Morgenstein (Rob DeLeeuw). Hopefully saving everyone's bacon in this mess is Kathleen Robertson's Julia Sullivan, who quits her job at (wink-wink) IFC to give Vic a desperately needed assist.
