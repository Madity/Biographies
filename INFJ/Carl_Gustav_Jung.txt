Carl Gustav Jung (/jʊŋ/; German: [ˈkarl ˈɡʊstaf jʊŋ]; 26 July 1875 – 6 June 1961), often referred to as C. G. Jung, was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychotherapist who founded analytical psychology.[2] Jung proposed and developed the concepts of extraversion and introversion; archetypes, and the collective unconscious. His work has been influential in psychiatry and in the study of religion, philosophy, archeology, anthropology, literature, and related fields. He was a prolific writer, many of whose works were not published until after his death.
The central concept of analytical psychology is individuation—the psychological process of integrating the opposites, including the conscious with the unconscious, while still maintaining their relative autonomy.[3] Jung considered individuation to be the central process of human development.[4]
Jung created some of the best known psychological concepts, including the archetype, the collective unconscious, the complex, and synchronicity. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular psychometric instrument, has been developed from Jung's theory of psychological types.
Jung saw the human psyche as "by nature religious"[5] and made this religiousness the focus of his explorations.[6] Jung is one of the best known contemporary contributors to dream analysis and symbolization.
Though he was a practising clinician and considered himself to be a scientist,[7] much of his life's work was spent exploring tangential areas such as Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, and sociology, as well as literature and the arts. Jung's interest in philosophy and the occult led many to view him as a mystic, although his ambition was to be seen as a man of science.[7] His influence on popular psychology, the "psychologization of religion",[8] spirituality and the New Age movement has been immense.[9]
Carl Gustav Jung[a] was born in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, on 26 July 1875 as the fourth but only surviving child of Paul Achilles Jung and Emilie Preiswerk. Emilie Preiswerk was the youngest child of Samuel Preiswerk who was also Paul Achilles Jung's professor of Hebrew. Jung's father was a poor rural pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church while his mother came from a wealthy Swiss family.
When Jung was six months old his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in Laufen. Meanwhile the tension between his parents was growing. Emilie Jung was an eccentric and depressed woman who spent much of her time in her own separate bedroom enthralled by the spirits that she said visited her at night.[10] Jung had a better relationship with his father due to his mother's eccentricities. Although normal during the day, Jung said that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. Jung said that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body.[10]
Jung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel for an unknown physical ailment. Jung was taken by his father to live with Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel but was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and often depressed mood influenced her son's attitude towards women — one of "innate unreliability".[11] This was a view that he later called the "handicap I started off with"[12] and that resulted in his sometimes patriarchal views of women.[13] After three years of living in Laufen Paul Jung requested a transfer and was called to Kleinhüningen in 1879. The relocation brought Emilie Jung in closer contact to her family and lifted her melancholy and despondent mood.
Jung was a solitary and introverted child and was convinced from childhood that, like his mother,[14] he had two personalities—a modern Swiss citizen and a personality more suited to the nineteenth century.[15] "Personality Number 1," as he termed it, was a typical schoolboy living in the era of the time. "Personality Number 2" was a dignified, authoritative and influential man from the past. Although Jung was close to both parents he was disappointed by his father's academic approach to faith.
A number of childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy he carved a tiny mannequin into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He then added a stone which he had painted into upper and lower halves and hid the case in the attic. Periodically he would come back to the mannequin often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language.[16] He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later he discovered similarities between this personal experience and the totems of native peoples such as the collection of soul-stones near Arlesheim or the tjurungas of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual that was practiced in a strikingly similar way in faraway locations that he, as a young boy, had no way of consciously knowing about.[17] His findings on psychological archetypes and the collective unconscious were inspired, in part, by these experiences.
At the age of twelve, and shortly before the end of his first year at the Humanistisches Gymnasium in Basel, he was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he was momentarily unconscious (Jung later recognized that the incident was his fault, indirectly). A thought then came to him—"now you won't have to go to school any more."[18] From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking worriedly to a visitor of his future ability to support himself. They suspected he had epilepsy. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty he realized the need for academic excellence. He immediately went into his father's study and began poring over Latin grammar. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, "was when I learned what a neurosis is."[19]
Jung did not plan to study psychiatry since it was not considered prestigious at the time. But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he discovered that psychoses are personality diseases. His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual and was exactly what he was searching for.[20]
In 1895 Jung studied medicine at the University of Basel. In 1900 he began working in the Zurich psychiatric hospital Burghölzli with Eugen Bleuler. His dissertation, published in 1903, was titled "On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena." In 1906 he published Studies in Word Association and later sent a copy of this book to Sigmund Freud which led to a close six year friendship between them (see section on Relationship with Freud). In 1912 Jung published Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (known in English as Psychology of the Unconscious) which resulted in a theoretical divergence between himself and Freud. Consequently their friendship fractured—each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong. After this falling-out Jung went through a pivotal and difficult psychological transformation which was exacerbated by news of the First World War. Henri Ellenberger called Jung's experience a "creative illness" and compared it to Freud's period of, what he called, neurasthenia and hysteria.
During World War I Jung was drafted as an army doctor and soon made Commandant of an internment camp for British officers and soldiers (Swiss neutrality obliged the Swiss to intern personnel from either side of the conflict who crossed their frontier to evade capture). Jung worked to improve the conditions of soldiers stranded in neutral territory and encouraged them to attend university courses.[21]
In 1903 Jung married Emma Rauschenbach who came from a wealthy family in Switzerland. They had five children: Agathe, Gret, Franz, Marianne, and Helene. The marriage lasted until Emma's death in 1955 but Jung engaged in open relationships with other women. His extramarital relationships with patients and friends Sabina Spielrein[22] and Toni Wolff[23] were the most widely known.
Jung was thirty when he sent his Studies in Word Association to Sigmund Freud in Vienna in 1906. The two men met for the first time the following year and Jung recalled the discussion between himself and Freud as interminable. He recalled that they talked almost unceasingly for thirteen hours.[24] Six months later the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection of his latest published essays to Jung in Zurich. This marked the beginning of an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted six years and ended in May 1913.[citation needed] At this time Jung resigned as the chairman of the International Psychoanalytical Association where he had been elected with Freud's support.
Jung and Freud influenced each other during the intellectually formative years of Jung's life. Freud called Jung "his adopted eldest son, his crown prince and successor". As Freud was already fifty years old at their meeting, he was well beyond the formative years. In 1906 psychology as a science was still in its early stages. Jung, who had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading Psychopathia Sexualis by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, professor in Vienna, now worked as a doctor under the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in Burghölzli and became familiar with Freud's idea of the unconscious through Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams (1899) and was a proponent of the new "psycho-analysis." At the time, Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burghölzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich at which Jung was a young doctor whose research had already given him international recognition.
Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of unconscious that contains memories and ideas inherited from our ancestors. While he did think that libido was an important source for personal growth, he, unlike Freud, believed that libido alone was not responsible for the formation of the core personality.[25]
In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research. The following year, Jung traveled with Freud and Sándor Ferenczi to the United States to speak about psychoanalysis and, in 1910, Jung became Chairman for Life of the International Psychoanalytical Association. While Jung worked on his Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung, mostly due to their disagreements over the nature of libido and religion.[clarification needed] In 1912 these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague Ludwig Binswanger in Kreuzlingen without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as "the Kreuzlingen gesture". Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the United States and gave the Fordham lectures, which were published as The Theory of Psychoanalysis in 1912. While they contain some remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the nature of libido, they represent largely a "psychoanalytical Jung" and not the theory Jung became famous for in the following decades.

In 1909 Jung and Freud traveled to the conference at Clark University. The event was planned by psychologist G. Stanley Hall and included twenty-seven distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America. This forged welcome links between Jung and influential Americans.[26] Jung returned to the United States the next year for a brief visit, and again for a six-week lecture series at Fordham University in 1912.
In November 1912, Jung and Freud met in Munich for a meeting among prominent colleagues to discuss psychoanalytical journals.[27] At a talk about a new psychoanalytic essay on Amenhotep IV, Jung expressed his views on how it related to actual conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement. While Jung spoke, Freud suddenly fainted and Jung carried him to a couch.
Jung and Freud personally met for the last time in September 1913 for the Fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress in Munich. Jung gave a talk on psychological types, the introverted and extraverted type in analytical psychology. This constituted the introduction of some of the key concepts which came to distinguish Jung's work from Freud's in the next half century.
Jung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914. His travels were soon interrupted by the war, but his ideas continued to receive attention in England primarily through the efforts of Constance Long. He translated and published the first English volume of his collected writings.[28]
In 1913, at the age of thirty-eight, Jung experienced a horrible "confrontation with the unconscious". He saw visions and heard voices. He worried at times that he was "menaced by a psychosis" or was "doing a schizophrenia". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, "active imaginations". He recorded everything he felt in small journals. Jung began to transcribe his notes into a large red leather-bound book, on which he worked intermittently for sixteen years.[13]
Jung left no posthumous instructions about the final disposition of what he called the "Red Book". His family eventually moved it into a bank vault in 1984. Sonu Shamdasani, a historian from London, for three years tried to persuade Jung's heirs to have it published, to which they declined every hint of inquiry. As of mid-September 2009, fewer than two dozen people had seen it. Ulrich Hoerni, Jung's grandson who manages the Jung archives, decided to publish it. To raise the additional funds needed the Philemon Foundation was founded.[13]
In 2007, two technicians for DigitalFusion, working with the publisher, W. W. Norton & Company, painstakingly scanned one-tenth of a millimeter at a time with a 10,200-pixel scanner. It was published on 7 October 2009, in German with "separate English translation along with Shamdasani's introduction and footnotes" at the back of the book, according to Sara Corbett for The New York Times. She wrote, "The book is bombastic, baroque and like so much else about Carl Jung, a willful oddity, synched with an antediluvian and mystical reality."[13]
The Rubin Museum of Art in New York City displayed the original Red Book journal, as well as some of Jung's original small journals, from 7 October 2009, to 25 January 2010.[29] According to them, "During the period in which he worked on this book Jung developed his principal theories of archetypes, collective unconscious, and the process of individuation." Two-thirds of the pages bear Jung's illuminations of the text.[29]
In the following years Jung experienced considerable isolation in his professional life, exacerbated through World War I. His Seven Sermons to the Dead (1917), reprinted in his autobiography Memories, Dreams, Reflections, can also be read as expression of the psychological conflicts which beset Jung around the age of forty after the break with Freud.
Constance Long arranged for him to deliver a seminar in Cornwall in 1920. Another seminar was held in 1923, this one organized by Helton Godwin Baynes (known as Peter), and another in 1925.[30]
Jung made a more extensive trip westward in the winter of 1924–5, financed and organized by Fowler McCormick and George Porter. Of particular value to Jung was a visit with Chief Mountain Lake of the Taos Pueblo near Taos, New Mexico.[30]
In October 1925, Jung embarked on his most ambitious expedition, the "Bugishu Psychological Expedition" to East Africa. He was accompanied by Peter Baynes and an American associate, George Beckwith. On the voyage to Africa, they became acquainted with an English woman named Ruth Bailey, who joined their safari a few weeks later. The group traveled through Kenya and Uganda to the slopes of Mount Elgon, where Jung hoped to increase his understanding of "primitive psychology" through conversations with the culturally isolated residents of that area. Later he concluded that the major insights he had gleaned had to do with himself and the European psychology in which he had been raised.[31][32][full citation needed]
Jung made another trip to America in 1936, giving lectures in New York and New England for his growing group of American followers. He returned in 1937 to deliver the Terry Lectures, later published as Psychology and Religion, at Yale University.
In December 1937, Jung left Zurich again for an extensive tour of India with Fowler McCormick. In India, he felt himself "under the direct influence of a foreign culture" for the first time. In Africa, his conversations had been strictly limited by the language barrier, but in India he was able to converse extensively. Hindu philosophy became an important element in his understanding of the role of symbolism and the life of the unconscious, though he avoided a meeting with Ramana Maharshi. He described Ramana as being absorbed in ‘the self’, but admits to not understanding Ramana’s self-realisation or what he actually did do. He also admits that his field of psychology is not competent in understanding the eastern insight of the atman ‘the self’. Jung became seriously ill on this trip and endured two weeks of delirium in a Calcutta hospital. After 1938, his travels were confined to Europe.[33]
Jung continued to publish books until the end of his life, including Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies (1959), which analyzed the archetypal meaning and possible psychological significance of the reported observations of UFOs.[34] He also enjoyed a friendship with an English Roman Catholic priest, Father Victor White, who corresponded with Jung after he had published his controversial Answer to Job.[35]
The concept of introversion and extraversion (although he did not define these terms as they are popularly defined today).[38]
Synchronicity as a mode of relationship that is not causal, an idea that has influenced Wolfgang Pauli (with whom he developed the notion of unus mundus in connection with the notion of non-locality) and some other physicists.[39]
In Jung’s Psychological Types, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extrovert. These two psychological types Jung compares to the ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus.
The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometime be disinterested in joining the activities of others.
The extrovert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extrovert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits.[40]
Jung's primary disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious.[citation needed] Jung saw Freud's theory of the unconscious as incomplete and unnecessarily negative. According to Jung, Freud conceived the unconscious solely as a repository of repressed emotions and desires. Jung agreed with Freud's model of the unconscious, what Jung called the "personal unconscious", but he also proposed the existence of a second, far deeper form of the unconscious underlying the personal one. This was the collective unconscious, where the archetypes themselves resided, represented in mythology by a lake or other body of water, and in some cases a jug or other container. Freud had actually mentioned a collective level of psychic functioning but saw it primarily as an appendix to the rest of the psyche.
Jung considered individuation, a psychological process of integrating the opposites including the conscious with the unconscious while still maintaining their relative autonomy, necessary for a person to become whole.[4]
Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and collective unconscious is brought into consciousness (by means of dreams, active imagination or free association to take some examples) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche to take place.[41]
Besides achieving physical and mental health,[41] people who have advanced towards individuation tend to be harmonious, mature and responsible. They embody humane values such as freedom and justice and have a good understanding about the workings of human nature and the universe.[4]
In his psychological theory – which is not necessarily linked to a particular theory of social structure – the persona appears as a consciously created personality or identity fashioned out of part of the collective psyche through socialization, acculturation and experience.[42] Jung applied the classical term persona, explicitly because, originally, it meant the mask which the actor bears, expressing the role he plays (see also persona (psychology)).
The persona, he argues, is a mask for the "collective psyche", a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played role through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the "persona-mask" as a complicated system which mediates between individual consciousness and the social community: it is "a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be".[43] But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a character mask in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression to others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.[44] The therapist then aims to assist the individuation process through which the client (re-)gains his "own self" – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the persona, and from the power of unconscious impulses.
Jung's theory has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate "management persona" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,[45] but also because they have to evaluate what sort of people the workers are, in order to manage them (for example, using personality tests and peer reviews).[46]
Jung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals. Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep innate potential. Based on his study of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, Taoism, and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called individuation, is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the self and at the same time to meet the Divine. Unlike Freud's objectivist worldview, Jung's pantheism may have led him to believe that spiritual experience was essential to our well-being, as he specifically identifies individual human life with the universe as a whole.[47][48] Jung's ideas on religion gave a counterbalance to the Freudian scepticism on religion. Jung's idea of religion as a practical road to individuation has been quite popular, and is still treated in modern textbooks on the psychology of religion, though his ideas have also been criticized.[49]
In 1944 Jung published Psychology and Alchemy, where he analyzed the alchemical symbols and showed a direct relationship to the psychoanalytical process.[b] He argued that the alchemical process was the transformation of the impure soul (lead) to perfected soul (gold), and a metaphor for the individuation process.[20]
In 1963 Mysterium Coniunctionis was first published in The Collected Works of C. G. Jung. Mysterium Coniunctionis was Jung's last book and focused on the "Mysterium Coniunctionis" archetype, known as the sacred marriage between sun and moon. Jung argued that the stages of the alchemists, the blackening, the whitening, the reddening and the yellowing, could be taken as symbolic of individuation — his favourite term for personal growth (75).
Jung recommended spirituality as a cure for alcoholism and he is considered to have had an indirect role in establishing Alcoholics Anonymous.[50] Jung once treated an American patient (Rowland Hazard III), suffering from chronic alcoholism. After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that occasionally such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics where all else had failed.
Hazard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a First-Century Christian evangelical movement known as the Oxford Group (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was Ebby Thacher, a long-time friend and drinking buddy of Bill Wilson, later co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group, and through them Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original twelve-step program, and from there into the whole twelve-step recovery movement, although AA as a whole is not Jungian and Jung had no role in the formation of that approach or the twelve steps.
The above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill W. (i.e., Bill Wilson), excerpts of which can be found in Pass It On, published by Alcoholics Anonymous.[51] Although the detail of this story is disputed by some historians, Jung himself discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks given around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in Volume 18 of his Collected Works, The Symbolic Life ("For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, 'You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group. I can't do it better than Jesus.'" Jung goes on to state that he has seen similar cures among Roman Catholics).[52]
Jung proposed that art can be used to alleviate or contain feelings of trauma, fear, or anxiety and also to repair, restore and heal.[16] In his work with patients and in his own personal explorations, Jung wrote that art expression and images found in dreams could be helpful in recovering from trauma and emotional distress. He often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions at times of emotional distress, which he recognized as more than recreational.[16]
Jung stressed the importance of individual rights in a person's relation to the state and society. He saw that the state was treated as "a quasi-animate personality from whom everything is expected" but that this personality was "only camouflage for those individuals who know how to manipulate it",[53] and referred to the state as a form of slavery.[54][55][56][57] He also thought that the state "swallowed up [people's] religious forces",[58] and therefore that the state had "taken the place of God"—making it comparable to a religion in which "state slavery is a form of worship".[56] Jung observed that "stage acts of [the] state" are comparable to religious displays: "Brass bands, flags, banners, parades and monster demonstrations are no different in principle from ecclesiastical processions, cannonades and fire to scare off demons".[59] From Jung's perspective, this replacement of God with the state in a mass society led to the dislocation of the religious drive and resulted in the same fanaticism of the church-states of the Dark Ages—wherein the more the state is 'worshipped', the more freedom and morality are suppressed;[60] this ultimately leaves the individual psychically undeveloped with extreme feelings of marginalization.[61]
Jung had many friends and respected colleagues who were Jewish and he maintained relations with them through the 1930s when anti-semitism in Germany and other European nations was on the rise. However, until 1939, he also maintained professional relations with psychotherapists in Germany who had declared their support for the Nazi regime and there were allegations that he himself was a Nazi sympathizer. In his work Civilisation in Transition, Collected Works Volume X, however, Jung wrote of "... the Aryan bird of prey with his insatiable lust to lord it in every land, even those that concern him not at all."[62]
In 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung took part in restructuring of the General Medical Society for Psychotherapy (Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie), a German-based professional body with an international membership. The society was reorganized into two distinct bodies:
A strictly German body, the Deutsche Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie, led by Matthias Göring, an Adlerian psychotherapist[63] and a cousin of the prominent Nazi Hermann Göring;
International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, led by Jung. The German body was to be affiliated to the international society, as were new national societies being set up in Switzerland and elsewhere.[64]
The International Society's constitution permitted individual doctors to join it directly, rather than through one of the national affiliated societies, a provision to which Jung drew attention in a circular in 1934.[65] This implied that German Jewish doctors could maintain their professional status as individual members of the international body, even though they were excluded from the German affiliate, as well as from other German medical societies operating under the Nazis.[66]
As leader of the international body, Jung assumed overall responsibility for its publication, the Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie. In 1933, this journal published a statement endorsing Nazi positions[67] and Hitler's book Mein Kampf.[68] In 1934, Jung wrote in a Swiss publication, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, that he experienced "great surprise and disappointment"[69] when the Zentralblatt associated his name with the pro-Nazi statement.
Jung went on to say "the main point is to get a young and insecure science into a place of safety during an earthquake".[70] He did not end his relationship with the Zentralblatt at this time, but he did arrange the appointment of a new managing editor, Carl Alfred Meier of Switzerland. For the next few years, the Zentralblatt under Jung and Meier maintained a position distinct from that of the Nazis, in that it continued to acknowledge contributions of Jewish doctors to psychotherapy.[71]
In the face of energetic German attempts to Nazify the international body, Jung resigned from its presidency in 1939,[71] the year the Second World War started.
Jung's interest in European mythology and folk psychology has led to accusations of Nazi sympathies, since they shared the same interest.[72][73][74] He became, however, aware of the negative impact of these similarities:
Jung clearly identifies himself with the spirit of German Volkstumsbewegung throughout this period and well into the 1920s and 1930s, until the horrors of Nazism finally compelled him to reframe these neopagan metaphors in a negative light in his 1936 essay on Wotan.[75]
There are writings showing that Jung's sympathies were against, rather than for, Nazism.[c] In his 1936 essay "Wotan", Jung described the influence of Hitler on Germany as "one man who is obviously 'possessed' has infected a whole nation to such an extent that everything is set in motion and has started rolling on its course towards perdition."[76][77] and wrote
...  But what a so-called Führer does with a mass movement can plainly be seen if we turn our eyes to the north or south of our country.[78]
Hitler seemed like the 'double' of a real person, as if Hitler the man might be hiding inside like an appendix, and deliberately so concealed in order not to disturb the mechanism ... You know you could never talk to this man; because there is nobody there ... It is not an individual; it is an entire nation.[79]
In an interview with Carol Baumann in 1948, Jung denied rumors regarding any sympathy for the Nazi movement, saying:
It must be clear to anyone who has read any of my books that I have never been a Nazi sympathizer and I never have been anti-Semitic, and no amount of misquotation, mistranslation, or rearrangement of what I have written can alter the record of my true point of view. Nearly every one of these passages has been tampered with, either by malice or by ignorance. Furthermore, my friendly relations with a large group of Jewish colleagues and patients over a period of many years in itself disproves the charge of anti-Semitism.[80][d]
Laurens van der Post, afrikaner author who claimed to have had a 16-year-long friendship with Jung, from which a number of books and a film were created about Jung's life.[81] The accuracy of van der Post's claims about the closeness of his relationship to Jung have been questioned.[27]
Hermann Hesse, author of works such as Siddhartha and Steppenwolf, was treated by Joseph Lang, a student of Jung. For Hesse this began a long preoccupation with psychoanalysis, through which he came to know Jung personally.[82]
Original statue of Jung in Mathew Street, Liverpool, a half-body on a plinth captioned "Liverpool is the pool of life"
The visionary Swiss painter Peter Birkhäuser was treated by a student of Jung, Marie-Louise von Franz, and corresponded with Jung regarding the translation of dream symbolism into works of art.[83]
American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock underwent Jungian psychotherapy in 1939 with Dr Joseph Henderson. His therapist made the decision to engage him through his art, and had Pollock make drawings, which led to the appearance of many Jungian concepts in his paintings.[84][85]
Contrary to some sources,[86] Jung did not visit Liverpool but recorded a dream in which he had, and of which he wrote "Liverpool is the pool of life, it makes to live." As a result a statue of Jung was erected in Mathew Street in 1987 but, being made of plaster, was vandalised and replaced by a more durable version in 1993.[87]
Federico Fellini brought to the screen an exuberant imagery shaped by his encounter with the ideas of Carl Jung, especially Jungian dream interpretation. Fellini preferred Jung to Freud because Jungian analysis defined the dream not as a symptom of a disease that required a cure but rather as a link to archetypal images shared by all of humanity.[88]
A Dangerous Method, a 2011 film directed by David Cronenberg, is a fictional dramatisation of Jung's life as a psychoanalyst between 1904 and 1913. It mainly concerns his relationships with Freud and Sabina Spielrein, a Russian analyst who became his lover, and later his student.

Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and founder of the school of analytical psychology.  He proposed and developed the concepts of the extroverted and introverted personality, archetypes, and the collective unconscious.  The issues that he dealt with arose from his personal experiences.  For many years Jung felt as if he had two separate personalities.  One introverted and other extroverted.  This interplay resulted in his study of integration and wholeness.  His work has been influential not only in psychology, but in religion and literature as well.
Jung was born on July 26, 1875 in Kesswil, Switzerland, the only son of a Protestant clergyman.  At the age of four his family moved to Basel.  His childhood was a lonely one.  Jung observed his parents and teachers and tried to understand their behavior, especially that of his father.  The elder Jung had a failing belief in religion.  Jung could never understand why.  There were numerous relatives on either side of his family that were clergymen.  It was expected of Jung to continue in the family tradition.  Jung did not decide to follow, choosing instead to attend the University of Basel from 1895-1900.  Before deciding to pursue medicine Jung studied biology, zoology, paleontology, and archaeology.  His explorations did not stop with that, he looked at philosophy, mythology, early Christian literature as well as religion.  His interest in religion could be attributed to his heritage as well as watching the demise of his father.
After leaving Basel, Jung became an assistant physician at Burgholzli Psychiatric clinic under Eugen Bleuler.  In 1902 he obtained his M.D. from the University of Zurich.  His dissertation was entitled "On the Psychology and Pathology of So -Called Occult Phenomena".  Through this work one of his basic concepts is outlined, the underlying wholeness of the psyche.   Jung's first research was conducted in 1904.  He studied word association in patients.  He found groups of repressed psychic content for which he invented the now famous word "complex."  This study brought him close to the work of Sigmund Freud.  Jung's work confirmed many of Freud's ideas.  Between 1907 and 1912 he and Freud worked very close.  Many believed that Jung would continue Freud's psychoanalysis, but this did not occur.  Over temperamental and differences concerning the significance of sexuality in human life, the two split.  Jung contested Freud's analytic principles, which he claimed were one-sided, overly-concrete, and personalistic.  Their relationship was finished forever when Jung published "Psychology and the Unconscious" which argued against some of Freud's ideas .  In 1912 "Symbols and Transformations of the Libido" was published.  Jung wanted to understand the symbolic meaning of the contents of the unconscious.  In order to distinguish between individual psychology and psychoanalysis Jung gave his discipline the name "analytical psychology."
After a break with the start of WWI, Jung wrote the book "Psychological Types".  It set the differences between his position and that of Freud.  Jung became more interested in the study of mythological and religious symbolism.  His studies took him across the globe where he observed many different cultures.    He was interested in tracing the analogies between the contents of the unconscious in Western man and the myths, cults, and rituals of primitive peoples.  Jungian therapy deals with dreams and fantasies.   A discussion is set up between the conscious and the contents of the unconscious.  When the therapy works the patient enters an individuation process.    This consists of psychological transformations ending in the opposite tendencies working together to achieve personal wholeness. Jung's total amount of work is very large.  It is estimated that he authored 200 papers.  An edition of his Collected Works in English was completed in 1972 by the Bollingen Foundation in New York and Routledge and Kegan Paul in London.
Jung believed that symbol creation was a key in understanding human nature.  Symbol, as defined by Jung, is the best possible expression for something essentially unknown.  He wanted to investigate the similarity of symbols that are located in different religious, mythological, and magical systems which occur in many cultures and time periods.  To account for these similar symbols occurring across different cultures and time periods he suggested the existence of two layers of the unconscious psyche.  The first of the two layers was the personal unconscious.  It contains what the individual has acquired in his or her life, but has been forgotten or repressed.  The second layer is the collective unconscious which contains the memory traces common to all humankind.  These experiences form archetypes.  These are innate predispositions to experience and symbolize certain situations in a distinct way.  There are many archetypes such as having parents, finding a mate, having children, and confronting death.  Very complex archetypes are found in all mythological and religious systems.  Near the end of his life Jung added that the deepest layers of the unconscious function independently of the laws of space, time and causality.  This is what gives rise to paranormal phenomena.
The introvert and the extrovert are the main components of personality according to Jung.  The introvert is quiet, withdrawn and interested in ideas rather than people.  While the extrovert is outgoing and socially oriented.  For Jung a person that had a healthy personality can realize these opposite tendencies within himself/herself and can express each.  Dreams serve to compensate for any neglected parts of the personality.

Carl Jung was an early 20th century psychotherapist and psychiatrist who created the field of analytical psychology. He is widely considered one of the most important figures in the history of psychology.
Carl Gustav Jung was born in Switzerland in 1875 to Emilie Preiswerk and Paul Jung, a pastor. Because of his father’s faith, Jung developed a keen interest in religious history, but he settled on the study of medicine at the University of Basel. After he completed his medical degree, Jung joined the staff at Burghoelzli Clinic in Zurich, Switzerland as an intern to Eugen Bleuler, where he explored the unconscious mind and its related complexes. He also traveled to Paris to study under Pierre Janet in 1902. In 1905, Jung was appointed to the faculty at the University of Zurich where he worked until 1913.
Jung married Emma Rauschenbach in 1903. The couple had five children and remained married until Emma's death in 1955, although Jung's extramarital affairs were extensive. Jung died in Switzerland in 1961. 
Jung sent a copy of his book Studies in Word Association to Sigmund Freud in 1906, and Freud reciprocated by inviting Jung to visit Vienna. Their friendship lasted until 1913, at which time they parted ways due to a difference in academic opinion. Jung agreed with Freud’s theory of the unconscious, but Jung also believed in the existence of a deeper collective unconscious and representative archetypes. Freud openly criticized Jung's theories, and this fundamental difference caused their friendship and psychological views to diverge.   
Jung traveled throughout the world to teach and influence others with his psychoanalytical theories. He published many books relating to psychology, and others that seemed outside the realm science, including Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies, which examined and dissected the psychological significance of UFO sightings. Jung’s work embodied his belief that each person has a life purpose that is based in a spiritual self. Through his eastern, western, and mythological studies, Jung developed a theory of transformation called individuation that he explored in Psychology and Alchemy, a book in which he detailed the relationship of alchemies in the psychoanalytical process.
Carl Jung is recognized as one of the most influential psychiatrists of all time. He founded analytical psychology and was among the first experts in his field to explore the religious nature behind human psychology. He argued that empirical evidence was not the only way to arrive at psychological or scientific truths and that the soul plays a key role in the psyche. Key contributions of Jung include:
Dream analysis and the interpretation of symbols from the collective unconscious that show up in dreams. 
Extroversion and introversion: Jung was the first to identify these two personality traits, and some of his work continues to be used in the theory of personality and in personality testing. 
Psychological complexes: A cluster of behaviors, memories, and emotions grouped around a common theme. For example, a child who was deprived of food might grow into an adult smoker, nail biter, and compulsive eater, focusing on the theme of oral satiation. 
An emphasis on spirituality: Jung argued that spirituality and a sense of the connectedness of life could play a profound role in emotional health. 
Individuation: The integration and balancing of dual aspects of personality to achieve psychic wholeness, such as thinking and feeling, introversion and extroversion, or the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. Jung argued that people who have individuated are happier, more ethical, and more responsible. 
The persona and the shadow: The persona is the public version of the self that serves as a mask for the ego, and the shadow is a set of infantile, suppressed behaviors and attitudes. 
Synchronicity: A phenomenon that occurs when two seemingly unrelated events occur close to one another, and the person experiencing the events interprets this correlation as meaningful. 
In addition, some of Jung's patients helped to found Alcoholics Anonymous, inspired by Jung's belief in an evangelic cure for alcoholism.

=======================================================
Swiss  psychiatrist and influential thinker.   Carl Jung founded a new school of depth psychology,  which he named Analytical  Psychology.
Carl Gustav Jung was born on July 26, 1875, in Kesswil,   Switzerland.  His father, Johann Paul Achilles Jung  (1842-1896) was a pastor.  His mother,  Emilie Preiswerk Jung (1848-1923), was the daughter of an established family in  Basel.
As a child, Jung  preferred to be left alone to play by himself. He was happy when he was in  isolation with his thoughts.  His father  taught him Latin and his mother read to him about exotic religions from an  illustrated children’s book, to which he frequently returned to view with  fascination the pictures of Hindu gods.
According to Jung (1963/1989), in the summer of 1887, when he was 12 years old, a classmate threw him on the ground very hard and he became unconscious. A sudden thought came to his mind, that he could now stop going to school.  From that day, he fainted whenever he had to do his homework or go to school. The doctors thought he had epilepsy, so he stayed home for six months. Then one day, he heard his father talking with a visitor. He was very worried that Carl would not be able to work and support himself in the future. At that moment the boy became serious. He decided he needed to work. He immediately started studying his Latin grammar. Although this effort made him faint three times, he insisted and eventually overcame his problem. Actually now he felt much better than before. He continued to work with his schoolbooks every day and a few weeks later he returned to school. He never suffered another attack. That event had taught him what  neurosis is.  (pp. 30-32) 
He decided to  study medicine.  Maybe this decision was  influenced by his grandfather’s reputation, who had been professor of surgery  at the University   of Basel.
One day, in the  library of a college classmate’s father he found a book on spiritualistic  phenomena that immediately absorbed him.   The phenomena described were similar to those stories he had been  hearing in the countryside.  He also knew  that similar stories existed in all parts of the world, from people of  different religions.  So, he concluded,  these phenomena must be connected with the human psyche.
The following  events turned him from medicine and surgery to psychiatry, during the last  months of his studies.
According to Jung (1963/1989), in the summer of  1898, he was studying in his room, with the door half open to the dining room,  where his mother was knitting by the window.    A very loud crack, like a pistol, surprised  them and the circular walnut, solid wood table beside her had split, from the  rim to beyond the center. (pp. 104-105)
About 2 weeks later, Jung (1963/1989) says  he returned home in the afternoon and found his mother, his fourteen-year-old  sister, and the maid very upset. About an hour earlier they had heard another  deafening crack. This time it had come from the direction of the sideboard, a  heavy piece of furniture dating from the early nineteenth century.  They had already examined it and could not find anything  strange.  Jung immediately began  examining the sideboard and the entire surrounding area.  In the interior of the sideboard, in the  cupboard containing the bread basket he found a bread knife, with its steel  blade broken to pieces.  Its handle in  one corner of the basket, pieces of the blade in all other corners of the  basket.  Carl Jung  kept the fragments of that knife, until his death. (pp.  105-106)
Little did he realize at the time that in  the future he would study these phenomena as a part of mind’s functioning.
At that time, psychiatry was not highly respected, so Carl Jung had little interest in it. But when he opened his psychiatric textbook, Krafft-Ebing’s "Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie", 4th edn. ( 1890 ), and read that psychoses are "diseases of the personality" his heart suddenly began to pound. His excitement was intense and it became very clear to him that psychiatry was going to be the goal of his life. He finally found a field to study, that included both spiritual and biological facts.
In 1902 he  completed his doctoral dissertation "On the Psychology and Pathology of  So-Called Occult Phenomena".
In 1903 Carl Jung set  up a laboratory for experimental psychopathology in Burgholzli Clinic.  The same year he married Emma Rauschendbach  who became his close collaborator until her death in 1955.  Together they had four daughters and a  son.
      In 1909 he  resigned from the Burgholzli Clinic because he was extremely busy with his  private practice.

In 1906 Carl Jung sent Sigmund Freud a collection of his early papers  entitled "Studies in the Word Association” to which Freud responded  positively.  When they first met, they  talked for thirteen hours, almost with no brake.  The two psychiatrists became friends and  worked together until 1913.  
Carl Jung disagreed  with Freud’s view that all complexes come from sexual trauma, because he had  experience with psychological problems that had different origins.  Freud also did not share the same interest  with Jung, about spiritualism and parapsychology.  
According to Jung (1963/1989),  the first real crisis in their friendship  came in spring 1909, from the following incident. Jung visited Freud in Vienna and asked his opinion on precognition and parapsychology.  But Freud was too materialistic and rejected these matters in a way that upset Jung.  A strange thing happened then.  As Freud was leaving, Jung felt his diaphragm burning and a very loud crack came from the bookcase next to them.  When Jung told Freud that this is a perfect example of paranormal phenomenon, he still denied it.  Then Jung predicted that in a moment there would be another loud noise.  And he was right; a second loud crack came from the bookcase.  Freud remained puzzled and this incident raised his mistrust towards Jung. (pp. 155-156)
The next crisis  in their friendship came in 1910, when Freud was trying to make his sexual  theory a dogma against occultism.  But  according to Carl Jung, this had nothing to do with scientific judgment, only with  Freud’s ambition.    
Despite the  incompatibility of their minds, they continued to work together until  1912.  Many believe that the break in  their friendship came by Jung’s publication of "Symbols of Transformation", which  is full of mythological symbols.  
The end of this  friendship marked the beginning of a difficult period for Carl Jung.  By renouncing Freud’s dogma, the whole  psychoanalytic community turned against him.   He was cut off from all his former professional associates and several  of his friends.   He also started the  difficult trip inside his subconscious.   This lasted six years and he recorded it in the unpublished book The Red Book.  During this time he had fantasies  of great floods sweeping over northern Europe, which were prophetic visions of World War I.  
He made long  expeditions to study different cultures and try to learn "primitive psychology"  from the primitive societies of Africa.  He traveled to East Africa, India, America  and New Mexico  where he visited the Pueblo Indians.
According to Carl Jung, our psychological purpose in life is to discover our other side, so that both sides can enjoy the whole range of our capacities. He called this spiritual experience individuation and considered it essential for our well-being.
Carl Jung studied Astrology which he believed  was related to mythology.  In 1944 he published Psychology and Alchemy in which he argues that the symbolism of alchemy is directly related to the  psychoanalytical process.  For him,  alchemy was not the search for a way to transform material lead into  gold. It was transformation of the human soul on its path to perfection.  Lead is just a symbol for the impure soul and gold is a symbol for the  perfected soul. Jung’s private collection of rare alchemic books was one  of the finest in the world.
Carl Jung  deeply influenced psychology and society.   Some of his most remarkable contributions are:

Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist, an influential thinker and the founder of analytical psychology (also known as Jungian psychology). Jung's radical approach to psychology has been influential in the field of depth psychology and in counter-cultural movements across the globe. Jung is considered as the first modern psychologist to state that the human psyche is "by nature religious" and to explore it in depth. His many major works include "Analytic Psychology: Its Theory and Practice," "Man and His Symbols," "Memories, Dreams, Reflections," "The Collected Works of Carl G. Jung," and "The Red Book."

Early in his life, Carl Gustav Jung was an admirer and protege of Freud, but after their celebrated quarrel he became his enemy and rival. With his discovery of the collective unconscious (the part of the mind we may share with all other human beings, living and dead), with his profound interest in myth and symbol and his explorations into the true alchemy, astrology and even UFOs, Jung is now established as a source of "alternative" ideas that have fascinated generations. This biography portrays an extraordinary man and thinker. Frank McLynn has also written biographies of Charles Edward Stuart, the explorers Stanley and Richard Burton, and Robert Louis Stevenson.
Early in his life, Carl Gustav Jung was an admirer and protege of Freud, but after their celebrated quarrel he became his enemy and rival. With his discovery of the collective unconscious (the part of the mind we may share with all other human beings, living and dead), with his profound interest in myth and symbol and his explorations into the true alchemy, astrology and even UFOs, Jung is now established as a source of "alternative" ideas that have fascinated generations. This biography portrays an extraordinary man and thinker. Frank McLynn has also written biographies of Charles Edward Stuart, the explorers Stanley and Richard Burton, and Robert Louis Stevenson.
       McLynn's earlier books, a portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and considerations of the European exploration of Africa, inadvertently paved the way for this magisterial biography of Jung, a literary theoretician and explorer of the great unmapped terrain of the psyche. Complex, controversial, and profoundly influential, Jung presents the biographer with Herculean tasks, and McLynn's performance is heroic. He begins by describing Jung as "not untypical" of the Swiss, that is, conservative, xenophobic, melancholy, and obstinate. A family history follows, a litany of turbulent marriages, inherited clairvoyance, and careers in medicine and the church, all subterraneanly linked to Jung's revolutionary introduction of spirituality into psychology. As McLynn chronicles each stage of Jung's life--from his unhappy school years to his calculated marriage, close collaboration and exceedingly traumatic break with Freud, and the writing of his seminal works--he strikes a balance between deep respect for Jung's brilliant interpretations of the human experience and frank acknowledgement of his lack of compassion, a failing that made him a womanizer, an unloving father, and a Nazi sympathizer. Confounding as his darker side is, Jung was a man of awesome powers and vision, and his revelations will continue to shape our culture for many years to come.  Donna Seaman
       A thorough and often critical biography of the second most important figure in 20th-century psychology (the first of two Jung biographies due out this fall). Veteran biographer and intellectual historian McLynn (Robert Louis Stevenson, 1994, etc.) appropriately devotes a great deal of space to the final break in 1912 between Freud and his onetime protg Jung. The author does an excellent job of delineating their intellectual differences: In contrast to psychology's founding father, Jung rejected the near-monocausality of sexuality for psychological disorders, downplayed the role of transference in treatment, and was highly sympathetic to religion's role in the search for meaning and psychic health. While praising his subject's ``astonishing fertility of ideas and . . . eclecticism of inspiration,'' McLynn demonstrates how disturbed many of his most important personal relationships were. The author concludes that, having had many affairs, Jung ``had destroyed both [his wife Emma's] life and that of Toni Wolff [his longest and most important mistress] as thoroughly as it was possible for a human to do by his habitual infidelities, his coldness, his ruthlessness and his rating of anima archetypes over flesh-and-blood women.'' On the most controversial aspect of the Swiss thinker's life, McLynn is restrained and fair-minded but pulls no punches in revealing how Jung was ``at best ambivalent and, at worst, openly supportive'' toward the Nazis in the 1930s. And if he was often intellectually insightful and culturally sophisticated, Jung was also prone to fatuous one-dimensional judgments of others. In addition, Jung's presentation of his ideas often was stylistically murky and sometimes even self-contradictory. While McLynn could have explained a few of Jung's more recondite ideas more fully, this very solid, well-paced biography will help readers understand both why Jung was so intensely admired and hated, and why, in terms of intellectual influence, he came to be so thoroughly overshadowed by his great nemesis, Freud. (For an even harsher view of Jung, see Richard Noll, The Aryan Christ, p. 935.) -- Copyright ©1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.
Ok, so the Jungians have done themselves no favors by publishing biographies of Jung that are one-sidedly laudatory. However, the solution is not, in my opinion, to compose counter-biographies that are one-sidedly  negative.After being disappointed with Noll's sensationalist books on  Jung, I was hoping that McLynn's biography would be more even-handed.  It  had, after all, drawn very favorable reviews.On one hand, thanks to  McLynn's efforts, I learned a lot more about Jung than I knew before.  However,McLynn's overwhelmingly negative, even petty, evaluation of Jung  quickly became both tedious and frustrating as I forced myself to finish  it.If one wishes to know, in exhaustive detail, everything Jung ever  did that could expose him to criticism, this book is useful.  However, if  one wishes to have a complete view of Jung, both positive and negative,  this book is extremely misleading.One source of frustration was the  obvious fact that McLynn did not understand Jung's writings, and did not  wish to take the time to understand them.  It is not enough to dismiss his  works as "impenetrable" (a word which, along with  "farrago," "besotted," and "emollient,"  McLynn uses with excruciating frequency.) Lesser minds than McLynn's, such  as my own, have managed to "penetrate" Jung's works and found  them illuminating.Another source of frustration was McLynn's penchant  for taking gratuitous swipes at almost anyone or anything he finds  deficient, as an adjunct to skewering Jung.  Why, for example, was it  necessary for McLynn to suggest that Jung resembled Physicist Richard  Feynmann in having a "taste for the low life." What has Feynmann  to do with the issue? What is Feynmann's unstated connection with the  "low life"? Why, for another example, does McLynn feel so  confident that much of Zen Buddhism is "pure  nonsense"?McLynn's dismissive attitude towards Jung's admirers,  particularly his women students, is particularly unconvincing and  mean-spirited. McLynn seems to sort them into two categories: mistresses,  and would-be mistresses who were notable primarily for their lack of  physical attractiveness. As just one example, for McLynn to ridicule  Marie-Louise Von Franz as the author of mere incomprehensible gibberish  goes beyond the realm of fair comment.In short, if the reader is seeking  a sarcasm-laden, repetitive expose of a famous man, look no further than  this volume.  However, if you wish truly to know Jung, this book will be a  disappointment.  An unbiased biography of Carl Jung has yet to be written. Read more ›
  McLynn pointed a very bright light at Jung, and *gasp* came up with an unflattering picture.  Now, I have no problem with this approach, as it reveals fully the humanness of Jung and counters the usual hagiography by Jungians, but why raise the banner of Freud as you are lowering Jung's?  McLynn has done a tremendous amount of research and is an excellent writer (his overuse of words, such as "adumbrated" aside), but once I got a whiff of McLynn's pro-Freud agenda, the book became just another salvo in the unending battle between the two camps.  I wish McLynn had put his Freudian cards on the table at the beginning of the book.
  Anybody interested in Jung should read this  book, but read it with a grain of salt. The author is no great admirer of Jung; was this a result of learning so much about him while writing his biography? I do not know, but  I am grateful to McLynn for writing a book that has taught me so much about  a man who has taught me so much.That said, let me state that this book  can by no means substitute for reading Jung. The brilliance, fire, and life  of his writing is almost entirely absent from this book: a great loss.Also absent are photographs. I would like to see what Jung and Co.  looked like at various stages.So let's put out a new version with  photos!
This book is an in-depth biography of Carl Gustav Jung, encompassing his private life as well as his scholarly work.  It begins with the Jung's ancestors on both his father's and mother's sides, and continues through Jung's death in 1961. McLynn describes Jung's elementary school years, high school, university, and post-graduate training at the Burghoeltzli Mental Hospital.  His relationships are treated in great detail, including those with his wife and mistresses, as well as with Freud and other colleagues.  Each of his scholarly works is also treated to summary and analysis as it falls into the chronological record of Jung's life.  Jung and his contacts left much material behind from which to draw details and anecdotes for this biography, everything from Jung's personal dreams to reactions of notables such as Freud to comments made at dinner parties.I had very little knowledge of Jung (or Freud) before reading this book, but I feel the book has given me a basic familiarity with the man, and with some of his work.  McLynn does a decent job of explaining the complex ideas presented in Jung's scholarly works in a manner that is mostly accessible to those with no training in the field.  Nevertheless, he does use some terminology (Jung's?) such as "number one" and "number two" when referring to parts of a single person's personality which remain completely unclear to me.This is certainly the least sympathetic biography of any person I have ever read.  From McLynn's descriptions, Jung was a self-centered bully and polygamist, to just begin a list of his character flaws.  From McLynn's account, I thought these aspects of his character were well-known, but when I tried discussing them with psychologist friends, they were disturbed by my repeating such terms, found frequently in the book.  Is it because McLynn overplays negative aspects of Jung's personality, or because there are certain generations of American psychologists who continue to deny that Jung was not an unpleasant man?  With nothing else to go on besides this book, I have no way to judge the veracity of the claims myself.  But to the uninformed reader, the book seems extremely well-researched, and will give an in-depth introduction into the life of one of the most important academic figures of the Twentieth Century.

  This book is clearly well researched and quite well written. Overall, however I found that McLynn appears to side with Freud in the personal (and theoretical) struggles between the two giants of Psychology and Personality theory.  With regard to personal issues he clearly accepts the fact that Jung had an affair with Sabina Speilrein but dismisses the idea that Freud was intimately involved with Minna Bernays.  Even more significantly he plays down the fact that Jung made a major effort to send money to Freud to help him and his family escape from the Nazis in 1938 while Freud NEVER had a kind word for Jung after 1912.
  On the back cover of the book, a phrase from _The Independent Weekend_ is quoted prominently: "McLynn's painfully accumulated evidence is handled scrupulously. Read more
