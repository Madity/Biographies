 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          David Fincher was born in 1962 in Denver, Colorado, and was raised in Marin County, California. When he was 18 years old he went to work for John Korty at Korty Films in Mill Valley. He subsequently worked at ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) from 1981-1983. Fincher left ILM to direct TV commercials and music videos after signing with N. Lee Lacy in Hollywood. He went on to found Propaganda in 1987 with fellow directors Dominic Sena, Greg Gold and Nigel Dick. Fincher has directed TV commercials for clients that include Nike, Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Heineken, Pepsi, Levi's, Converse, AT&T and Chanel. He has directed music videos for Madonna, Sting, The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, George Michael, Iggy Pop, The Wallflowers, Billy Idol, Steve Winwood, The Motels and, most recently, A Perfect Circle.As a film director, he has achieved huge success with Se7en (1995), Fight Club (1999) and, Panic Room (2002).
        [single frame insert] His movies often features several single frames that flash on the screen in the middle of a scene (Fight Club (1999)).
        Fluid tracking camera which can access anywhere; a digital age innovation in camera movement pioneered by David Fincher and Kevin Tod Haug along with BUF Paris (perhaps inspired by earlier developments of Max Ophüls and Stanley Kubrick).
        [Silhouettes] Frequently has characters in the shadows where you cannot make out their face (Kevin Spacey in Se7en (1995) and Brad Pitt in Fight Club (1999)).
        Frequently casts Brad Pitt (Se7en (1995), Fight Club (1999), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)).
        Often displays end credits as slide shows (Fight Club, Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) or scrolling downward (Se7en) rather than the traditional upward scroll.
        His films often show computer hackers with poor social skills (Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network (2010), Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011))
        Films about finding a serial killer (Seven (1995), Zodiac (2007), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011))
        Frequently starts his movies with creative title sequences which expresse the theme of the movie
      His video for Madonna's "Express Yourself" voted #1 in Slant Magazines Top 100 Videos. 2 of his other Madonna videos also made the list. "Vogue" at #4 & "Oh, Father" at #11. (19th January 2003)
      Turned down the offer to direct Catch Me If You Can (2002), opting to do Panic Room (2002) instead.
      While growing up in Marin County, one of his neighbors was George Lucas. He later worked on the special effects crew of Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), produced and written by Lucas.
      It was the 1969 feature film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) that inspired him to pursue a career in cinema.
      In 2005, he directed the video for Nine Inch Nails' "Only". Ten years earlier, he used Coil's version of the Nine Inch Nails' song "Closer" during the opening credits montage of his film Se7en (1995).
      Met his partner, Ceán Chaffin, in the early '90s when she produced a Japanese Coca-Cola ad he was directing.
      At the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, three out of four nominees for Best Direction in a Video - "The End of the Innocence" by Don Henley, "Janie's Got a Gun" by Aerosmith, and "Vogue" by Madonna - were directed by him ("Vogue" won.).
      His favourite films include: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), Rear Window (1954), Being There (1979), Jaws (1975), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), 8½ (1963), Alien (1979), American Graffiti (1973), Citizen Kane (1941), Cabaret (1972) and The Year of Living Dangerously (1982).
      Directed 4 actors in Oscar nominated performances: Brad Pitt, Taraji P. Henson, Jesse Eisenberg, and Rooney Mara.
      I don't know how much movies should entertain. To me, I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about Jaws (1975) is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again.
      Directing ain't about drawing a neat little picture and showing it to the cameraman. I didn't want to go to film school. I didn't know what the point was. The fact is, you don't know what directing is until the sun is setting and you've got to get five shots and you're only going to get two.
      People will say, "There are a million ways to shoot a scene", but I don't think so. I think there're two, maybe. And the other one is wrong.
      As a director, film is about how you dole out the information so that the audience stays with you when they're supposed to stay with you, behind you when they're supposed to stay behind you, and ahead of you when they're supposed to stay ahead of you.
      [about the personality traits that helps in being a director] Belligerence certainly helps. And there's a requisite paranoia. There's fear--fear of failure--and an overwhelming urge to be liked.
      I went to a place called the Berkeley Film Institute for a summer program with a grade-school friend of mine, and we just thought it was a joke. It was very impressionist, very Berkeley. There were all these people who were there to communicate and change the world, to do all these lofty things--and then they made these really shitty, stupid little movies. And we were kind of like, "I'm not here for this, I'm just here to pull cable." We were the youngest people there and we ended up being the grips and electrics on everybody else's movies, and it was pretty good those six or seven weeks, we got to shoot Panaflex cameras and make a married print--it was in black and white and you made these little cheeseball movies, but at least you were making "something." It was kind of like film school in that way, but those who can't do, teach, and those who couldn't teach, taught there. They tried, they just didn't want to get dirty with it, they didn't want to get in up to their necks. It was all very patrician.
      I'm totally anti-commercialism. I would never do commercials where people hold the product by their head and tell you how great it is, I just wouldn't do that stuff. It's all inference . . . The Levis commercials I did weren't really about jeans, the Nike commercials weren't about shoes. The "Instant Karma" spot was some of the better stuff I got offered, and it was never about people going, "Buy this shoe, this shoe will change everything," because I think that's nonsense. Anybody looking outside themselves to make themselves whole is delusional and probably sick.
      I do agree you can't just make movies three hours long for no apparent reason. For a romantic comedy to be three hours long, that's longer than most marriages.
      I have a philosophy about the two extremes of filmmaking. The first is the "Kubrick way," where you're at the end of an alley in which four guys are kicking the shit out of a wino. Hopefully, the audience members will know that such a scenario is morally wrong, even though it's not presented as if the viewer is the one being beaten up; it's more as if you're witnessing an event. Inversely, there's the "Spielberg way," where you're dropped into the middle of the action and you're going to live the experience vicariously - not only through what's happening, but through the emotional flow of what people are saying. It's a much more involved style. I find myself attracted to both styles at different times, but mostly I'm interested in just presenting something and letting people decide for themselves what they want to look at.
      [on Alien³ (1992)] There were a lot of enormously talented people working on that movie. It's just a movie starts from a unified concept, and once you've unified the concept it becomes very easy to see the things you're not going to spend money on. And if a movie is constantly in flux because you're having to please this vice-president or that vice-president of production .. . I think a movie set's a fascist dictatorship--you have to go in and know what it is you want to do because you have to tell 90 people what it is you want to do and it has to be convincing. Otherwise, when they start to question it, the horse can easily run away with you and it's bigger than you are. So that was a movie where the time was not taken upfront to say, "This is what we're doing, and all of this is what we're not doing." So as we were shooting, a lot of people--I suppose in an effort to make it "better" or "more commercial" or more like the other ones they liked as opposed to the one that you liked--took to being extremely helpful, so that this could be more James Cameron than James Cameron. And of course you're sitting there going, "Guys, remember I don't have any guns. I don't have any tripod guns or flamethrowers or any of that shit!" If a movie gets off on a wrong foot, when you've never done it before you assume everyone is going to be there to help you right the ship, but really you're beholden to a lot of banana republics. I worked on it for two years, got fired off it three times and I had to fight for every single thing. No one hated "Alien 3" more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me. It was a baptism by fire. I was very naive. For a number of years, I'd been around the kind of people who financed movies and the kind of people who are there to make the deals for movies. But I'd always had this naive idea that everybody wants to make movies as good as they can be, which is stupid. I thought, "Well, surely you don't want to have the Twentieth Century-Fox logo over a shitty movie." And they were like, "Well, as long as it opens." They didn't care.
      [on losing his father, Jack Fincher] I remember the experience of being there when he breathed his last breath. It was incredibly profound. When you lose someone who helped form you in lots of ways, who is your 'true north', you lose the barometer of your life. You're no longer trying to please someone, or you're no longer reacting against something. In many ways, you're truly alone.
      I don't think of myself as difficult. We're expected to do stuff that's awesome. That means we're going to have to push each other.
Panic Room (2002) is a movie as opposed to a film. A movie is made for an audience and a film is made for both the audience and the film-makers. I think that The Game (1997) is a movie and I think Fight Club (1999)'s a film. I think that "Fight Club" is more than the sum of its parts, whereas "Panic Room" IS the sum of its parts. I didn't look at "Panic Room" and think, "Wow, this is gonna set the world on fire". These are footnote movies, guilty pleasure movies. Thrillers. Woman-trapped-in-a-house movies. They're not particularly important.
      [on Fight Club (1999)] We opened at the Venice film festival, and I think to say they hated it would be an understatement. Let's put it this way: the youngest person in the screening was Giorgio Armani. They called for our hides and we split town. We thought it was funny. Actually, Helena Bonham Carter's mother was three seats down from me and she was just laughing and laughing - she was the only one. She's cool. I'm always surprised at how seriously people take movies. It always surprises me what people get their bowels in an uproar about. It's a movie. It was interesting to me, the critics who felt they had a moral obligation to 'the broader audience' to warn them. But it didn't surprise me that some people didn't think it was funny. It didn't surprise me that some people thought it was morbid. It surprised me, the people who went out of their way to save other people from this experience. I thought that was kind of silly. It's a cult movie - it's just that it's a big cult. Here's a tricky thing: if you spend $15m, it's not even a pimple on the ass of that kind of multinational media conglomerate. But if you spend $67m, they gotta release your movie. That's a big number, they can't write it down. I happen to know that the movie's in the black, but there's receipts and there's worth. They are two different things. Because there are movies that make money and there are movies that are worth money, and sometimes the movies that are worth money make money later on. I honestly believe Fight Club is a title 20th Century Fox knows is going to make money for them in perpetuity.
      I am a contrarian by nature, so all it does is make me want to take real risks. I am like, 'If we are not out on the ledge juggling chain saws, then we are doing ourselves a huge disservice.'
      Part of my testiness is that I feel I make fifty compromises a day. When people come to me to say 'Why can't you compromise?' I'm like: 'What are you talking about? The fact that we're having this conversation means that we've compromised'.
      People always ask why I don't make independent movies. I do make independent movies - I just make them at Sony and Paramount.
      [on getting at least 60% of what you want on a film set] . . . I think that's probably on a good day. I would say probably, on a given film, Fight Club (1999) is probably closest to what we wanted to do. It's about 75% of what we wanted. I think Panic Room (2002), even though it was storyboarded within an inch of its life, was probably 60%. The Social Network (2010), I wasn't transposing what I had in my head on it, because I was really following the text, and following these kids, so that movie was, y'know, about 70-75% of what I thought it was going to be. This movie is probably about that. I think you're doing pretty good if you can get 70% of what you want.
      Everything seems really simple on paper until you take a camera out of the box. Then ninety people are offering up solutions to the problems those pages create. You're trying to make something very clear in this maelstrom of activity, with all this anxiety about how much money is being spent. I don't think you can ever make it the way you have it in your head.
      [on the prevalence of violence in modern society] I think civilization is an agreement, and once in a while you're going to run into people who didn't get the memo.
      [on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)] I think this movie is more about sexual politics. Mikael Blomkvist moves freely among women and doesn't have any problems with them, but his relationships aren't always mature. I think you can say that about a lot of male-female relationships. The men are not really present.
      You're supposed to have an idea of what it is you're trying to do, right? Aren't you being overpaid to have that? My job is to know what the fuck I want.

Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
David Andrew Leo Fincher (born August 28, 1962) is an American film director and music video director. Fincher was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for his 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and his 2010 film The Social Network. For The Social Network, Fincher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and the BAFTA Award for Best Direction. His most recent film is 2011's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, an English-language adaptation of Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name.
In an interview with Empire magazine in 2008, Fincher named the following films as his favorite; Alien, All That Jazz, All the President's Men, American Graffiti, Being There, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Cabaret, Chinatown, Citizen Kane, Days of Heaven, Dr. Strangelove, 8½, The Exorcist, The Godfather Part II, The Graduate, Jaws, Lawrence of Arabia, Mad Max 2, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, National Lampoon's Animal House, Paper Moon, Rear Window, Taxi Driver, The Terminator, The Year of Living Dangerously, and Zelig.[3]

Fincher was born on August 28, 1962 in Denver, Colorado, the son of Claire Mae (née Boettcher), a mental health nurse who worked in drug addiction programs, and Howard Kelly Fincher a.k.a. Jack Fincher, who was an author and worked as a bureau chief for Life; he died of cancer in April 2003.[1][4] When Fincher was two years old, the family moved to San Anselmo in Marin County, California. Fincher moved to Ashland, Oregon in his teens, where he graduated from Ashland High School. Inspired by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Fincher began making movies at age eight with an 8 mm camera. He attended the Berkeley Film Institute. David was employed at Korty Films where he worked on the animated Twice Upon a Time. He was later hired by Industrial Light & Magic in 1983, where he worked on productions for Return of the Jedi, and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In 1984, he left ILM to direct a commercial for the American Cancer Society, that would show a fetus smoking a cigarette. This quickly brought Fincher to the attention of producers in Los Angeles and he was given the chance to direct the documentary The Beat of the Live Drum featuring Rick Springfield in 1985. Though he would continue to direct spots for companies like Revlon, Converse, Nike, Pepsi, Sony, and Levi's, Fincher soon discovered music videos and went on to direct many promos.

Set on a directing career, Fincher joined video-production company Propaganda Films and started off directing music videos and commercials. Like Fincher, directors such as Michael Bay, Spike Jonze, Mark Romanek, Michel Gondry, Paul Rachman, Zack Snyder, Gore Verbinski, Alex Proyas, Antoine Fuqua and others honed their talents at Propaganda Films before moving on to feature films.
His video for Don Henley's "The End of the Innocence" won Henley the MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video in 1990. He also earned back-to-back MTV Video Music Awards for Best Direction in 1989 for "Express Yourself" and in 1990 for "Vogue". In 1990, he earned three of the four available nominations in the Best Direction category. On January 26th, 2014 he won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video for 'Suit & Tie' at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.

After directing several music videos, Fincher's feature debut was Alien 3. While it received an Oscar nomination for special effects, the film was not well received by critics or moviegoers. Fincher became involved with several disputes with 20th Century Fox over script and budget issues. In "The Director’s Cut",[11] he blames the producers for not putting the necessary trust in him. Fincher stated in an interview with The Guardian in 2009:
After this, Fincher retreated back into the world of commercial and music video directing, including the video for the Grammy Award winning track "Love Is Strong" (1994) by The Rolling Stones.
In 1995, Fincher directed Seven. The film, based on a screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker, told the story of two detectives (played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) tracking down a serial killer who bases his killings on the seven deadly sins. The film grossed more than $100 million domestically (over $300 million internationally).[12] The chairman of New Line Cinema, Arnold Kopelson, originally refused to allow filming of the shocking climatic scene. With the aid of Brad Pitt, who stated that he would not be involved with the picture if its ending were changed, Fincher was allowed to film the original scene and use it in the final cut.
After the success of Seven, Fincher went on to film The Game (1997). The story focused on a closed-off San Francisco businessman (played by Michael Douglas) who receives an unusual gift from his younger brother (Sean Penn), in which he becomes the main player of a role-playing game that takes over his life. The film had middling box-office returns despite being well received by critics.
Fight Club was a screen adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk’s novel of the same name about an insomniac office worker who opens up a club devoted exclusively to bare knuckle fighting for men. Featuring Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Seven collaborator Brad Pitt, the 1999 film was an early disappointment at the box-office and received mixed reviews. Fight Club was panned by several critics and alienated audiences leading to its box office failure in the United States.
However, many critics and audiences later changed their opinions and the film appeared on many 'best of the year' lists and soon developed a cult following. Entertainment Weekly, which had originally given the film a D-,[13] later ranked the DVD #1 on its list of 50 Essential DVDs.[14] Exceptional sales[citation needed] have since established it as a cult film.
In 2006 the British magazine Total Film voted Fight Club number four in the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, beaten only by Jaws, Vertigo and Goodfellas at 3, 2 and 1 respectively.[15]
In 2002, Fincher followed up with the thriller Panic Room. The film earned over $92 million at the U.S. box office. The story follows a single mother (Jodie Foster) and her daughter (Kristen Stewart) as they hide in a safe room of their new house, away from criminals (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Fight Club collaborator Jared Leto) bent on finding a missing fortune. Fincher acknowledged Panic Room as a more mainstream thriller, describing the film, on the DVD's audio commentary, as "[basically] a date movie" and a "really good B movie" about "two people trapped in a closet".
Five years after Panic Room, Fincher returned on March 2, 2007 with Zodiac, an adaptation of Robert Graysmith’s books about the hunt for the Zodiac Killer that starred Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey, Jr., Anthony Edwards, and Brian Cox. The first of Fincher’s films to be shot digitally, the majority of the film was recorded on a Thompson Viper Film Stream Camera. However, high-speed film cameras were used for the Blue Rock Springs and Presidio Heights murder scenes for the slow-motion shots.[16] It was originally to be released in the fall of 2006 but was pushed back after Fincher refused to cut 20 minutes off the film.
Zodiac was one of the best-reviewed films of that year, with only two other 2007 films appearing on more top-10 lists (No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood).[17] However, the film struggled at the box office in the U.S., earning only $33 million, but did well overseas with a foreign gross of $51.7 million. Worldwide, Zodiac was a decent success.[18] Despite an aggressive campaign by the studio, expectations surrounding Robert Downey, Jr.’s supporting performance, Fincher’s direction and Vanderbilt’s adapted script, the film did not earn a single Academy Award nomination.[19]
A story about life and death, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s short story of the same name. The film was Fincher’s third with Brad Pitt. The film started shooting in November 2006 in New Orleans, before moving on to the Virgin Islands, Montreal, and L.A. Both Zodiac and this film are co-productions of Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. The budget for the film was estimated at $150 million, partly due to the CGI effects used to reverse the aging in Brad Pitt’s character. The film is the first PG-13 film directed by Fincher. It received 13 nominations at the 81st Academy Awards, including Fincher's first nomination for Best Director. It won three Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, and Best Visual Effects.
Fincher directed the 2010 film The Social Network, about the legal battles of Mark Zuckerberg and the founding of Facebook. The film features an Oscar-winning screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, adapted from the book The Accidental Billionaires. Featuring a young cast ensemble, the film was produced by Scott Rudin, Kevin Spacey and Michael DeLuca. Filming started in October 2009[20] and was released a year later, to critical acclaim. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross created the Oscar-winning soundtrack for the film, Fincher had long been a fan of Reznor's work in Nine Inch Nails, even putting a remix of "Closer" in the beginning of Seven and directing the music video for "Only". The film went on to win many awards, including four Golden Globes (including Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score), three BAFTAs (including Best Direction), and three Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing.[21]
Fincher directed the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which was based on the book by Stieg Larsson, with a script written by Steven Zaillian. The film was shot in Sweden, with Rooney Mara (who played Erica Albright in The Social Network) as Lisbeth Salander, Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist, Robin Wright as Erika Berger, Stellan Skarsgård as Martin Vanger and Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger. The film was released on December 21, 2011. Dragon Tattoo writer Steve Zaillian is in the early stage of scripting The Girl Who Played with Fire, which Fincher has the option to direct. While he has not yet committed to the project, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker has admitted that (should he sign on) he would prefer to shoot both the second and third Millennium book adaptations back-to-back, for both practical and artistic purposes.[22][23] Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the soundtrack for the film (their second collaboration with Fincher).[24] It received five Academy Award nominations at the 84th Academy Awards including: Best Actress for Rooney Mara, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, Best Sound Mixing and won one award for Best Film Editing.
Fincher is executive producer of the Netflix television series House of Cards; he also directed the first two episodes.[25] The series has received critical acclaim, receiving 9 Primetime Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series and Fincher for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the first episode, which he would win.[26]
On January 22, 2013, Fincher was reported to be in talks to direct the adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel, Gone Girl,[27] a report that was later confirmed on July 11 of the same year with the casting of Ben Affleck in the lead role.[28] Production began in September 2013.[29] It was later given a release date of October 3, 2014.[30]
As a music video director, Fincher has won two Grammy Awards for Best Music Video, for his work in "Love Is Strong" by The Rolling Stones (1995) and "Suit & Tie" by Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z (2013), and three MTV Video Music Awards for Best Direction, being one of the most awarded directors in the category, alongside Spike Jonze.

=======================================================
From All Movie Guide: With only a handful of credits tucked under his belt, wunderkind prodigy David Fincher became one of the most celebrated artists to scale the heights of Tinseltown during the late '90s and early 2000s. Although Fincher met with some derision early on, as the director of the critically excoriated Alien 3 in 1992, his work on Seven three years down the road won him critical approval and unanimous acceptance across the industry, and marked only the beginning of an influential, splashy career.Born on May 10, 1962, Fincher originally hailed from Denver. Like one of his predecessors, the infamous Kenneth Anger, he stepped behind a camera at the tender age of eight and, particularly inspired by the work of George Lucas, reeled in his first major industry job ten years later at Lucas' own Industrial Light and Magic. After his four-year stint at ILM, during which he worked on such productions as Return of the Jedi (1983) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Fincher helmed commercials and music videos for the likes of Aerosmith, Paula Abdul, and Madonna. Following the disappointment of Alien 3, his directorial debut, the filmmaker received Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay for Seven, and almost immediately signed on to helm it; it reached cinemas in late 1995. A noirish, grimly atmospheric crime thriller starring Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as detectives following the gruesome trail of a serial killer (Kevin Spacey), innumerable critics hailed the picture as one of the most innovative and unsettling of the decade, and duly established its director as one of Hollywood's most exciting and unusual new talents. Relentlessly grim and oozing with rancid cynicism, this A-budget feature strayed so far from the escapist fare that typically primes a film for mainstream box-office success that many insiders anticipated limited appeal, but Fincher's stylistic panache and inhibition-defying gutsiness turned Seven into a runaway smash, on both commercial and critical fronts. Because the acclaim surrounding Seven made the relatively unknown Fincher one of Hollywood's hottest young directors, considerable anticipation and buzz surrounded his follow-up, The Game. Released in 1997 and starring Michael Douglas as a soulless attorney who becomes caught up in the sinister, Kafka-esque machinations of the titular scheme, the work boasted almost as much feel-bad cynicism as Seven, but failed to resonate with audiences or critics who found it hopelessly convoluted and shallow.The relative disappointment of The Game, however, did little to dim the excitement that accompanied Fincher's next project, a screen adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's apocalyptic, of-the-moment novel Fight Club. Featuring a sterling cast that included Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Seven collaborator Pitt, the 1999 film -- about a couple of depressed urban loners (Norton and Pitt), who vent their aggressions in ultra-violent street brawls -- was easily one of the most publicized of the decade and no less dynamic than either of Fincher's prior films. Fueled in equal measure by stylistic audacity and the spirit of disenfranchised machismo, Fight Club failed to become the incendiary hit both its fans and detractors predicted, although its pre-millennial nihilism influenced directors for years to come and garnered a passionate cult fan base. In spite (or perhaps because) of Fight Club, expectations were high for Fincher's next project, Panic Room, a thriller starring Jodie Foster, Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakam, and penned by the prolific David Koepp (Bad Influence, Carlito's Way). As pure an exercise in suspense as could be expected from the director, the film ratcheted up tension as it told the tale of a newly single Manhattan mother (Foster) and her diabetic daughter (Kristen Stewart) who use a high-tech "safe space" to protect themselves from a particularly nasty trio of burglars. Calling to mind the brutality of Peckinpah, Panic Room was greeted by positive reviews and a healthy box-office take, and marked a successful return to the big screen for the two-years-dormant Foster. Dormancy would characterize Fincher's career in the five years following Panic Room, although his name would be bandied about in association with a slew of high-profile projects (including Mission: Impossible III and the feature-film adaptation of Lords of Dogtown). When he finally returned in 2007, it was with Zodiac, a period thriller that resembled, at least on the surface, his Seven salad days. Pairing the director with such young, in-demand performers as Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo to tell the true story of the cryptic serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the early '70s, the highly anticipated project was given a March berth similar to that of Panic Room.As Fincher made the media rounds for Zodiac, he was deep into production on the New Orleans-set The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, an adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald story of the same name that reunited him with Brad Pitt, and co-starred Pitt's onscreen spouse from Babel, Cate Blanchett. When that film finally hit theaters, during the awards season of 2008, it rung up strong box office receipts, and garnered 13 Oscar nominations, more than any other film that year. In addition to Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay nods, the Academy handed Fincher his first nomination for Best Director.Fincher continued to enjoy success with The Social Network in 2010. The film, which chronicled the tumultuous progression of Facebook from a college project to an international phenomenon, earned Fincher an Oscar nomination for Best Director, while Jesse Eisenberg snagged the award for Best Actor. The Social Network also won Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Editing. Fresh off the success of The Social Network, Fincher went on to direct the adaptation of novelist Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), a powerful thriller that finds an unlikely pair investigating the disappearance of a woman whose uncle suspects foul play. The film was nominated for Best Picture by The Producers Guild of America and The National Board of Review, and for Outstanding Directorial Achievement by the Directors Guild of America. Fincher is slated to direct The Black Hole in 2014.

=======================================================
Born August 28, 1962 in Denver, Colorado, David Fincher is one of the most acclaimed film directors working today. Fincher made his name with dark and stylized thrillers such as “Seven,” “Fight Club,” “Panic Room,” “Zodiac,” and “The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo.” He was previously nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Director for his work on “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and “The Social Network.” He won the BAFTA and a Golden Globe for “The Social Network.”
Fincher began making films at the age of eight with an 8mm camera. After turning 18, Fincher went to work for John Korty at Korty Films. He then worked for George Lucas’s special-effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, where he worked on “Return of the Jedi” and “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” in the visual effects department. He left the company in 1984 to direct a commercial for the American Cancer Society, which brought him more work as a commercial director. Through directing music videos, Fincher began to develop his own style more and more.In 1985, Fincher joined the now-defunct Propaganda Films, a video production company founded by producers Steve Golin and Sigurjon Sighvatsson. The company became a launching pad for many directors including Spike Jonze, Antoine Fuqua, Mark Romanek, Michel Gondry, Michael Bay, Steven Hanft, Nigel Dick, David Kellogg, and Alex Proyas. Fincher began a career directing big-budget music videos for artists such as Madonna, Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Nine Inch Nails, Paula Abdul, and George Michael. Having cemented a solid reputation with these productions, Fincher was given his first opportunity to direct a feature film. "Alien 3," Fincher’s debut, proved to be a difficult production, with numerous disputes between the director and Twentieth Century Fox over budget and script issues. Fincher was reportedly convinced that his career as a feature film director was already over before it began. The film opened to tepid reviews and Fincher returned to directing music videos. Fincher returned to the feature film world with 1995’s “Seven,” which would gross over $300 million internationally. Fincher’s moody style fit well with the plot: two detectives face off against a serial killer basing his murders on the seven deadly sins. However, Fincher still encountered difficulty with the production. New Line Cinema originally refused to allow the film’s climactic ending to be filmed, opting for a different ending altogether. Brad Pitt, who was starring in the film and who would go on to work with Fincher several times, threatened to leave the production if the original ending was not kept.  New Line eventually allowed Fincher to film as he intended. Fincher followed with 1999’s “Fight Club,” based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Although initially panned by critics, the film has gone on to become a cult favorite thanks largely to its DVD release. Fincher followed with “Panic Room” in 2002, about a mother and daughter who square off against a trio of burglars who are after a fortune in the home’s panic room.Fincher returned in 2007 with “Zodiac,” his first feature to be filmed in a digital format. “Zodiac” was a slower, more deliberate film than any of Fincher’s previous efforts and also marks a turning point in the director’s oeuvre. Although it was one of the best reviewed films of that year, “Zodiac,” based on the real-life serial killer of the same name, did not command large box office profits. There was considerable speculation that the film might earn an Academy Award nomination for the director and star Robert Downey Jr. but no nominations were granted.This would change in 2008 with “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man who ages backwards. It also starred frequent collaborator Brad Pitt. The film would earn Fincher his first Oscar nomination for Best Director.In 2010, Fincher generated substantial buzz for “The Social Network,” a film written by Aaron Sorkin about Mark Zuckerberg and the origins of Facebook. The film earned Fincher a Golden Globe for Best Director and won three Academy Awards for Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score.Fincher most recently directed the highly-anticipated American film adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.” Based on its success, Fincher is also signed to complete film versions of the other two books in Larsson’s trilogy: “The Girl Who Played With Fire” and “The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest.”

"I do agree you can't just make movies three hours long for no apparent reason. For a romantic comedy to be three hours long, that's longer than most marriages." – David Fincher
                While he has a few naysayers, David Fincher's followers are loyal and strong. They worship him for simultaneously punching them in the gut with memorably depressing endings and wowing them with slick camera shots and a distinctly dark visual style.            
                It would only be natural for women to be afraid of David Fincher. As much as we like his movies, this is the guy who killed Sigourney Weaver's most iconic character, infamously put Gwyneth Paltrow's head in a box, trapped Jodie Foster and her on-screen daughter in a deadly home invasion, and did a full-fledged movie about San Francisco's notorious Zodiac killer. It definitely doesn't help his chances to appear on The Dating Game when he said, "I have demons you can't even imagine."  While we could almost imagine David Fincher getting some dating advice during a bare-knuckle boxing match with his handsome collaborator Brad Pitt, maybe we've got him all wrong and he's not really that scary. After all, he can boast model Donya Fiorentino as his ex-wife, and his last film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, contained enough sap to brighten the dark flavor of the downbeat movies that had come before it.            
                Once employed by George Lucas, David Fincher was a highly touted commercial and Grammy Award-winning music video director before permanently making the switch to films. Smoking fetuses, bizarre Madonna bras and giant images of Mick Jagger were all in a day's work before his first foray into film directing (Alien3) nearly ruined his filmmaking career before it could start. He rebounded by making screen villains scary again in Se7en and has never ceased to be innovative with each new endeavor -- whether it's making Edward Norton slap himself silly (Fight Club) or de-aging Brad Pitt all the way back to birth (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button).   David Fincher's obsessive ways and difficult reputation make him a little bit rough around the edges and his films are rarely audience-friendly. Only two of his films have earned over $100 million at the U.S. box office, and he's never won an Oscar, though he did finally get a nomination and a mainstream smash from Button. It remains to be seen whether he will follow a more mainstream path with new projects like Chef or remain suitably edgy like his proposed remake of Heavy Metal implies.            
                With an eye on the future and a mind for controversy, David Fincher started making short films with the video camera he received for his eighth birthday in his new home state of California. He was deeply influenced by films like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and the events that were occurring around him, most notably the unknown Zodiac Killer that was tormenting California. Thankfully he had some positive role models to go along with the serial killer, one of them being George Lucas who was busy filming his drive-in classic American Graffiti in David Fincher's neighborhood.  Instead of going to film school, David Fincher went straight to work on films, getting a job handling cameras for director John Korty and later joining Korty's boss, George Lucas, as an employee at Industrial Light and Magic. At the special effects company, David Fincher worked in the matte department, getting his hand in two of the '80s most popular sequels, Return of the Jedi and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. He would leave ILM to direct commercials and soon ignited controversy by filming a cancer commercial featuring a fetus puffing on a cigarette inside a womb. This kind of shocking image was symbolic of its director's bold visual style and flair for controversy. Naturally it got the attention of similar beacons for controversy -- performing artists -- and musical acts like Billy Idol, Madonna, Paula Abdul, and Aerosmith hired him to direct videos for "Cradle of Love," "Vogue," "Straight Up," and "Janie's Got a Gun" respectively. david fincher directs se7en and fight club In 1992, David Fincher directed Alien3, which had the highest production budget ever allotted to a first-time feature director. If that sounds too good to be true, it was, since most of the money was already spent before he began shooting the film… with an incomplete script. A constant struggle between director and studio led to a box office failure, sending the director back to music videos where he directed The Rolling Stones' "Love Is Strong," winning a Grammy for making giants out of Mick Jagger and company among the New York City skyscrapers.  David Fincher returned to films for 1995's Se7en, a chilling tale with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman chasing an elusive killer who models his crimes after the Seven Deadly Sins. The film's shocking ending almost didn't happen, since the studio disapproved, but when Brad Pitt threatened to leave the project, the ending stayed. The grim, depressing film resounded loudly at the box office, making Pitt a first-rate star and labeling David Fincher as Hollywood's hottest warped mind. After giving Michael Douglas the world's most mind-bending birthday present in 1997's The Game, David Fincher re-joined Brad Pitt for 1999's Fight Club, a visceral social commentary about men who beat each other senseless in a society that comes up short on genuine male emotions. Though heavily hyped, it was initially a box office failure, but it has since picked up a furious cult and critical following and remains one of Brad Pitt's most identifiable roles. It also featured one of David Fincher's bizarre trademarks -- namely the insertion of extra film frames (in this case, some shock shots of genitalia) into the movie. david fincher directs panic room and the curious case of benjamin button After directing three films in a row that were front-loaded with masculinity, David Fincher cast Nicole Kidman in his next film, 2002's home invasion thriller, Panic Room. Unfortunately, an injury forced his star out of the picture and she was replaced by Jodie Foster. The film was tamer in tone than his previous films, but it was especially stylish and aided by visual effects that took cameras all through the house. Audiences enjoyed it and the film was the director's biggest hit since Se7en. Five years later, David Fincher revisited the terror of his childhood with Zodiac, a taut examination of the unsolved case through the eyes of a cartoonist (Jake Gyllenhaal), a reporter (Robert Downey Jr.) and a detective (Mark Ruffalo). Despite the big-time cast and solid reviews, the film failed to find an audience.  In 2008, David Fincher stayed true to his epic roots, but switched genres completely for the teary drama, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, again starring his good friend, Brad Pitt. It was a two year project requiring startling special effects to age Brad Pitt backwards from an old tiny midget into a strapping young lad. The film earned over $300 million around the world and earned the director his biggest audience and most significant accolades to date, with the highlights being a Best Picture and Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards. Now with his own pick of film projects to choose from, David Fincher will next be facing his most difficult directorial task yet -- making Keanu Reeves act -- in the food-themed comedy Chef. He will also be working with fellow directors Zack Snyder, Guillermo Del Toro and Gore Verbinski on a remake of the adult-themed animated cult favorite Heavy Metal.

not well received by critics or movie goers. Depressed and disillusioned, Fincher retreated back into the world of commercial and music video directing.
Fate finally came knocking on Fincher's door with Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay for a grisly detective story titled Se7en (1995). About a serial killer creating 
his own portrait of the seven deadly sins, Se7en got Fincher the critical acclaim that he needed to really launch his film career. Catapulted partially by Brad 
In Fight Club (1999) Fincher worked with Brad Pitt again and also cast Edward Norton. Focusing on a couple of guys who beat each other up and subsequently 
start a club to do so with others, Fight Club drew much controversy for its violent content and "anti-social" characters, and was short-lived in theaters. However, his movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), also starring Pitt, met with great critical acclaim and in addition to being nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, Fincher himself received a nomination for Best Director. In 2011, he found success again, this time with The Social Network, winning a Golden Globe for Best Director.

Most fanatic fans know Fincher's professional history backwards, by heart and inside out. However, for those who are just discovering the works and genius of this great director or for everyone who simply cannot read enough about the man, I have attempted to put together a lengthy and informative biography. After all, what's a fansite without a biography section? Your additions, comments and precious trivia will be welcome and incorporated. Thanks ... -- Et voilà:Starting OutDavid Fincher was born on August 28th of 1962 in Denver, Colorado, and grew up in Marin County, California. Reportedly it were Spielberg's "Jaws", Ridley Scotts "Alien" and a 'Making Of' featurette on "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid" that made him want to become a filmmaker. Fincher earned his first hands-on experience working for John Korty at Korty Films in Mill Valley, when he was only 18 years old. Since none other than George Lucas lived in Fincher's neighborhood, he went on to work for Lucas' visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), where he quickly assembled such namely titles as "Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi" (1983) and "Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom" (1984) to this filmography. And to this day the experience of having worked behind the camera before taking the director's chair can be witnessed in Fincher's perfectionism and competence all across the board of filmmaking.Breaking InDavid Fincher left ILM in 1984 to pursue his own career, directing music videos and tv-commercials. One of his earliest, if not even his very first work was the now infamous commercial "Smoking Fetus" for the American Cancer Society -- at only 22 years of age! Fincher was offered to direct Rick Springfield's concert film "Beat Of The Live Drum" and a few of his music videos, worked for The Motels and Sting and his career took off and reached an early climax towards the end of the 1980's, working for clients that included Nike, Coca-Cola, AT&T and pop-superstars Madonna, George Michael, Billy Idol, Foreigner and Michael Jackson.In 1987, at age 25, Fincher co-founded production company Propaganda Films with (among others) fellow director Dominic Sena, which was a platform not only for producing high-quality music promos but also feature films such as "Wild At Heart", "Red Rock West" and "Being John Malkovich".Alien³In 1992 David Fincher accepted the invitation to the big screen, helming the then most expensive directorial debut in history, the $65 million franchise-flick "Alien³". Due to never-ending script changes and studio involvement Fincher and critics alike considered the film a creative and commercial disaster -- even though it went on to earn almost $160 million in world-wide box-office. Most likely the frustrating process and result of making this film lead Fincher to become one of the most perfectionistic and uncompromising directors in the business today.Se7enAndrew Kevin Walker's 1995 spec-screenplay for "Se7en" immediately caught Fincher's attention and made him return to the cinematic director's chair. This time creating one of the most chilling serial-killer thrillers ever made and with the deserved success of a cult-following and a $316 million word-wide gross. For every one of his movies David Fincher has been known to choose some of the world's most talented cinematographers, such as Harris Savides (for "The Game" and "Zodiac"), Jeff Cronenweth ("Fight Club") and Claudio Miranda ("The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"), often recruiting young talents he has previously worked with on commercials. With "Se7en" it was the seemingly odd choice of french DOP Darius Khondji that stirred the film's ingenious, indelible look.From the title-sequences, to the direction of the lighting, the camera, the editing, the choice of music and the attention to sound-design and art direction, David Fincher's films are always at the leading edge of filmmaking-zeitgeist. Kyle Cooper's title-sequence for "Se7en" was a modern masterpiece that influenced many title-sequences thereafter and was even showcased as a video-installation on the prestigous 1997 Biennale for Fine Arts in Lyon.The GameIn 1997 Propaganda Films produced Fincher's next movie, the thriller "The Game" featuring Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger. The film was well-received by critics and did moderately well, but could not follow up on the world-wide box-office success of "Se7en"."The Game" is a good example for David Fincher's choice of themes and for his great talent and interest in the cinematic and narrative manipulation of the audience. The film plays on the concept of perceived reality and keeps the protagonist in a constant struggle to determine, whether what he experiences is real or not. Fincher's films are so well made, so rich in detail and cinematic fabric that they remain appealing even after repeated viewings. This holds true for "twist ending" films like "The Game" or "Fight Club", but also for Fincher's straight, mainstream thriller "Panic Room".Fight ClubIn 1999, at 35 years of age, David Fincher re-teamed with his "Se7en" star Brad Pitt and actor Edward Norton to tackle Chuck Palahniuk's 'unfilmable' novel "Fight Club". By his own account Fincher has read the novel in one night and was determined to make the film no matter what, if necessary on a low budget without a big studio backing. Surprisingly the film was initially received with mostly negative audience and critics reactions in movie theaters, mostly due to being viewed as a film promoting "excessive violence", "dangerously instructive information" and "encouraging anti-social behaviour", and consequently reeled in a disappointing $37 million domestic B.O. The film however went on to be one of the best-selling DVD titles ever and built an enormous cult-following over the years -- so much so that some magazines even recalled their initial reviews of the film.Panic RoomJodie Foster was originally set to act in "The Game", when her character was later changed and rewritten to become Sean Penn's role. But having wanted to work together, Fincher thought of Jodie Foster to replace Nicole Kidman, who had recurring knee problems stemming from "Moulin Rouge", a few weeks into filming the claustrophobic 2002 thriller "Panic Room".Remembering Fincher's anarchistic comedy "Fight Club", "Panic Room" was doomed to seem too mainstreamy to many. The director called on PLF (Pixel Liberation Front) to create a pre-visualization for the entire film, which later resulted in some of the most perfected cinematography ever witnessed. The film displays the very peak of filmmaking craft, ranging from a superb direction, photography and editing to great sounddesign from Fincher trustee Ren Klyce. Fincher himself confesses to the film being a "little guilty pleasure popcorn movie", but it did reel in a worldwide gross of almost $200 million and is sold in an absolutely must-have 3-disc DVD set.Commercials And Digital ObsessionsDavid Fincher wanted to shoot "Panic Room" on digital systems, but felt that technology wasn't ready at the time. In the intermediate years to his next feature film, Fincher experimented with digital cameras and workflows on numerous commercials, for clients such as HP, Heineken and Motorola. Other works, such as his ads for Nike ("Speedchain", "Gamebreakers") and phone company Xelibri earned him the coveted DGA Award for "Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Commercials" in 2003.With as many as a dozen projects on his desk, that included titles like "Mission: Impossible 3", "Batman Begins" and "The Black Dahlia", Fincher ultimately decided to move forward with "Zodiac", a film about the notorious real-life serial-killer that haunted the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1970s, and "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" in a back-to-back studio deal with Paramount.ZodiacThe "Zodiac" screenplay by James Vanderbilt struck a nerve with Fincher, who remembered the horrors of growing up in the very area in which the Zodiac Killer was at large. In the rewriting process Fincher and Vanderbilt enhanced the original script (that focused on cartoonist turned crime researcher Robert Graysmith) to cover a wider set of main protagonists, including colleague Paul Avery and detective Dave Toschi, and ended up with a near 3 hour draft.Upon its march 2007 release the film was cluttered with raving reviews but did only moderately in theaters, possibly because a majority of the audience bargained for another "Se7en"-style serial-killer thriller and were disappointed to get a police-procedural instead.The Curious Case Of Benjamin ButtonDecember 19th 2008 is the now announced US-release date for Fincher's "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett -- a film that is highly anticipated for its awkward storyline (based on a shortstory by F. Scott Fitzgerald and written for the screen by "Forrest Gump" scribe Eric Roth) and groundbreaking visual effects. The trailer for the film is rumored to be released with "Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", May 22nd 2008.

"I grew up in a world of unpredictability and violence. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal and to cover my fear with anger and violence." Raised on Fear is a true story by Lee Cox. A self healing, must-read. Buy today and get free shipping.
From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders. Contact the EVE Foundation to have Lee speak at your next event.
