Brian Hugh Warner (born January 5, 1969), better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson, is an American musician, songwriter, actor, painter, multimedia artist and former music journalist known for his controversial stage personality and image as the eponymous lead singer of the band Marilyn Manson, of which he is the founder and only constant member. His stage name was formed by juxtaposing the names of two American cultural icons, namely actress Marilyn Monroe and Manson Family leader Charles Manson.[1][2][3]
He is perhaps best known for his songs and albums released in the 1990s, such as 1996's Antichrist Superstar and 1998's Mechanical Animals, which along with his public image earned him a reputation in the mainstream media as a controversial figure and a negative influence on young people. Manson has been ranked number 44 in the Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader, and has been nominated for four Grammy Awards.
Marilyn Manson was born in Canton, Ohio. He is the only son of Barbara Warner (maiden name Wyer) and Hugh Warner.[4] Manson is of German and English descent,[5] and is a fourth cousin, twice removed, of conservative commentator Pat Buchanan.[4][6] In his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, he detailed his grandfather's sexual fetishes, including bestiality and sadomasochism. As a child, he attended his mother's Episcopal church, though his father was a Catholic.[7][8] Warner attended Heritage Christian School from first grade to tenth grade. He later transferred to GlenOak High School[9] and graduated from there in 1987. After relocating with his parents, he became a student at Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1990. He was working towards a degree in journalism and gaining experience in the field by writing articles for a music magazine, 25th Parallel. He soon met several of the musicians to whom his own band were later compared, including My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, The Perfect, and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.
Manson and guitarist Scott Putesky formed Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids following conversations at the Reunion Room in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1989.[10] The name was later shortened to Marilyn Manson. While with The Spooky Kids, Manson was involved with Jeordie White (also known as Twiggy Ramirez) and Stephen Gregory Bier Jr. (also known as Madonna Wayne Gacy) in two side-projects: Satan on Fire, a faux-Christian metal ensemble where he played bass guitar, and drums in Mrs. Scabtree, a collaborative band formed with White and then girlfriend Jessicka (vocalist with the band Jack Off Jill) as a way to combat contractual agreements that prohibited Marilyn Manson from playing in certain clubs. In 1993, the band drew the attention of Trent Reznor. Reznor produced their 1994 debut album, Portrait of an American Family and released it on his Nothing Records label. The band began to develop a cult following, which grew larger on the Downward Spiral Tour that featured Nine Inch Nails and Jim Rose Circus along with the release of Smells Like Children in 1995. That EP yielded the band's first big MTV hit with "Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)," a cover of the 1983 Eurythmics hit. Antichrist Superstar (co-produced by Trent Reznor) was an even greater success.[11]
In the US alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded two platinum and three more went gold, and the band has had seven releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. Manson first worked as a producer with the band Jack Off Jill. He helped name the band and produce most of the band's early recordings, and also played guitar on the song "My Cat" and had the band open most of his South Florida shows.[12] Manson later wrote the liner notes to the band's album Humid Teenage Mediocrity 1992-1995, a collection of early Jack Off Jill recordings. Manson has appeared as a guest performer on DMX's album Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood[13] and on Godhead's 2000 Years of Human Error album — the only album released on his vanity label Posthuman.[14][15] In 2011 it was revealed that Manson was to appear on the singer Skylar Grey's album "Invinsible" on the track entitled "Can't Haunt Me".
Manson made his film debut in 1997, as an actor in David Lynch's Lost Highway. Since then he has appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos, including Party Monster; then-girlfriend Rose McGowan's 1999 film Jawbreaker; Asia Argento's 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things; Rise; The Hire: Beat The Devil, the sixth installment in the BMW Films series; and Showtime's comedy-drama TV series Californication in 2013, in which Manson portrayed himself. He is also currently scheduled to appear on HBO's Eastbound and Down, of which Manson is reportedly a longtime fan, and had lobbied to appear on for years; and ABC's Once Upon a Time, for which he will provide the voice of the character "Shadow".
He was interviewed in Michael Moore's political documentary Bowling for Columbine discussing possible motivations for the Columbine massacre and allegations that his music was somehow a factor. He has appeared in animated form in Clone High and participated in several episodes of the MTV series Celebrity Deathmatch, becoming the show's unofficial champion and mascot; he often performed the voice for his claymated puppet, and contributed the song "Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes" to the soundtrack album. In July 2005, Manson told Rolling Stone that he was shifting his focus from music to filmmaking – "I just don't think the world is worth putting music into right now. I no longer want to make art that other people — particularly record companies — are turning into a product. I just want to make art."
Johnny Depp reportedly used Manson as his inspiration for his performance as Willy Wonka in the film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Manson himself expressed interest in playing the role of Willy Wonka in the film.[16][unreliable source?]
He had been working on his directorial debut, Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll, a project that has been in development hell since 2004, with Manson also set to portray the role of Lewis Carroll, author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Initially announced as a web-only release, it was later decided to give the estimated $4.2 million budget film a conventional cinema release, with a slated release date of mid-2007. The film was to have an original music soundtrack with previously unreleased songs.[17] Production of the film had been postponed indefinitely until after the Eat Me, Drink Me tour.[18] In 2010, studio bosses shut down production on the project, reportedly due to viewers' responses to the violent content of clips released on the internet. The film was later officially put on "indefinite production hold".[19] However, according to an interview with co-writer Anthony Silva about the hold, the film was still on and the talk of it being shut down was just a myth.[20] In a June 2013 interview, Manson stated that he had "resurrected" the project, and that Roger Avary would direct it.[21] In a separate interview during the previous year, he said a small crew similar to what he used for his Slo-Mo-Tion music video would be used, and would rather film the movie on an iPhone than rather not film it at all.
Manson stated in a 2004 interview with i-D magazine to have begun his career as a watercolor painter in 1999 when he made five-minute concept pieces and sold them to drug dealers. On September 13–14, 2002, his first show, The Golden Age of Grotesque, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Centre. Art in America's Max Henry likened them to the works of a "psychiatric patient given materials to use as therapy" and said his work would never be taken seriously in a fine art context, writing that the value was "in their celebrity, not the work".[22] On September 14–15, 2004, Manson held a second exhibition on the first night in Paris and the second in Berlin. The show was named 'Trismegistus' which was also the title of the center piece of the exhibit – a large, three-headed Christ painted onto an antique wood panel from a portable embalmers table.
Manson named his self-proclaimed art movement Celebritarian Corporation. He has coined a slogan for the movement: “We will sell our shadow to those who stand within it.” In 2005 he said that the Celebritarian Corporation has been "incubating for seven years" which if correct would indicate that Celebritarian Corporation, in some form, started in 1998.[23]
Celebritarian Corporation is also the namesake of an art gallery owned by Manson, called the Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art in Los Angeles for which his third exhibition was the inaugural show. From April 2–17, 2007, his recent works were on show at the Space 39 Modern & Contemporary in Florida. 40 pieces from this show traveled to Germany's Gallery Brigitte Schenk in Cologne to be publicly exhibited from June 28 – July 28, 2007. Manson was refused admittance to Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), when he was in the city to attend the opening night. This was, according to Manson, due to his makeup.
Manson revealed a series of 20 paintings in 2010 entitled Genealogies of Pain, an exhibition showcased at Vienna's Kunsthalle gallery[24] which the artist collaborated on with David Lynch.
Manson made an appearance in the video game Area 51 as Edgar, a Grey Alien. His song "Cruci-Fiction In Space" is featured in a commercial for a video game, The Darkness. His likeness is also featured on the Celebrity Deathmatch video game for which he recorded a song for the soundtrack (2003). The song "Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth" was the credits score of the game Cold Fear as well as Spawn: Armageddon. The song "Four Rusted Horses" had an alternate version used in trailers for the video game Fear 3. A remix of the song "Tainted Love" appears in the debut trailer for the game, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and in the launch trailer of Twisted Metal. Manson's song "The Beautiful People" was featured in WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth. The song Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin-Geddon is also featured in Saints Row: The Third.
Manson launched "Mansinthe," his own brand of Swiss-made absinthe, which has received mixed reviews; some critics described the taste as being "just plain",[25] but it came second to Versinthe in an Absinthe top five[26] and won a gold medal at the 2008 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.[27] Other reviewers, such as critics at The Wormwood Society, have given the absinthe moderately high praise.[28]
An energy drink called "Eat Me, Drink Me" was also produced for a limited time, inspired by Marilyn Manson's album of the same name.
Manson was engaged to actress Rose McGowan from February 1998 to January 19, 2001.[29] McGowan later ended their two-year long engagement over "lifestyle differences".
Manson and Dita Von Teese first met when he asked her to dance in one of his music videos. Though she was unable to, the two kept in contact. On his 32nd birthday, in 2001, she arrived with a bottle of absinthe, and they became a couple. Manson proposed on March 22, 2004 and gave her a 1930s, 7-carat, European round-cut diamond engagement ring. On November 28, 2005, Manson and von Teese were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony in their home. A larger ceremony was held on December 3, at Gurteen Castle, in Kilsheelan, County Tipperary, Ireland, the home of their friend, Gottfried Helnwein. The wedding was officiated by the Chilean surrealist film director and comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky.[30] On December 30, 2006, Von Teese filed for divorce due to "irreconcilable differences."[31] ET.com and People claimed that Manson was having an extramarital affair with then 19-year-old actress Evan Rachel Wood, who is to co-star in his horror film Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll, and was featured in the video for his 2007 single, "Heart-Shaped Glasses."[32][33] The relationship was confirmed by Von Teese in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, "I get the impression he thinks I was unsupportive, but the truth is I wasn't supportive of his lifestyle, and someone else came along who was."[34] Manson's alcohol abuse and distant behavior were also cited as cause for the split.[35] A judgment of divorce was entered in Los Angeles Superior Court on December 27, 2007.[36]
In 2007, attention was brought to Manson's love life again when a relationship with Evan Rachel Wood was made public.[37] Manson and Wood reportedly maintained an on-again off-again relationship for several years. Manson proposed to Wood during a Paris stage performance in January 2010, but the couple broke off the engagement later that year.[38]
In the March 2012 issue of Revolver magazine, American photographer Lindsay Usich was referred to as Manson's girlfriend. The article referenced a new painting by Manson featuring Usich. She is credited as the photo source for the cover art of Manson's 2012 album, Born Villain. It was later confirmed that the two were romantically involved.[39][40]
In September 1996, former bassist Gidget Gein negotiated a settlement with Manson where he would receive $17,500 in cash, 20 percent of any royalties paid for recordings and for any songs he had a hand in writing and his share of any other royalties or fees the group earned while he was a member. Furthermore, the settlement allowed him to market himself as a former member of Marilyn Manson. This settlement was not honored, however.[41]
Former guitarist and founding member Scott Putesky (aka Daisy Berkowitz) filed a $15 million lawsuit in a Fort Lauderdale court against the singer, the band and the band's attorney, David Codikow in January 1998 after his forcible departure from the group in the spring of 1996. Berkowitz claimed he was cheated by the band out of "thousands of dollars in royalties, publishing rights, and performance fees." He also filed an attorney malpractice suit against Codikow, alleging that "Codikow represented Warner's interests more than the band's and that he gave Warner disproportionate control over the band's name, recordings, merchandising, and touring proceeds."[42][43] By October of that year, the suit had been settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.[44]
On November 30, 1998, a few days after the band accumulated "[a] total [of] more than $25,000" in backstage and hotel room damages during the Poughkeepsie, New York stop of their Mechanical Animals Tour,[45] SPIN editor Craig Marks filed a $24 million lawsuit against Manson and his bodyguards for allegedly assaulting his person and threatening to kill his family. According to Marks' interview with the New York Post, the issue stemmed from Manson's displeasure with the magazine's decision to renege on a promised cover story of the band for their January 1999 cover. According to Marks, the last-minute change was made because Manson's record wasn't "performing." The Post described the editor as "bruised and battered." Manson for his part issued a statement saying, "I had a conversation with Craig Marks expressing I was tired of Spin's immature business behavior and the series of deals they had broken with me. I told him that I didn't care what he prints or whether or not I'm on the cover. I simply no longer wanted to work with him or his magazine that obviously has a lack of respect for musicians and their fans." On February 19, 1999, Manson counter-sued Marks for libel, slander and defamation. The singer was seeking $40 million in reparation, claiming that Marks' statements were false and "were made ... with actual malice, hatred and personal ill will." According to the counter-suit, Marks' allegations have "greatly damaged and injured [Manson's] reputation and standing in the music profession, in the music and entertainment industries, in his community and in the general public, and has been subjected to great shame, humiliation and indignity."[46] As for the Poughkeepsie incident, Manson apologized and offered to make financial restitution.[47][48]
In a civil battery suit, David Diaz, a security officer from a concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on October 27, 2000, sued for $75,000 in a Minneapolis federal court.[49] The federal court jury found in Manson's favor.[50]
In a civil suit presented by Oakland County, Michigan, Manson was charged with sexual misconduct against another security officer, Joshua Keasler, during a concert in Clarkston, Michigan, on July 30, 2001. Oakland County originally filed assault and battery and criminal sexual misconduct charges,[51] but the judge reduced the latter charge to misdemeanor disorderly conduct.[52] Manson pleaded no contest to the reduced charges, paid a $4,000 fine,[53] and later settled the lawsuit under undisclosed terms.[54]
On April 3, 2002, Maria St. John filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court accusing Manson of providing her adult daughter, Jennifer Syme, with cocaine and instructing her to drive while under the influence.[55] After attending a party at Manson's house, Syme was given a lift home;[56] Manson claims she was taken home by a designated driver.[55] After she got home she got behind the wheel of her own vehicle and was killed instantly when she crashed it into three parked cars. Manson is reported to have said there were no drugs or alcohol at the party. St. John's lawyer asked "[if] there were no drinks, no drugs, why would she need a designated driver?"[55] The suit alleged Syme was returning to the party at Manson's request. The case, BC271111, was dismissed on May 29, 2003.[57]
On August 2, 2007, former band member Stephen Bier filed a lawsuit against Manson for unpaid "partnership proceeds," seeking $20 million in back pay. Several details from the lawsuit leaked to the press.[58][59] In November 2007, additional papers were filed saying that Manson purchased a child's skeleton and masks made of human skin. He also allegedly bought stuffed animals, such as a grizzly bear and two baboons and a collection of Nazi memorabilia.[60] In December 2007, Manson countersued, claiming that Bier failed to fulfill his duties as a bandmember to play for recordings and to promote the band.[61] On December 28, 2009, the suit was settled with an agreement which saw Bier's attorneys being paid a total of $380,000, of which Manson's insurance company paid $175,000, while the remainder was paid by Bier's former business managers, according to Manson's lawyer Howard King.[62]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Marilyn Manson was originally a music journalist before he got into music. He moved to Florida when he was 18 and began to write stories & poems. He tried to get his poems and stories published by various magazines, but continued to be turned down. It was when covering "Nine Inch Nails" for his magazine that Brian Warner was given an opportunity to meet Trent Reznor, who sponsored Warner's upstart band and eventually produced their first three albums (including the E.P. Smells Like Children). Scott Mitchell Putesky (a.k.a. Daisy Berkowitz) originally played lead guitar for the band but was fired during the recording of "Antichrist Superstar". He features on only three songs.
          Marilyn Manson, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, was born on January 5, 1969 in Canton, Ohio to the parents of Hugh and Barb Warner. During his childhood, one of his neighbors molested him several times until the young Brian broke down one day and told his mother what happened. As an only child, he would often get into mischievous activities such as adventure through his grandfather Jack Warner's sex toys, shoot his BB gun with his cousin Chad, and create sex magazines to sell to his classmates. His parents raised him as an Episcopalian, and he attended the religious private Heritage Christian School. It was there that he became fueled with hate towards Christanity. During his tenth grade year, he convinced his parents to let him attend a public school.After he graduated from high school, he and his parents moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida because his father got a better job there. He studied journalism and theater at the local community college called Broward, and being some place new and feeling lonely, he wrote poems and short stories. After being fired from his last job at a record store, he became entertainment journalist for a local magazine. He interviewed several famous musicians including Trent Reznor from the band "Nine Inch Nails". Along with his job and writing, he would also frequently go to rock clubs. He soon decided to create his own band. With musical influences from Ozzy Osbourne and KISS, he recruited other musicians with the same interests and started the band called "Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids". He got the name Marilyn Manson as a combination from the names of the movie star Marilyn Monroe and the psycho killer Charles Manson. The band's name would later officially change to just Mariyn Manson, and most of the original band members would leave and be replaced, too. Manson reunited with Trent Reznor and had his band tour with "Nine Inch Nails". Reznor would also produce Marilyn Manson's first three albums (Portriat of an American Family, AntiChrist Superstar, and Mechanical Animals) and an E.P. (Smells like Children). "Mechanical Animals" is Marilyn Manson's most successful album to date.With the success, Manson became a controversial celebrity, because the anti-Christian message in his songs, and Satanist 'Anton Szandor LaVey' deemed Manson a Reverend for the Church of Satan. Also with fame, Manson started to mingle with other celebrities, and began a romantic relationship with the actress Rose McGowan. They became engaged, but broke off the relationship in 2001. He then fell in love with the burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese, and soon became engaged. They had a fairytale, non-denominational wedding in a castle in Ireland. Meanwhile, Manson came out with two more albums (Holy Wood, and the Golden Age of Grotesque), and a best of album (Lest We Forget: The Best Of...). He also dabbled into acting by being in such movies as Jawbreaker (1999), Party Monster (1998) and The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (2004). He continues to make music and act in movies.
      His name comes from com-binding the first name of famed move starlet - Marilyn Monroe - and the last name of infamous cult leader/mass murderer - Charles Manson.
      He has a collection of medical prosthetics (artificial limbs, glass eyes, etc.) and vintage metal lunch boxes.
      Has displayed (and sold some of) his watercolor paintings at The Los Angeles Contemporary Exihibtions museum. Some of his buyers were Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nicolas Cage and Jack Osbourne.
      The cover of the Mechanical Animals CD was edited in Japan because it showed Mr. Manson with 6 fingers on his left hand and NOT because he was "naked."
      The cover of the Mechanical Animals CD caused the album to be banned from many stores because it showed Mr. Manson as a naked alien.
      Director David Lynch had a recurring role planned for him, once Mulholland Dr. (2001) went into series production. Of course the TV show never happened and Lynch made an award winning big screen film out of the planned pilot episode.
      His 1996 album "Antichrist Superstar" came fifth in Classic Rock Magazine's list of the 30 greatest concept albums of all time. [March 2003]
      Was originally approached to do the musical score of the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" but had to drop out at the last minute due to schedule complications resulting from the release of The Golden Age of Grotesque.
      His album, The Golden Age of Grotesque debuted at #1 on the charts in the US and all over Europe. It is his second album to debut at #1. The Album "Mechanical Animals" debuted at # 1 on Billboard in 1998.
      In Mexico people joke about his name by calling him "Marilyn Menson" it means "Marilyn The Dumber".

      The burden of originality is one that most people don't want to accept. They'd rather sit in front of the TV and let that tell them what they're supposed to like, what they're supposed to buy, and what they're supposed to laugh at. You have Beavis and Butt-head telling you what music you're allowed to like and not like, and you've got sitcoms that have canned laughter that lets you know when to laugh if you're too stupid to know when the joke is--people are too lazy and too stupid to think for themselves because America has raised them like that.
      Find out what's really out there. I never said to be like me, I say be like you and make a difference.
      This is the culture you're raising your kids in. Don't be surprised if it blows up in your face.
      When people say 'I want to be like you', I tell them if you want to be like me, then be yourself.
      Im not saying that when I perform I'm Barry Manilow, but I'm also not killing kids and beating up dogs and things like that.
      I view my job as being someone who is supposed to piss people off. I don't want to be just one-of-the-guys. I don't want to be just a smiling face you see on television presenting some vapid kind of easily-digestible garbage. This is rock and roll. I want to be a rock and roll star! Rock and roll is about shaking things up, making people act and react. That's what I do.
      We've always found that with people being so desensitized, things have to be really shocking and have to punch you in the face to get your attention. Then, once you've got their attention. You can say something they might remember.
      I picked that (Marilyn Manson) as the fakest stage name of all to say that this is what show business is, fake. Marilyn Monroe wasn't even her real name, Charles Manson isn't his real name, and now, I'm taking that to be my real name. But what's real? You can't find the truth, you just pick the lie you like the best. As long as you know everything's a lie, you can't hurt yourself.
      Billy Zane is someone that I met and is a fellow artist, and sometimes we work together, painting, however pretentious that might sound. It was really quite simple, though. We would just spend time together, hanging out, listening to music, or painting. We became friends. He was one of the first people I met when I moved to Hollywood. And I think he's a cool actor.
      I've always had the same level of excitement about making music, but now it seems so much more important because all of the blame that was put on me for Columbine. The entire incident, the way the media reacted, the people who were involved, the way I was treated, it hurt me personally because my career is my life. It made me feel a lot like how I felt growing up because it was a lot of people beating you down and treating you a certain way for something you're not even responsible for. I just really had to re-evaluate what I was gonna do; How am I gonna respond to this, how am I gonna take this? And I wanted to come out swinging with both fists.
      It is a great feeling to write a song, but to be able to perform it, it takes on a whole different light.
      "If Mandy [Mandy Moore] and I had a love child (if she was old enough) this is what they'd look like." - referring to The Polyphonic Spree at the MTV Video Music Awards 2004 (2004).
      I've always watched pop-culture shows, and I found out when I thought about this, Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson were the two most memorable people from the sixties, and I found it interesting that things like pop-culture shows put them on the same kind of celebrity status, and I thought that dichotomy of positive and negative, putting those two names together, represented what I had to say and what I was about. (On where the name, Marilyn Manson, came from.)
      [on a period where his career faltered] I felt I wasn't able to live up to what I am supposed to be. I lost interest. That was the problem. The edge comes with the desire. I'm like a knife. You're either a butcher knife or a butter knife. It takes longer to cut off your dick with a butter knife. That's what I was. I don't know where that metaphor came from, but I'm sticking with it.
      [on people partly linking the Columbine shooting to his music]I got blamed for something I had nothing to do with. It wasn't right, and it hurt, hurt me personally, and hurt my career.
      I think the only thing you can be in today's world is chaos and confusion. You can't be shocking. The minute Kennedy was shot on color on TV, you can't be shocking. You can be chaos. And confusion is what brings the interest, the attention.

Drawing inspiration from Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, David Bowie, the occult, horror comics, and (by his own account) the King James Bible, Marilyn Manson established himself in the Nineties as one of the most vilified figures in rock history. Predictably, the more parental groups, politicians and religious advocates protested his music and stage antics, the more popular he became—not only as a musician, but as a martyr in the war against censorship. Charismatic and outspoken, he defended himself as a result of, rather than a cause of, a corrupt society.
Manson was born and raised Brian Hugh Warner in a middle-class family in Canton, Ohio. He was close to his parents but chafed at the ideologies and rules of his private Christian school. Seduced by rock during lectures about alleged evil messages embedded in the music, he took to rebellion and was expelled. Finishing at a public high school, he moved to South Florida with his family, and formed Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids in 1989 after a short stint in rock journalism. Each member of the group—Daisy Berkowitz, Olivia Newton Bundy, Madonna Wayne Gacy, and, soon, Twiggy Ramirez—adopted a stage name patterned after Manson's, a female icon's first name crossed with a serial killer's last.
The band self-produced a series of cassettes and attracted the attention of Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, who signed them to Nothing, his Interscope imprint, in 1993. The following year, Reznor produced the group's industrial-metal debut, Portrait of an American Family, and took the band on tour with NIN. There, Manson wasted little time securing his status as a nightmare to the Christian right, exposing himself and feigning sexual acts onstage with other band members (He was arrested after one show in Florida.) He was made a "reverend" of the Church of Satan by founder Anton LaVey, though Manson would later note that he was as much a practicing Satanist as he was a practicing Christian, since he had also been baptized.
Nonetheless, the controversy—and a radio hit with a hard-rock cover of Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams"—pushed the 1995 EP Smells Like Children to Number 31 and (eventually) platinum sales. With Antichrist Superstar (Number Three, 1996), Manson became a star. A brutally aggressive concept album about a nihilistic rock god, it spawned two singles that reached the Mainstream Rock chart—"Beautiful People" (Number 29) and "Tourniquet" (Number 30)—and a stage show in which Manson ripped pages out of a Bible. Fueled by (false) rumors that the shows contained animal sacrifices, bestiality and rape, activist groups across America lobbied to ban the group's performances. In the midst of the furor, Manson cowrote an autobiography, The Long Road Out of Hell, with rock journalist Neil Strauss, in 1997, the same year as the Remix & Repent EP (Number 102) and his big-screen debut in David Lynch's Lost Highway.
For Mechanical Animals (Number One, 1998), Manson adopted a new persona, an androgynous, Ziggy Stardust-style glam rocker, Omega. He explained to interviewers that Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals were part of a pseudoautobiographical trilogy, told in reverse order, with Mechanical Animals intended as a satire in which the protagonist's revolution becomes "sold out."
The album went platinum like Antichrist Superstar before it—and lead single "The Dope Show" was the first MM single to hit the pop chart (Number 122)¬—but the accompanying tour was derailed when Manson's music was blamed, along with violent video games, as a negative influence on the two teenage boys responsible for the Columine High School massacre in April 1999. Manson canceled several concert dates in light of the tragedy but vehemently distanced himself from it, decrying the killings as well as allegations that his or anyone else's music was responsible for the murders. (He appeared in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary Bowling for Columbine to discuss violence and the media.)
After a live album, The Last Tour on Earth (Number 82, 1999), Mason returned in 2000 with the final part of his trilogy, Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) (Number 13). Telling the story of the future antichrist superstar's origins before his corruption, the album ditched the glam-rock sound of Mechanical Animals for a return to heavy, industrialized goth rock.
Twiggy Ramirez left the band soon thereafter due to creative differences, but Manson continued on with The Golden Age of Grotesque (Number One, 2003), which was heavily influenced by Weimar-era Berlin and produced a Grammy-nominated single, "Mobscene." A best-of, Lest We Forget, followed a year later. By this time, the edge had slightly worn off of Manson's persona: The Onion satirized the rocker with the headline "Marilyn Manson Now Going Door-to-Door Trying to Shock People.
He'd become more famous for his relationships: a brief engagement to actress Rose McGowan, a short-lived marriage to neo-burlesque queen Dita Von Teese and subsequent canoodling with 19-year-old actress Evan Rachel Wood, who appeared in the video for "Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)," the first single from his 2007 album Eat Me, Drink Me (Number Eight). Manson reunited with Twiggy Ramirez for the album's Rape of the World Tour, citing Led Zeppelin's 2007 reunion as an inspiration.
Manson, who started producing his own brand of absinthe, has been working on the film Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll, about the fantastical children's author, for several years (he is directing and starring in the lead role).
In May, 2009, the band released their seventh studio album, The High End of Low, which debuted at Number Four, but sold just 45,000 copies its first week, a worse debut than any of their previous studio albums. In December, 2009, the band broke with longtime label, Interscope, with Manson suggesting that break would free him from constraints on his creativity.

=======================================================
Frontman, Singer. Real Name: Brian Hugh Warner. Born: 5th January 1969, Canton, Ohio, USA at Timkin Mercy Hospital. Baptized in St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Canton. 
From a middle-America family background, Brian's parents considered he'd get the best education at Heritage Christian School in Ohio. However, the fear instilled there in a sensitive youngster by certain, 'educators', was a strong influence in shaping his later attitudes and behaviour.
The more they terrorized him about what to avoid in life (or be forever damned) and how to conform to their extreme version of Christian doctrine, the more he was attracted to expressing his individuality and seeking out the taboos they had so clearly identified. They should've seen it coming shouldn't they?
Convinced by one particular teacher that the end of the world was nigh, he suffered from nightmares but finally realized he'd been had. That's when he also realized the value of thinking things through for yourself, seeking your own answers and helping others to do the same. Marilyn Manson was nigh...
He joined a new school in Canton, GlenOak High, graduating in 1987, then moved with his family to Florida. There he studied Journalism and Theatre at Broward Community College. It was an upheaval for the 18 year old to leave friends and familiar surroundings behind in Ohio but, after the first year in his new hometown, Fort Lauderdale, he began to find his way again.
Whilst at college, Brian/Manson was Assistant Entertainment Editor for Broward's student paper, The Observer. After college, he successfully applied to be a Staff Writer at Fort Lauderdale's 25th Parallel Magazine,  later advancing to Associate Editor.
Around this time, he was also taking his first steps to forming a band, christening it Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids. The 'Spooky Kids' part of the name was dropped in 1992.
In his book, Marilyn said part of the reason he adopted the Marilyn Manson persona was because, as a music-critic, he wanted an alias to perform under so that he could write about his own band! Marilyn's stage name is taken from Marilyn Monroe the Hollywood filmstar and Charles Manson the infamous 'guru' to a group of 1960s killers.
The name really describes everything that I have to say. Male and female, beauty and ugliness, and it's very American. It's a statement on the power that we give to icons like Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. It's about paradox - diametrically opposed archetypes.
Whilst a journalist, he interviewed Trent Reznor of the industrial metal band Nine Inch Nails. Trent became a role model for Brian and also a close friend. They fell out after Antichrist Superstar was recorded but did come to their senses again. But now they can't decide.
After playing as openers for NIN one night in July 1990, Manson hands Reznor one of their self-made promo tapes. Trent must have liked it well enough.
Aside from Mr Reznor and naked ambition (that sounds a bit homo-erotic but you know what I mean), Manson once cited rap group 2 Live Crew as his biggest influence to actually starting a band. Best known for their explicit lyrics and attitude, 2 Live Crew were often in the news. This set him thinking about whose buttons he could push with his own band, as well as all the other things he could achieve.
Early musical influences for him include: The Beatles, KISS, Alice Cooper, AC/DC, Iggy Pop, Black Sabbath, David Bowie and Gary Numan. He said his first memories of music were of The Beatles' White Album on his parents 8-track. The White Album was one of the first records to be implicated in later violent acts - just as Marilyn's work has been. Jim Morrison's life, work and attitude had a great effect on him too.
In 1979, he saw his first live show: Kiss on their 'Die-nasty' tour. His dad, Hugh - dressed like Gene Simmons complete with Kiss facepaint - took him to the show. The 'Alive' album by Kiss was the first  one he ever bought. 
Non-musical influences? The 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is certainly one. In February 2001 he said of it:
It's a great movie. If they remake it and ruin it, I'm gonna be very upset, unless I get to play Willy Wonka, because I could play that role like nobody else could.
I really see that movie as a metaphor. I see Willy Wonka as satan because he presents people with the temptation of picking good and evil, and they all pick evil. It's such a powerful statement to put into a children's film. The chocolate's a metaphor for sin. He's always tempting them with that and they always pick the bad thing. That just shows you man's nature.
[Charlie and his grandfather] redeem themselves. Charlie wasn't giving up the Gobstopper so that he would win the chocolate factory, he was giving it up because he thought it was the right thing to do. He did a good deed that didn't revolve around his own greed. He actually did an honest deed, which is a rare thing. It had a beautiful message.
Literary references for him include, "philosophers like Nietzche, Freud, Darwin, Crowley, LaVey, Roald Dahl, Dr. Seuss, and even the King James Version of the Holy Bible."
Before forming the band, his first public performances were  at the Squeeze club in Fort Lauderdale, reading his own poetry at open-mike spots. Favourable comments from regulars encouraged him to do more and, soon after meeting guitarist Scott Mitchell Putesky (Daisy Berkowitz), they were experimenting musically.
They were briefly joined by Brian Tutunick (Olivia Newton-Bundy), a friend from theatre class, and Perry Pandrea (Zsa Zsa Speck). Perry was the original keyboardist but both he and bassist Brian Tutunick only played a few of the very first shows. Stephen Bier (Madonna Wayne-Gacy or Pogo) took over on keyboards and Brad Stewart became new bass player, Gidget Gein.
Marilyn met Jeordie White soon after this but it was several years before Jeordie was to join the band as Twiggy Ramirez, taking over from Gidget.
Manson soon tired of the drum machine and, in July 1990, enlisted drummer, Freddie Streithorst (Sarah Lee Lucas). But after four years of steady improvement as a band, Marilyn decided that Freddie just hadn't kept up. And so, at the end of the show on 10 March 1995, he sprayed lighter fluid over Freddie's drums, setting them and the drummer alight. Freddie took the hint but returned to play the next night's show, the final one of the tour. What a trooper!
Throughout the 1990s, Marilyn became notorious for inflicting damage onstage to equipment and band members.  Freddie's replacement, Kenny Wilson ('Ginger Fish'), has suffered most often. Ginger's mum should've boxed Manson's ears. At least some of the set-trashing and missile throwing is attributable to Marilyn's temper tantrums when things don't go to plan - he describes himself as a perfectionist after all.
Now I'm not sure when this happened but because he thought his earlobes to be too large, he had surgery to have them reduced. I've looked at older photos and they seem okay to me but he must have felt convinced that they needed 'trimmed'.
The early part of Manson's career contains what I think of as his cat-in-the-hat 'cartoon satanism' phase. But - following the release of Portrait of an American Family and Smells Like Children - it was to lead on to something more diabolically focussed than ever.

In the mid 80's a teenager named Brian Warner moved to a new town, and began to meet with a youth group at a local church. He was sort of an awkward kid, a little different, and no one really wanted to talk to him.
The youth pastor would go over to him, and do the usual pastor thing, you know, "how are you, that's good" and then move on to talk to the other more popular kids. The pastor didn't need to concern himself with Brian, after all, before moving to town; Brian had attended a Christian school all his life up to the 8th grade.
One day, they went to an amusement park and the pastor wanted them to be in pairs, but NO ONE wanted to pair with Brian, so he walked the amusement park by himself. The pastor didn't think he needed to talk to Brian that day because he knew Brian had been raised in the church. Brian stayed in the youth group for about 3 months, and one day he just stopped coming.
Several years later, the youth pastor had become a leader of a seminary, and one of his former students called his old youth pastor one day, and asked him if he remembered a kid named Brian Warner. The pastor had to think a minute, then said he kind of remembered the name, but that was all. The caller reminded the pastor about the kid who was awkward, that no one liked, and suddenly the pastor recalled who he was. The guy asked the  former youth pastor, "Do you know who he is now?"  The pastor said, "No," and the guy gave him a hint, "He doesn't go by Brian anymore." The pastor was baffled, "Well, who is he then?"
This is a true story. As you can tell, the boy in this story, Brian, was shunned by the "Christians" in the youth group. If he had been accepted into the group, he might not be what he is today. He is a hurt individual. Regardless of his actions, he still has feelings, and truly believes that this youth group is what Christianity is all about. If some could reach him, maybe, just maybe, he could be able to bring millions of teenagers into Heaven, instead of leading down the road to hell. Just something to think about.
Send this to all your friends. Let them know that no matter how weird or awkward the person may seem, never, ever be a snob towards them, they need your love.
Origins:   We hate to waste a fine moral ("Be kind to even the geeky ones lest they enter Satan's service"), but the facts of Marilyn Manson's life just don't support the construct this e-mail puts upon them. Yes, Marilyn Manson's real name is Brian Warner. But that's where the facts and this story part company
Brian Warner was born on 5 January 1969 in Canton, Ohio. In 1974 his parents enrolled him in Heritage Christian School, where he remained until 10th grade. The family was not overly religious, and neither of two Marilyn 
Manson biographies mentions churchgoing as anything the family or Brian by himself engaged in. The unusual choice of school was dictated by his parents' belief Heritage was a better institution than any of the local public schools and that young Brian would get a better education there.
Brian and the oppressive nature of this particular Christian school did not mix. His memories of those years are replete with incidents of those in charge telling the kids they were going straight to hell and of warring with various members of the faculty over his choice of music. (Brian once had an AC/DC album confiscated by an irate teacher.)
By 10th Grade, Brian had persuaded his parents Heritage was not the best choice for him. He was enrolled in Glen Oak, a public high school in Canton, graduating from it in 1987 at age 18.
Shortly after finishing high school, Brian and his family moved to Pompano Beach, Florida. They were there a short while before settling in nearby Boca Raton. In 1989, Brian founded Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids. (The group changed its name to plain old Marilyn Manson in 1992).
So much for the facts of Brian's pre-Marilyn days; now let's see how they mesh with the parable being circulated in e-mail.
In the mid 80's a teenager named Brian Warner moved to a new town, and began to meet with a youth group at a local church.
Brian and his family moved to Florida in 1987. Never a churchgoer to begin with, the years at Heritage had disillusioned Brian about Christianity and those who professed it. By this point in his life, his music had come to mean a great deal to him, and he'd had to deal with too many angry Christians over his musical choices for it to be at all reasonable to assume he'd seek out the company of some to hang out with. Mainstream church group teens would have had little in common with 18-year-old Brian Warner, and he even less with them.
Manson describes his adolescence and how he came to music in his 1998 autobiography, The Long Hard Road Out of Hell: 
For the most part, I didn't bother to excel at school. Most of my education took place after class, when I escaped into a fantasy world - immersed in role-playing games, reading books like the Jim Morrison bio No One Here Gets Out Alive, writing macabre poems and short stories, and listening to records. I began to appreciate music as a universal healer, an entryway to a place where I could be accepted, a place with no rules and no judgments. 
Put simply, while in high school in Canton, Warner's patterns of macabre self expression were already well established. Though it might satisfy some to believe otherwise, even if he had been part of a Christian youth group years later in Florida and even if he 
had walked away from it because he felt he wasn't wanted, such an experience wouldn't have caused Brian to become Marilyn Manson. The importance of music in his life and what he would write about were already part of him long before he reached 18 and his family moved to Florida.
Neither of the two Marilyn Manson biographies, nor any of his innumerable newspaper and magazine interviews make mention of his being part of a Christian youth group at any time in his life. Surely had he taken part in an activity so against his grain for the length of time this e-mail indicates ("Brian stayed in the youth group for about 3 months") he would not have failed to mention it. Religious images and anti-Christian rants play too much a part of his music for it to be reasonable to assume he'd fail to mention having turned to a Christian youth group for solace and having been rejected by its members.
The case against this Internet parable is compelling, and the case for it nonexistent. The town this supposedly took place in is not named, nor is the pastor or the "local church" the youth group was part of. Not even an approximate date for the incident is given. With all that weighing against it and nothing for it, it's impossible to view this tale as anything other than a "be kind to others" caution dressed up as a true story. 
Marilyn Manson was the parental nightmare of the 1990s in the same way Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper were for earlier decades. As such a controversial figure, a number of "bad boy rocker" legends previously attributed to Osbourne or Cooper have come to feature Manson.  (See our Wondering About Marilyn page for the rumor about his being the kid in television's The Wonder Years and our Dead Puppies page for the legend about his tossing live puppies to the audience and instructing them to tear the little dogs apart if they want him to go on with the show.)

As you might have guessed, this guy wasn't born Marilyn Manson. His real name is Brian Hugh Warner and he grew up in Canton, Ohio. Although there is little reported about Brian Warner's life before he became Marilyn Manson, he seems to have been pretty normal. At least we know he had normal fears, because Brian Warner basically admitted he would have been scared of his Marilyn Manson persona when he was younger, stating, "I've grown up to become the things that hurt and scared me." 
By the time Brian Warner was 18 he had developed creative passions for writing and music. Brian was also very intrigued by the freedom of speech/censorship debate. Brian moved to Florida and worked as a part-time music journalist and began to write poems and stories. It was while he was living in Florida that Brian met up with Scott Mitchell, a guitarist. Mitchell became the first member of Brian's band, Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids. The point of the band, for Brian Warner, was to push the limits of American censorship laws.
Brian Warner chose the name Marilyn Manson based on actress Marilyn Monroe and murderer Charles Manson. Of his new name, Brian Warner says, "I picked that as the fakest stage name of all to say that this is what show business is, fake."  The Spooky Kids (Marilyn's band) decided to follow Manson's lead and they all chose famous female first names paired with serial killer last names. The band's original line-up included guitarist Daisy Berkowitz, bassist Olivia Newton-Bundy, the drummer Sara Lee Lucas and the keyboardist Zsa Zsa Speck. They've become one of the most controversial bands in history.
Marilyn Manson is not well liked by some people, and has been protested just about everywhere he plays. Despite having an over-the-top public image and some controversial lyrics and stage shows, Marilyn has managed to make a name for himself as a serious artist. He's contributed songs to blockbuster movies like The Matrix Reloaded, Bowling for Columbine, From Hell and Resident Evil. Marilyn Manson has also appeared on the big screen in movies like Party Monster and Bowling for Columbine.
Marilyn Manson was engaged to Charmed star Rose McGowan from 1998 'til 2001 but the two never married.
Marilyn is also an accomplished painter and has sold some of his water colors to Nicholas Cage and Jack Osbourne.

Brian Hugh Warner (born January 5, 1969), better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson, is an American musician, artist and former music journalist known for his controversial stage persona and image as the lead singer of the eponymous band, Marilyn Manson. His stage name was formed from juxtaposing the names of two 1960s American cultural icons, namely, actress Marilyn Monroe and convicted multiple murder mastermind[1] Charles Manson as a critical and, simultaneously, laudatory appraisal of America and its culture.[2][3] He has a long legacy of being depicted in the media as a detrimental influence on young people. The seemingly outrageous styles for which he models and the controversy surrounding his lyrics have led to his very pronounced public appeal.[4]
Brian Hugh Warner was born on January 5, 1969 in Canton, Ohio, the only child of Barb (née Wyer) and Hugh Warner. He is of German descent on his father's side, and is a 4th cousin twice removed of Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan.[5][6] As a child, he attended his mother's Episcopalian church, though his father was Catholic.[7][8] Manson attended Heritage Christian School from first grade to tenth grade where he experienced traumatic brainwashing at the hands of his Christian pedagogues by way of their apocalyptic biblical narratives. Ultimately, out of fear, this led to his own personal rebellion against Christianity, and religious conformity in general. In a quote from Manson's autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, he states: "I was thoroughly terrified by the idea of the end of the world and the Antichrist. So I became obsessed with it, watching movies like The Exorcist and the Omen and reading prophetic books like Centuries by Nostradamus, 1984 by George Orwell, and the novelized version of the film a Thief in the Night."
Manson's interest in rock 'n roll music stemmed from a childhood friend who introduced him to bands such as Kiss, Dio, Black Sabbath, and Rainbow and other bands of that genre. Out of these bands, KISS stood out amongst the crowd, Manson was a card-carrying member of the KISS ARMY and attended his first concert with his father in 1979. At the age of ten, a young Brian Warner was photographed in the make-up of KISS drummer, Peter Criss. It has been thought, though never confirmed or denied by Manson that his stage theatrics and make-up partially stem from his influence by KISS as a child.
According to his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, Warner is of German and Polish ancestry on his father's side. Raised in his mother's religion, and attending Heritage Christian School, he later transferred to and graduated from Glen Oak High School in 1987. In 1990, as a college student, Warner attended Broward Community College. As the assistant entertainment editor of BCC's student newspaper, the Observer, his first published article was a review titled "Jane's Addiction returns to shock crowd at Woody's."  Warner was working toward a degree in journalism and theater, though never came into fruition. Manson later lied a local magazine to gain employment and experience in the field by writing music articles for the South Florida lifestyle magazine, 25th Parallel. There he met several of the musicians to whom his own band would later be compared, including My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Manson mentions briefly in his autobiography that he became a musician partly because he wanted writers to gain the same amount of fame and respect as musicians.
Warner's first serious relationship was with Michele Greenberg aka Rachelle, According to Manson's book "The Long Hard Road Out of Hell", the demise of the relationship with Michele Greenberg and his vow to become famous, and the desire to make Michele regret ending the relationship, The Spooky Kids were born. Manson then began dating Melissa Romero as explained in his autobiography, during the production of "Antichrist Superstar," Missi became pregnant with Warner's child, but had an abortion during her second trimester. He has also been linked to Traci Lords and Jenna Jameson. Jameson wrote about her sexual encounter with Manson in her autobiography, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale in which she noted him as being "massively endowed".
Manson was engaged to actress Rose McGowan, but their relationship ended in December 2000, when she broke up with him, claiming the reason of the breakup was "Manson's lifestyle".
Manson had been a long time fan of Dita Von Teese, and was a member of her website. They first met when he asked her to dance in one of his music videos. Though she was unable to, the two kept in contact. On his thirty-second birthday, she arrived with a bottle of absinthe, and they became a couple. Manson photographed Von Teese for the December 2002 issue of Playboy. He proposed on March 22, 2004 and gave her a 1930s-era, 7-carat, European round-cut diamond engagement ring.
On November 28, 2005, Manson and Von Teese were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony in their home. A larger ceremony was held on December 3 at Gurteen Castle in Kilsheelan, County Tipperary, Ireland, the home of their friend, Gottfried Helnwein. The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director and comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky. They reportedly exchanged vows in front of approximately 60 guests, including burlesque performer Catherine D'lish, Lisa Marie Presley, Eric Szmanda, Jessicka and Christian Hejnal. The bride wore a royal purple silk taffeta gown, made by Vivienne Westwood, a tri-corned hat designed by Stephen Jones and a matching Mr. Pearl corset. Moschino designed an additional wardrobe for the rest of the weekend, exclusively for Von Teese. The reception music was provided by the retro German band Palast Orchester mit Max Raabe. Guests were invited to participate in skeet shooting, archery and falconry in the days following the wedding. The wedding pictures appeared in the March 2006 edition of Vogue under the heading "The Bride Wore Purple". Just before his own wedding, Manson criticized Britney Spears' wedding to Kevin Federline, in which they celebrated by wearing personalized tracksuits: "If you're going to do something like getting married, it should have a sense of celebration to it. It should be grand and not in tracksuits!" Vogue magazine featured the wedding in their March 2006 edition[9].
On December 30, 2006, Von Teese filed for divorce due to "irreconcilable differences". ET.com and People claimed that Manson was having an extramarital affair with then 19-year-old actress Evan Rachel Wood, who is to co-star in his upcoming horror film Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll, and features in the video for his 2007 single, "Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)". The relationship was confirmed by Von Teese in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, "I get the impression he thinks I was unsupportive, but the truth is I wasn't supportive of his lifestyle, and someone else came along who was." Manson's alcohol abuse and distant behavior were also cited as cause for the split. It has also been claimed that Manson was not aware of Von Teese's filing for divorce and moving out of their home at the time that the story was published, conceivably due to his reported stay in Paris, France. Von Teese took their two cats and two dachshunds, Greta and Eva, with her when she left; Manson reportedly fought for custody of the couple's cats, but only received one of them.
In April of 2007, Marilyn Manson's girlfriend, Evan Rachel Wood, admitted that they were actually a couple. By the end of the year, on December 27, 2007 a judgment of divorce between Manson and Von Teese was entered into Los Angeles Superior Court. On November 5, 2008, it was reported that Manson and Wood have since ended their nearly two-year relationship as of October 23. On November 7, it was announced that Evan and Manson did not end their relationship and that they took time off to concentrate on their work. On December 4, 2008, Manson had been seen with a new girlfriend, the fashion model Isani Griffith during the Art Basel art exhibition in Miami Beach, Florida. It was announced that they have been dating since Manson's breakup with Wood. As stated by Marilyn Manson on December 24th 2008, 
 Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to make an announcement. The rumors that I found a 'replacement' for Evan, or that I have a new girlfriend are absolutely not true. I am finishing up my album, and I also have never even met Ne-Yo. I can assure him that he would not want to be associated with something this godless. Get over the holiday so I can happily ruin the new year for anyone that assumed music was going to stay boring and sweet. [10]
The relationship with Wood ended and Manson then confirmed that he was dating pornographic actress and model Stoya. Following the release of his controversial music video Running to the Edge of the World, Manson reportedly proposed to Evan on stage December 21, 2009, in Paris during his last performance of The High End of Low Tour.[11] However, Manson and Evan Rachel Wood separated again in August, 2010. 
After separating from Evan, Manson has been linked to several women, more recently, photographer Lindsay Usich who is currently accompanying him on tour.
After meeting Stephen Gregory Bier, Jr. (also known as Madonna Wayne Gacy) at the Kitchen Club in South Beach, Miami the two became close friends, going to concerts and poetry readings. After a short period of time the two began compiling poetry that Manson had written and hoped to turn into songs, it was at this time that Manson instructed Pogo to buy a keyboard and they would start a band. Unfortunately, Stephen was not a part of the first incarnation of what would later become known as Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids. It was not until Manson met Jeordie White (also known as Twiggy Ramirez), who was working at a local record shop at the time. The two created Satan on Fire, a faux-Christian death metal ensemble that was more of a joke than an actual band. At that time, Twiggy was a member of the band Amboog-a-lard and thus Manson recruited college friend Brian Tutunick (also known as Olivia-Newton Bundy) as a bass player, though Tutunick would only last two nights and was later replaced by Brad Stewart (also known as Gidget Gein). Scott Putesky (also known as Daisy Berkowitz) would complete the Spooky Kids line up. With Bier, still not with an instrument, appearing as part of the stage show by playing with toy soldiers.
After developing a cult following on Florida's underground music scene, the band drew the attention of Trent Reznor in the summer of 1993. Reznor produced their 1994 debut album, Portrait of an American Family and released it on his Nothing Records label. The band then began to develop a cult following, which grew larger following the release of Smells Like Children in 1995. That EP yielded the band's first big MTV hit "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", a cover of the 1983 Eurythmics song. Antichrist Superstar (co-produced by Trent Reznor) was to be an even greater success. In the United States alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded platinum certification, and another three gold. the band has had six releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums.
Manson first worked as a producer with long time friend Jessicka and the band Jack Off Jill. He helped name the band and produce most of the band's early recordings. Manson also played guitar on the song "My Cat" and had the band open for most of his South Florida shows. Manson later wrote the liner notes to the band's album Humid Teenage Mediocrity 1992-1995, a collection of early Jack Off Jill recordings.
Manson has appeared as a guest performer on DMX's album  of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood and on gODHEAD's 2000 Years of Human Error album — the only album released on his vanity label Posthuman Records.
Manson has helped or provided full music scores for several major motion pictures, although several of his pieces have been cut, and his name dropped from the credits. Some of his more notable soundtrack score contributions include The Matrix, From Hell and Resident Evil.
After releasing what Manson asserted to be his "farewell album", Lest We Forget (The Best of), Manson's took up another musical project covering the Danny Elfman song, "This Is Halloween". This was included on The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack reissue's bonus disc in October 2006. Shortly after this, he and Tim Skold embarked on recording the sixth Marilyn Manson album Eat Me, Drink Me. Manson has clearly refuted suggestions that the band will collapse, as evidenced by the revitalization of his friendship with Twiggy Ramirez and the recent recording of the album, The High End of Low.
Since late 2009, the band was dropped by Interscope after being on the label for close to 15 years. Subsequent recording on a new album, Born Villain had also begun.
Announced in November, 2010, Marilyn Manson signed with independent European label Cooking Vinyl in a joint venture with his own label Hell, etc. to produce his eighth studio album, with the option for another.
Manson made his acting debut in 1997, appearing in David Lynch's film Lost Highway as Pornstar #1. Since then he has appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos, including Party Monster; then-girlfriend Rose McGowan's 1998 film Jawbreaker; Asia Argento's 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things; Rise: Bloodhunter; and The Hire: Beat the Devil, the sixth installment in the BMW Films series. He was interviewed in Michael Moore's political documentary Bowling for Columbine discussing possible motivations for the Columbine massacre and allegations that his music was somehow a factor. He has appeared in animated form in Clone High and participated in several episodes of the MTV series Celebrity Deathmatch, becoming the show's unofficial champion and mascot; he often performed the voice for his claymated puppet, and contributed the song "Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes" to the soundtrack album. 
In July 2005, Manson told Rolling Stone that he was shifting his focus from music to film making - "I just don't think the world is worth putting music into right now. I no longer want to make art that other people – particularly record companies – are turning into a product. I just want to make art."
Manson has made several cameo appearances in music videos for the Murderdolls' Dead in Hollywood, Nine Inch Nails' Gave Up, Starfuckers Inc. and Eminem's The Way I Am. He has also produced 23 music videos, most of which have gone beyond the scope of a normal performance video and been well received by critics for their imagery and direction. Three of Manson's more recently released videos, "Personal Jesus", "(s)AINT" and "Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)", were voluntarily funded with his own money (to a sum of $1,500,000) and largely not that of the record label. Manson stated in June 2006 that he saw himself "as more a student of film than of music."
From the beginning Manson has been a recreational painter, the oldest of his surviving pieces dating back to 1995–1996, but it was after his 1998 Grey period that Manson began his career as a watercolor painter, claiming in a 2004 interview with i-D magazine to have begun his career as such when in 1999, he made five-minute concept pieces and sold them to drug dealers. Gradually Manson became more drawn to watercolors as an art form in itself, and instead of trading them, kept them and continued to paint at a proficient rate. On September 13-14, 2002, his first show, The Golden Age of Grotesque, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Centre. Art in America's Max Henry likened them to the works of a "psychiatric patient given materials to use as therapy" and said his work would never be taken seriously in a fine-art context, writing that the value was "in their celebrity, not the work". On September 14-15, 2004, Manson held a second exhibition on the first night in Paris and the second in Berlin. The show was named Trismegistus which was also the title of the center piece of the exhibit – a large, three-headed Christ painted onto an antique wood panel from a portable embalmer's table.
Manson named his self-proclaimed art movement the Celebritarian Corporation. He has coined a slogan for the movement: "We will sell our shadow to those who stand within it." In 2005 he said that the Celebritarian Corporation has been "incubating for seven years" which if correct would indicate that Celebritarian Corporation, in some form, started in 1998.
The Celebritarian Corporation is also the namesake of an art gallery owned by Manson, called The Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art in Los Angeles for which his third exhibition was the inaugural show. From April 2-17, 2007, his recent works were on show at the Space 39 Modern & Contemporary in Florida. 40 pieces from this show traveled to Germany's Gallery Brigitte Schenk in Cologne to be publicly exhibited from June 28-July 28, 2007. Manson was refused admittance to Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), when he was in the city to attend the opening night. This was, according to Manson, due to his makeup. Other sources gave different reasons, however.
The price of Manson's works has been a somewhat controversial point for fans and critics alike, with most fans realistically unable to afford the paintings save for fine art editions and lithographs. However, some argue that Manson's prices are realistic and reasonable considering the long-term value at a time when prices for contemporary art have never been higher.
In April,2010, Manson held an exhibition titled Hell, etc. in Athens,Greece hosted by Art Modern Gallery.
Manson is widely known for his love of absinthe, frequently mentioning this during interviews or seen glass in hand. After collaborating with Oliver Matter and Markus Lion, Manson launched his own brand of Swiss-made absinthe, Mansinthe, in 2007. Manson's painting When I Get Old is used for the bottle label. Mansinthe is distilled in Switzerland from neutral grain alcohol and herbs and contains 10 milligrams of thujone. It is naturally green-colored and has 66.6% alcohol content.[12] Mansinthe was not well-received by its test panel, however. One Epicurious critic complained, "If a smell could speak, this absinthe is saying: 'Do not touch,'" comparing the scent to "sewage water, swamp mud and rubbing alcohol."[13] In spite of this, Mansinthe was awarded a gold medal at the 2008 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.[12] At launch, a limited number of bottles signed by Manson were sold for an additional price.
Ventures that failed to materialize include a novel based on the concepts of Holy Wood, a coffee table art book published by Flaunt under the name The Death of Art or Quintif, a fragrance and cosmetics line[14] and a feature film entitled Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll. Manson has also made two attempts at starting a record label; Posthuman Records was shut down in 2002 after two years of general inactivity, while Hell, etc. is currently operating from within Cooking Vinyl.
 In 2002, Manson worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to make the wish of a boy with a life-threatening disease come true. 16-year-old Andrew Baines from Tennessee had a wish to sing back-up vocals for a "big" band; Manson jumped on the task and took Baines under his wing to make his dream come true. Manson invited Baines to the studio on August 27, 2002, where he let Baines perform backing vocals for the then-upcoming album, The Golden Age of Grotesque. "Yesterday, I spent the afternoon with Andrew, who reminded me the things I create are only made complete by those who enjoy them. I just want to simply say, 'thank you' to Andrew for sharing such an important wish with me," Manson said, according MarilynManson.com.
 In 2005, Manson donated a signed collector's edition mask to Music for Relief to help victims of the 2004's Boxing Day Tsunami; this auction raised $155.
 In January 2006, Manson contributed a hand-painted guitar from the Six-String Masterpieces - The Dimebag Darrell Art Tribute to the Little Kids Rock auction. For every $100 raised by the product, Little Kids Rock would provide one low-income child with an instrument and lessons – Manson's guitar raised $6,250.
 In 2006, Manson became a benefactor of Project Nightlight, an LA area foundation that uses short films, music, and apparel to grab teenagers attention and inspire them to speak out against sexual and physical abuse. Manson afforded Project Nightlight a stand at the opening of his art gallery, and in April 2007  gave the charity a print of his painting The Eve of Destruction and a framed collector's edition mask.
 In 2007, December, Marilyn Manson played with a Gibson guitar on a Belgium concert at Forest National, signed the guitar and gave it to the charity "Music for Life", It's been put on Ebay, and raised ca. €3000. for the Health care in Africa
Marilyn Manson was first arrested in Florida on December 27, 1994 after a concert at Jacksonville's Club 5 for "violating the adult entertainment code." Manson was detained for 16 hours before been released without charge. Bizarrely police believed Manson had performed oral sex on stage with a man when in fact it was Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka wearing a fake penis (Manson claims this may have inspired the 'removed ribs' rumor) and thrown either his or the man's penis into the crowd. On February 5, 2001 in Marino, Italy, Manson suffered what is to date his only other post-concert arrest when he was accused of blasphemy having worn the outfit of a cardinal on stage during the song "Valentine's Day". Soon after the detention it was ascertained that Manson had not committed a crime and it appeared the legal troubles were over until the next day when Manson was arrested in Rome on charges of public indecency relating to a 1999 show where it was alleged Manson had exposed his penis. The day after the people in Bologna (Casalecchio di Reno (BO), Emilia-Romagna region) allowed him (Brian Warner = Marilyn Manson, the singer) to play even if he was arrested (but he did not play Sweet Dreams,even if he played Godeatgod live). Manson was released and the charges dropped, notably the arrests came a week after two teenagers brutally murdered an Italian nun which some less reputable sections of the Italian press blamed on Manson's music.
One of Manson's high-profile relationships, the defunct friendship with Trent Reznor, has been marked with mutual bitterness and perhaps vendetta. This started in the mid-90s, when Manson was due to make a track that would appear on the soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway, but instead Reznor was the one who wrote a song, "The Perfect Drug", for the film. In 1999, it seemed the two artists had patched their differences, as Manson made an appearance in the video for the Nine Inch Nails song "Starfuckers, Inc."
In 2004, Reznor was asked whether he had plans to do any covers; he sarcastically replied, "I was really hoping to do something unique and pertinent - like do an exact copy of "Personal Jesus" - but it was already taken." The following year, in a 2005 interview Manson said Reznor's Nothing Records had lost the master recordings of Manson's first three albums. He implied it was Reznor's intention, "Now that Nothing Records doesn't exist, I think there's only one of two people responsible for that. Out of those two people, there's only one that really has an opinion of me that is voiced very often."
In a civil battery suit, David Diaz, a security officer from a concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 27, 2000, sued for $75,000 in a Minneapolis federal court. After two days deliberation the jury decided that Manson's alleged molestation had been part of the show and that he had not overstepped his boundaries as an artist, ruling in favor of Manson and against Diaz. 
Manson was charged with "sexual misconduct" on August 16, 2001 after Joshua Keasler filed a complaint that as he was providing security for a July 30 concert Manson had allegedly spat on his head, wrapped his legs around him and began to gyrate his penis along his neck. Oakland County prosecutor David Gorcyca said that "It was offensive, crude and rude. This was not something that was orchestrated or choreographed as part of the act. The security guard was an unknowing and unwilling participant and, ironically, while he was there for protection... was sexually assaulted." The charge, punishable with up to two years imprisonment, was accompanied with a charge of disorderly conduct. The complaint came with an arrest warrant but Manson thwarted this by posting a $25,000 personal bond. In a one-day December 28, 2001 trial the presiding Judge dismissed the charge of "sexual misconduct" as Manson had in his view "gained no sexual gratification from the act." Manson pleaded "no contest" to the outstanding lesser charge, which carried only up to three months imprisonment, and was ordered to pay $4,000 in fines. After the trial Keasler pursued a civil lawsuit against Manson that was dropped when the two settled out of court in February 2002.
In May 2002 Twiggy Ramirez left the band, citing differences in perspective on the future of the band. He went on to play bass for A Perfect Circle and Nine Inch Nails. During this time, Manson claimed in interviews that he and Ramirez were still close friends, while Ramirez maintained that he rarely spoke to Manson. In an interview in February of 2006 Twiggy stated he was willing to record an album with Marilyn Manson if the right conditions were met. In Autumn 2006, Manson and Ramirez were photographed together at numerous parties in Los Angeles, in amicable poses.
In January 2008 it was announced that Ramirez had reunited with the band as live bassist for the last leg of the Rape of the World tour as well as co-writer of the band's seventh studio album. In an interview with The Heirophant on January 12, 2008, Manson revealed that the reconciliation with Ramirez was not as abrupt as it initially seemed, and that the two had been occasionally communicating with each other since speaking at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California prior to the Winter European leg of the Rape of the World tour.
John 5's reasons for leaving Marilyn Manson were cited as being mutual, despite the mysterious nature of his sudden firing by Manson's manager in 2004.
John was quoted at the time as saying about the incident, "I don't know. . . I was nothing but nice to him," he continued. "I never screwed up onstage — well not really badly — and I did everything I could to get along with him. Maybe, just maybe, it had something to do with the fact that I don't drink or do drugs, and he's not like that at all. Maybe he held that against me. I don't know. He never said." John 5 was notorious among fans as being drug and alcohol free.
Before the incident, Manson had assaulted John on stage, notably, Manson kicked John in the face during a televised performance, leading to a brief confrontation in front of a packed and roaring audience. This was during the intro to "The Beautiful People", when played at the Rock AM Ring 2003.
Also, during the tour John maintains that Manson spoke about matters other than business only once, "It was on my birthday, and he turned to me and said, "Happy birthday, faggot" — then walked away."
Despite this, John maintains he respects Manson, citing his skilled production style and his love for the band's music. John was already a fan of the band before joining in 1998. In response to a question regarding the reason for the split with Manson, John 5 was quoted by Vintage Guitar Magazine as saying, "(laughs) At the end of the last tour, I decided I really wanted to do this solo thing and that I had to devote all my time to it. The split with Manson was totally amicable. It wasn't one of those big breakups. We're friends. I wish there was some good dirt, but there's not (laughs)!"
In an interview prior to the January 19, 2008 performance in Orlando, Florida, Marilyn Manson revealed that John 5 would make a guest appearance during the show, stating: "I'll have [John] come on stage and play songs with us this first show. It would practically be the Holy Wood lineup." This guest appearance ultimately did not take place, however.
Before leaving the band nothing was heard of Madonna Wayne Gacy for over a year. In an exclusive conference conducted by Marilyn Manson in April 2007, he revealed the upcoming album Eat Me, Drink Me was recorded in collaboration between himself and Tim Skold. Essentially this meant Gacy did not partake in the album, but not ruling out the possibility of him performing as live keyboardist on the upcoming tour. Later, Manson revealed that Chris Vrenna (who previously drummed for the band during Ginger Fish's hiatus in 2004) would be performing as live keyboardist on the tour, in Gacy's place. 
On August 2, 2007, Gacy filed a lawsuit against Marilyn Manson seeking a back pay of $20 million dollars. Gacy claimed Manson has been using the band's money for personal interests, among which are a child's skeleton, masks made of human skin, stuffed animals such as a grizzly bear and two baboons, a collection of Nazi memorabilia, his drug addictions, his wedding with Dita Von Teese and the production of Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll.
On December 20, 2007, Manson counter sued Gacy. As a reaction to the lawsuit Gacy filed against Manson in August, Manson claimed, "keyboardist Stephen Bier did not carry out obligations to take part in master recordings [of The Golden Age Of Grotesque, Eat Me, Drink Me], concerts [of the Rape of the World tour] and the selling of band merchandise." In September 2008, it was reported that former band member Scott Putesky, who also had legal conflict with Manson in the past, had sided with Bier in the lawsuit. On December 11, 2009, following two years of litigation, it was reported that the lawsuit between Manson and Bier was settled. The result was that Marilyn Manson's insurance paid $175,000 legal fees and Bier received nothing following Grodsky & Oleck's sucessfull bid to have all of Bier's allegation's against them dismissed and legal fees amounting to $72,000, paid from settlement monies. [15]
After media comments from Manson that he wears his signature black leather pants 24/7, animal rights group PETA added Manson to PETA's 'Worst-Dressed Celebrities of 2008'.
Manson has criticized live guitarist Wes Borland's departure, confessing that "We almost made the mistake of having Wes play guitar but he re-joined Limp Bizkit. That move forever eradicated my feelings on his choices in life as an artist." When asked why he thinks Borland returned to Limp Bizkit, Manson said: "That is what I find myself asking when I urinate sometimes. He said he would never go back. If the reason is money, then I'd rather roll up a 5 note and shove it up my urethra. I'd rather set my dick on fire than join something that I hated."[16]
In his defense, Borland retorted that "I wrote nine songs to be submitted to the Manson record and none of them made it. I was really in hired gun land there, but was sort of being told that I wasn't. So when I figured that whole thing out, I knew I was never going to get an inch into that band [...] but it's the Marilyn Manson show over there — Limp Bizkit is more of a band."[17]
 In September 1996, former bassist Gidget Gein negotiated a settlement with Manson where he would receive $17,500 in cash, 20 percent of any royalties paid for recordings and for any songs he had a hand in writing and his share of any other royalties or fees the group earned while he was a member. Furthermore, the settlement allowed him to market himself as a former member of Marilyn Manson. This settlement was not honored, however.[18]
 In 1997, former guitarist and songwriter Scott Putesky (also known as Daisy Berkowitz), filed a $15 million suit against Manson seeking unpaid royalties for his contributions to the band's output up to that period, including the recently released Antichrist Superstar. The case was concluded in 1998, although the outcome was confidential.
 On January 4, 1999, SPIN editor Craig Marks filed an assault and battery lawsuit against Manson in the New York Supreme Court. The lawsuit specifically alleged that Manson, upset at not making the cover of SPIN, had yelled "I can kill you, I can kill your family, I can kill everyone you know!" before two of Manson's bodyguards were said to have charged him and held him against the wall and threw him to the floor after which it was alleged Manson had said, "That's what you get when you disrespect me." The case was dropped when, weeks later, Marks was fired from SPIN over financial irregularities.
 In a civil battery suit, David Diaz, a security officer from a concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 27, 2000, sued for $75,000 in a Minneapolis federal court. The federal court jury found in Manson's favor.
 In a civil suit presented by Oakland County, Michigan, Manson was charged with sexual misconduct against another security officer, Joshua Keasler, during a concert in Clarkston, Michigan on July 30, 2001. Oakland County originally filed assault and battery and criminal sexual misconduct charges, but the judge reduced the latter charge to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Manson pleaded no contest to the reduced charges, paid a $4,000 fine, and later settled the lawsuit under undisclosed terms.
 On April 3, 2002 Maria St. John filed in Los Angeles Superior Court accusing Manson of providing her adult daughter, Jennifer Syme, with cocaine and instructing her to drive while under the influence. The case was settled out of court.
 From 1997-2004 Manson owned the Mary Astor house in Los Angeles, which housed the infamous 'The White Room'-- Manson's home studio located in the pool house, where the entire album Mechanical Animals was recorded and was once owned by The Rolling Stones.
 All Manson's tattoos were done at Tattoos By Lou in Miami, Florida over a four-year span starting in 1991, until a new tattoo emerged in early-2007.
 In the 1990s, an Internet rumor spread stating Josh Saviano (who played Paul Pfeiffer in 1980s drama The Wonder Years) grew up to become Marilyn Manson. As of 2007, Josh Saviano is a licensed attorney in New York. He has, however, commented on the rumor, and thinks it is neat people believe him to be in a "goth band". In the TRL show Mothers Against Manson, Marilyn Manson admitted that out of all the rumors, the Wonder Years one is the one that pisses him off the most.[21]
 Contrary to popular lore, Manson has not had any ribs removed for the purpose of autofellatio. "If I really got my ribs removed," he said in the The Long Hard Road Out of Hell autobiography, "I would have been busy sucking my own dick on The Wonder Years instead of chasing Winnie Cooper."
 During his interview with David Letterman in 2003, Manson admitted ownership of at least one Foetus that he keeps in a jar, given to him as a gift.
 In an E! interview, Manson revealed that he owns a Nintendo DS. "My friend got me this little Japanese lawyer game; it's fucking amazing," he said in reference to Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also mentioned that he was "pretty good at Mario Kart".
 In an interview with MTV in 2002 Manson revealed that for most of his paintings he uses a children's Alice in Wonderland tin. He also uses a 1920's mortician paint kit originally used for retouching cadavers.
 Manson, who cites David Bowie as being his biggest influence, claims his favorite songs by him are "Quicksand", "Ashes to Ashes", and "We Are the Dead".
 Pets Manson has had in his life include the childhood dog, an Alaskan malamute named Aleusha, an orange tabby named O.J. which he found on the steps of Christian school, four Devon Rex cats named Aleister, Edgar, Herman, and Lily, and two dachshunds named Greta and Eva. After the divorce of Manson and ex-wife Dita Von Teese, Von Teese won the custody of both dachshunds and Aleister. For Manson's 39th birthday on January 5th, 2008, ex-girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood gave him a new cat, Charlie, as a birthday gift.
 Prior to his rise to fame, Manson posed nude for photos which were published in the March 1999 issue of Honcho.
 When asked in 2007 by Rolling Stone what his current favorite play list was, Manson chose among Radiohead's "Exit Music (For a Film)", Amy Winehouse's "Rehab" and David Bowie's classic "We Are the Dead".
 On the August 14, 2009 show at the AT&T Center in San Antonio, Texas, Manson revealed that he was conceived in the city of San Antonio.[1]
 On September 21, 2009, Marilyn Manson was diagnosed with the H1N1 virus (swine flu). On September 25, 2009, he claims to be healthy (physically).
 Often wears a contact lens with a different color in it oppose to his original eye (in an homage to David Bowies' two different sized pupils).
 He has a collection of medical prosthetics (artificial limbs, glass eyes, etc.) and vintage metal lunch boxes.
 His favorite film is Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, and expressed interest in playing Willy Wonka in the remake (the role went to Johnny Depp, who based his acting on Manson).
Manson guest starred on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim Show Tim and Eric's Awesome Show Great Job! as Darkman on March 29th, 2010.
In 2010, Dutch magazine Hitkrant featured Manson as the devil card, 15, a part of their celebrity tarot. [22]
 In 2010, Spin Magazine announced Manson's February 1999 Magazine cover to be one of the top 25 best Spin covers of all time.[23]
You know, something as simple as a movie like Paranormal Activity. I've watched that and I felt really condescended or insulted because I've had more scary, frightening and more interesting believable experiences happen that I can't explain and I think they're encouraged by my interest in things that maybe you shouldn't look into.
The burden of originality is one that most people don't want to accept. They'd rather sit in front of the TV and let that tell them what they're supposed to like, what they're supposed to buy, and what they're supposed to laugh at. You have Beavis and Butt-head telling you what music you're allowed to like and not like, and you've got sitcoms that have canned laughter that lets you know when to laugh if you're too stupid to know when the joke is--people are too lazy and too stupid to think for themselves because America has raised them like that.
Find out what's really out there. I never said to be like me, I say be like you and make a difference.
I view my job as being someone who is supposed to piss people off. I don't want to be just one-of-the-guys. I don't want to be just a smiling face you see on television presenting some vapid kind of easily-digestible garbage. This is rock and roll. I want to be a rock and roll star! Rock and roll is about shaking things up, making people act and react. That's what I do.
We've always found that with people being so desensitized, things have to be really shocking and have to punch you in the face to get your attention. Then, once you've got their attention. You can say something they might remember.
I picked that (Marilyn Manson) as the fakest stage name of all to say that this is what show business is, fake. Marilyn Monroe wasn't even her real name, Charles Manson isn't his real name, and now, I'm taking that to be my real name. But what's real? You can't find the truth, you just pick the lie you like the best. As long as you know everything's a lie, you can't hurt yourself.
Billy Zane is someone that I met and is a fellow artist, and sometimes we work together, painting, however pretentious that might sound. It was really quite simple, though. We would just spend time together, hanging out, listening to music, or painting. We became friends. He was one of the first people I met when I moved to Hollywood. And I think he's a cool actor.
I've always had the same level of excitement about making music, but now it seems so much more important because all of the blame that was put on me for Columbine. The entire incident, the way the media reacted, the people who were involved, the way I was treated, it hurt me personally because my career is my life. It made me feel a lot like how I felt growing up because it was a lot of people beating you down and treating you a certain way for something you're not even responsible for. I just really had to re-evaluate what I was gonna do; How am I gonna respond to this, how am I gonna take this? And I wanted to come out swinging with both fists.
It is a great feeling to write a song, but to be able to perform it, it takes on a whole different light.
I've always watched pop-culture shows, and I found out when I thought about this, Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson were the two most memorable people from the sixties, and I found it interesting that things like pop-culture shows put them on the same kind of celebrity status, and I thought that dichotomy of positive and negative, putting those two names together, represented what I had to say and what I was about. (On where the name, Marilyn Manson, came from.)
I hate the record industry because the whole idea of they make choices not based on art. They make choices based on money, and that's why they're destroyed. Because they don't know how to make money. You make money just by doing art. And you do it and it's pure and it succeeds. Because people want something that's real and if you over think it, it becomes something that's contrived.[24]
Michael Moore: "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine.... what would you say to them if they were here right now?"  Marilyn Manson: "I wouldn't say a single word to them I would listen to what they had to say, and that's what no one did."
