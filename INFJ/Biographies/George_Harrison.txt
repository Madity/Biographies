=======================================================
George Harrison,[nb 1] MBE (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer and songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Although John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the band's primary songwriters, most of their albums included at least one Harrison composition, including "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", which became the Beatles' second-most-covered song.
Harrison's earliest musical influences included Big Bill Broonzy, George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Chet Atkins, Chuck Berry and Ry Cooder were significant later influences. By 1965 he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". He developed an interest in the Hare Krishna movement and became an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing them to the other members of the Beatles and their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass, from which two hit singles originated. He also organized the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Ravi Shankar, a precursor for later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. Harrison was a music and film producer as well as a musician; he founded Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founded HandMade Films in 1978.
Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer, and in 1988 co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Tom Petty, among others. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".
Harrison's first marriage, to Pattie Boyd, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Trinidad Arias, with whom he had one son, Dhani. Harrison died in 2001, aged 58, from lung cancer. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India, in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition. He left almost £100 million in his will.
Born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, on 25 February 1943, Harrison was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his wife Louise (née French).[3] He had one sister, Louise, and two brothers, Harry and Peter.[4] His mother was a shop assistant from a Catholic family with Irish roots, and his father was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the White Star Line.[5] His future wife, the model Pattie Boyd, described Harrison's parents as "quite short and very Liverpudlian".[6] According to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: "All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music."[6] An enthusiastic music fan, she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows.[7] While pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India. Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb."[8]
Harrison was born and lived the first six years of his life at 12 Arnold Grove, Wavertree, Liverpool, in a terraced house in a cul-de-sac.[9] The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949 the family were offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke.[10] In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School.[11] He passed his 11-plus examination and attended the prestigious Liverpool Institute from 1954 to 1959.[12]
Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt, Hoagy Carmichael, and Big Bill Broonzy. In early 1956 he had an epiphany: while riding his bicycle, he heard Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel" playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll.[13] He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks, and later commented, "I was totally into guitars".[14]
Although apprehensive about his son's interest in pursuing a music career, in late 1956 Harrison's father bought him a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar.[15] A friend of his father's taught Harrison how to play "Whispering", "Sweet Sue", and "Dinah", and inspired by the music of Lonnie Donegan, Harrison formed a skiffle group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly.[16] On the bus to school Harrison met Paul McCartney, who became a member of John Lennon's band the Quarrymen, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.[17]
In March 1958 Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm's Morgue Skiffle Club, playing "Guitar Boogie Shuffle", but Lennon felt that Harrison, then 14, was too young to join the band.[18] During a second meeting, arranged by McCartney, he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental "Raunchy" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus.[19] Soon afterwards he began socializing with the group, filling in on guitar as needed,[20] and by the time he turned 15 they had accepted him as a member.[21] Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers, a local department store.[22] During their first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym "Carl Harrison," paying tribute to Carl Perkins.[23]
In 1960 Allan Williams arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the Kaiserkeller club in Hamburg, owned by Bruno Koschmider.[24] The impromptu musical education Harrison received while playing long hours with the Beatles, as well as the guitar lessons he took from Tony Sheridan while they briefly served as his backing group, laid the foundations of his sound and of his quiet, professional role within the group; he was later known as "the quiet Beatle".[25] The band's first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs.[26] When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961, he polished their image and secured them a recording contract with EMI.[27] The group's first single, "Love Me Do", peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart, and by the time their debut album, Please Please Me, was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived.[28] Their second album, With the Beatles (1963), included "Don't Bother Me", Harrison's first solo writing credit.[29]
By 1965's Rubber Soul, Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)".[30][nb 2] He later called Rubber Soul his "favourite [Beatles] album".[32] Revolver (1966) included three of his compositions: "Taxman", "Love You To" and "I Want to Tell You".[33] His introduction of the drone-like tambura part on Lennon's "Tomorrow Never Knows" exemplified the band's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments.[34] The tabla-driven "Love You To" was the Beatles' first genuine foray into Indian music.[35] According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck, the song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody.[36] Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on "Strawberry Fields Forever".[37]
By late 1966 Harrison's interests had moved away from the Beatles, as reflected in his choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967.[38][nb 3] His sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired "Within You Without You", to which no other Beatle contributed.[40] He played sitar and tambura on the track, backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba, swarmandal and tabla.[41][nb 4] In 1968 his song "The Inner Light" was recorded at the EMI Studios in Bombay, featuring a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments.[43] Released as the B-side to McCartney's "Lady Madonna", it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single.[43] Derived from a quotation from the Tao Te Ching, the song's lyric reflected Harrison's deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation, while musically it embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music, rather than the Hindustani style of his previous work in the genre.[44]
Dylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles.[45] He established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, in contrast with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and his growing desire to assert his independence from the band.[46] During the recording of The Beatles in 1968, tensions ran high, and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly.[47] Harrison's songwriting contributions to the album included "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar, "Piggies", "Long, Long, Long", and "Savoy Truffle".[48] Tensions among the Beatles surfaced again during the filming of rehearsals at Twickenham Studios in January 1969 for what became the album Let It Be.[46] Frustrated by the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio, as well as by what he perceived as Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles and a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January, but agreed to return twelve days later.[49]
Relations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, during sessions for their final recorded album, Abbey Road.[50] The LP included two of Harrison's most respected Beatles compositions: "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", which became one half of the Beatles' first double-sided number one single, Harrison's first A-side, and his first chart topper.[51] In 1969 Frank Sinatra recorded "Something", and later dubbed it "the greatest love song of the past fifty years".[52] Lennon considered it the best song on Abbey Road, and it became the Beatles' second most covered song after "Yesterday".[53] Author Peter Lavezzoli wrote: "Harrison would finally achieve equal songwriting status … with his two classic contributions to the final Beatles' LP".[54]
In April 1970 when Harrison's "For You Blue" was released in America as a double A-side with McCartney's "The Long and Winding Road", it became the band's second chart-topping double A-side and "For You Blue" became Harrison's second number one hit.[55] His increased productivity and the Beatles' reluctance to include his songs on their albums meant that by the time of their break-up he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions.[56] While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's break-up.[57] Harrison's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded the Harrison song "I Me Mine".[58]
Before the Beatles' break-up Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound, both of which include mainly instrumental compositions. Wonderwall Music, a soundtrack to the 1968 film Wonderwall, blends Indian and Western instrumentation, while Electronic Sound is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer.[59] Released in November 1968, Wonderwall Music was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records.[60] Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album, which contains the experimental sound collage "Dream Scene", recorded several months before Lennon's "Revolution 9".[61]
In December 1969 Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends.[62] During the tour that included Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Harrison began to write "My Sweet Lord", which became his first single as a solo artist.[63] Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrison to learn slide guitar, significantly influencing his later music.[64]
After years of being restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles' albums, Harrison released All Things Must Pass. It was a triple album,[65] with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends.[56][66] Regarded by many as his best work, the album topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.[67][68][nb 5] The LP produced the number-one hit single "My Sweet Lord" and the top-ten single "What Is Life".[70] The album was co-produced by Phil Spector using his "Wall of Sound" approach,[71] and the musicians included Starr, Clapton, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, the whole of Delaney and Bonnie's Friends band and the Apple group Badfinger.[56][72][nb 6] Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described All Things Must Pass as being "of classic Spectorian proportions, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons."[74] Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considered the lyrics of the album's title track "a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion" to Harrison's former band.[75] In 1971 Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over "My Sweet Lord" owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit "He's So Fine".[76] He denied deliberately plagiarizing the song, but lost the court case in 1976 as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously.[77]
In 2000 Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion."[78] He commented on the production: "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it ... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now."[79]
Responding to a request from Ravi Shankar, Harrison organized a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971, drawing over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's Madison Square Garden.[80] The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War.[81] Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, Leon Russell, Badfinger, Preston and Starr.[81]
A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was released by Apple Corps that year, followed by a concert film in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended."[82] The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.[83][nb 7]
Living in the Material World (1973) held the number one spot on the Billboard album chart for five weeks, and the album's single, "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)", also reached number one in the US.[85] In the UK, the LP achieved number two, spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8.[70] The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs.[86] In Greene's opinion it "contained many of the strongest compositions of his career".[87] Rolling Stone's Stephen Holden declared the album "vastly appealing" and "profoundly seductive ... [it] stands alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance."[88] Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental, a reaction that left Harrison despondent.[89]
In November 1974 Harrison began his 45-date Dark Horse Tour, becoming the first ex-Beatle to tour North America.[90] In addition to performances by Harrison with an ensemble of musicians such as Preston, Tom Scott, Willie Weeks, Andy Newmark and Jim Horn, the tour also included traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by "Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends".[91] Despite numerous positive reviews the consensus reaction to the tour was negative, with complaints about the content, structure, and length; the show's duration of two and a half hours was seen as excessive at the time.[92] Some fans found Shankar's significant presence a bizarre disappointment, having expected to see only Harrison perform, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison's "sermonizing".[93] Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and some of the substitutions were seen as "gratuitously offensive".[93] His laryngitis-affected vocals also disappointed fans and critics, who began calling the tour "dark hoarse".[94] Harrison was so deeply bothered by the caustic backlash that he did not tour again until the 1990s.[93] The author Robert Rodriguez commented: "While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated."[95] Leng called the tour "groundbreaking" and "revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music".[96]
In December Harrison released Dark Horse, an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career.[97] Rolling Stone called it "the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks."[98] The album reached number 4 on the Billboard chart and the single "Dark Horse" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK.[99][nb 8] The music critic Mikal Gilmore described Dark Horse as "one of Harrison's most fascinating works – a record about change and loss".[100]
Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was the soul music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975).[101] He considered it the least satisfactory of the three he had recorded since All Things Must Pass.[102] Leng identified "bitterness and dismay" in many of the album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: "He wasn't up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture ... I didn't like his frame of mind".[103] He released two singles from the LP: "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.[104]
Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles "This Song" and "Crackerbox Palace", both of which reached the top 25 in the US.[105][nb 9] The surreal humour of "Crackerbox Palace" reflected Harrison's association with Monty Python's Eric Idle, who directed a comical music video for the song.[108] With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, Thirty Three & 1/3 earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since All Things Must Pass.[108][nb 10]
In 1979, following his second marriage and the birth of his son Dhani, he released George Harrison. The album and the single "Blow Away" both made the Billboard top 20.[110] The album marked the beginning of Harrison's gradual retreat from the music business, and the fruition of ideas introduced on All Things Must Pass. In 1978 the death of his father in May and the birth of his son in August had influenced his decision to devote more time to his family than to his career.[111] Leng described the album as "melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss."[111]

The murder of Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concerns about stalkers.[112] It was also a deep personal loss, although unlike McCartney and Starr, Harrison had had little contact with Lennon in the years before his death.[113][nb 11] Following the murder, Harrison commented: "After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon. I am shocked and stunned."[112]
Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make it a tribute song to Lennon.[114] "All Those Years Ago", which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney, as well as Starr's original drum part, peaked at number two in the US charts.[115][116] The single was included on the album Somewhere in England in 1981.[117] Harrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982's Gone Troppo received little notice from critics or the public.[118]
During this period he made several guest appearances, including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session.[119][nb 12] In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert, an event organized to raise money for the Birmingham Children's Hospital.[121] The following year, he appeared at The Prince's Trust concert at London's Wembley Arena, performing "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" and "Here Comes the Sun".[122] In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal.[123] Harrison recalled: "Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more ... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me."[124]
In November 1987 Harrison released the platinum album Cloud Nine.[125][126] Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK.[127][128] The accompanying music video received substantial airplay,[129] and another single, "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988.[130] Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: "George made you feel at home, in his home ... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it at the end of the hall for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding ... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding."[131] Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart – "Devil's Radio", "This Is Love" and "Cloud 9".[127]
In 1988 Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. The band had gathered in Dylan's garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release.[132] Harrison's record company decided the track, "Handle with Care", was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full album. The LP, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1, was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.[133] Harrison's pseudonym on the first album was "Nelson Wilbury"; he used the name "Spike Wilbury" for their second album.[134]
After Orbison's death in December 1988 the group recorded as a four-piece.[135] Their second release, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3. According to Lynne, "That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'"[136] It reached number 14 in the UK, where it went platinum with certified sales of more than 3,000,000 units.[137] The Wilburys never performed live and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album.[138]
In 1989 Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Tom Petty's song "I Won't Back Down".[139] Starr is filmed playing the drums, but did not play on the track; Harrison played acoustic guitar and provided backing vocals.[140][nb 13] In December 1991, Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan.[143] It was Harrison's first since 1974 and no others followed.[144][nb 14] On 6 April 1992, Harrison held a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party at the Royal Albert Hall, his first London performance since the Beatles' 1969 rooftop concert.[146] In October 1992 he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City, playing alongside Dylan, Clapton, McGuinn, Petty and Neil Young.[147]
In 1994 Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney, Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the Beatles Anthology project. This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career.[148] Released in December 1995, "Free as a Bird" was the first new Beatles single since 1970.[149] In March 1996, they released a second single, "Real Love". Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song.[150] He later commented on the project: "I hope somebody does this to all my crap demos when I'm dead, make them into hit songs."[151]
Following the Anthology project, Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latter's Chants of India. Harrison's final television appearance was a VH-1 special to promote the album, taped in May 1997.[152] In January 1998, Harrison attended Carl Perkins's funeral in Jackson, Tennessee, performing a brief rendition of Perkins's song "Your True Love".[153] In June 1998, he attended the public memorial service for Linda McCartney, and appeared on Starr's album Vertical Man, playing guitar on two tracks.[154]
On 30 December 1999, 36-year-old Michael Abram broke into the Harrisons' Friar Park home and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a poker and a lamp.[155][156] Following the attack, Harrison was hospitalized with more than forty stab wounds. He released a statement soon after regarding his assailant: "[he] wasn't a burglar, and he certainly wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys."[157][nb 15]
In 1997, Harrison was diagnosed with throat cancer and treated with radiotherapy, which was thought at the time to be successful.[155] In May 2001 it was revealed that he had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs,[161] and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland.[162] While in Switzerland, Starr visited him, but had to cut his stay short to travel to Los Angeles, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: "Do you want me to come with you?"[163] In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City for lung cancer that had spread to his brain.[164] When the news was publicized, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.[nb 16] On 12 November, the three living former Beatles met for the last time at Harrison's hotel in New York for lunch.[170]
Harrison died on 29 November 2001, aged 58, from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.[171] He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers near Varanasi, India, by his close family in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition.[172] He left almost £100 million in his will.[173]
Harrison's final album, the posthumously released Brainwashed (2002), was completed by his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne.[174] Included in the album's liner notes is a quotation from the Bhagavad Gita: "There never was a time when you or I did not exist. Nor will there be any future when we shall cease to be."[175] A media-only single, "Stuck Inside a Cloud", which Leng described as "a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality", achieved number 27 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart.[176][177] The single "Any Road", released in May 2003, reached number 37 on the UK Singles Chart.[128] "Marwa Blues" went on to receive the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, while "Any Road" was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.[178]
Harrison wrote his first song, "Don't Bother Me", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as "an exercise to see if I could write a song", as he remembered.[179] "Don't Bother Me" appeared on the band's second album, With the Beatles, later that year, then on Meet the Beatles! in the US in early 1964.[180] In 1965, he contributed "I Need You" and "You Like Me Too Much" to the album Help!.[181][182]
Harrison's songwriting ability improved through the years, but his material did not earn full respect from his fellow Beatles until near the group's break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: "Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours".[183] Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs.[184][57] Most Beatles albums contain at least two Harrison compositions, and there are three of his songs on the 1966 Revolver LP, "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter", wrote Inglis.[185]
Of the 1967 Harrison song "Within You Without You", author Gerry Farrell claimed that Harrison had created a "new form", calling the composition: "a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music."[186] Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together."[187] Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described "Something" as a masterpiece: "an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced."[188] According to Kenneth Womack, 'Harrison comes into his own on Abbey Road ... "Here Comes the Sun" is matched—indeed, surpassed—only by "Something", his crowning achievement'.[189] Inglis considered Abbey Road a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's contributions to the LP as "exquisite", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs. During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, proactively rejecting suggestions for changes to his music or lyrics, particularly from McCartney.[190]
His interest in Indian music proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to Rolling Stone, "Harrison's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on ... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgard Varèse and Igor Stravinsky".[191] In 1997, author Gerry Farrell commented: "It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement ... that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion."[192]
"He was clearly an innovator: George, to me, was taking certain elements of R&B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique."[193]
Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as "a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song".[194] Harrison's friend and former bandmate Tom Petty agreed: "He just had a way of getting right to the business, of finding the right thing to play."[195] The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles' recordings.[196] He identified Chuck Berry as an early influence and Ry Cooder as an important later influence.[197]
In 1961 the Beatles recorded "Cry for a Shadow", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows.[198] The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time, he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction.[199] Harrison's liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins.[200] Within this framework he often utilized syncopation, as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's "Roll Over Beethoven" and "Too Much Monkey Business".[201] Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on "I'll Be on My Way".[202] He was the first person to own a Rickenbacker 360/12, a guitar that featured twelve strings in 6 pairs, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart; the higher 4 being pairs tuned in unison. The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string. This, and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve string guitar providing the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles recordings.[202] His use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Day's Night helped to popularize the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles' "secret weapon".[203][nb 17]
Harrison wrote the chord progression of his first published song, "Don't Bother Me" (1963), almost exclusively in the Dorian mode, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music. The dark timbre of his guitar playing on the track was accentuated by his use of uncomplicated yet effective C+9 chord voicings and a solo in the minor pentatonic scale.[205] By 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on "A Hard Day's Night".[200] In 1965 he used an expression pedal to control his guitar's volume on "I Need You", creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements.[206] He used the same volume-swell technique on "Yes It Is", applying what Everett described as "ghostly articulation" to the song's natural harmonics.[200]
Of Rubber Soul's "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: "it's like a million other songs written around the D chord. If you move your fingers about, you get various little melodies ... it amazes me that people still find new permutations of the same notes."[207] His other contribution to the album, "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as "ambiguous tonal coloring", utilizing chromaticism in G major with a "strange" mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a "tour de force of altered scale degrees".[208] In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition "I'm Only Sleeping" and a guitar counter-melody on "And Your Bird Can Sing" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats.[209] His guitar playing on "I Want to Tell You" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Pepper's "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.[210]
Everett described Harrison's guitar solo from "Old Brown Shoe" as "stinging [and] highly Claptonesque".[211] He identified two of the composition's significant motifs: a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E.[212] Huntley called the song "a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo."[213] In Greene's opinion, Harrison's demo for the song contains "one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song."[214]
Harrison's playing on Abbey Road, and in particular on "Something", marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas.[215] According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: "'Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison's guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime".[189] Harrison received an Ivor Novello award in July 1970 for "Something", as "The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year".[216]
After Delaney Bramlett inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the dilruba.[217] Leng described Harrison's slide guitar solo on Lennon's "How Do You Sleep?" as a departure for "the sweet soloist of 'Something'", calling his playing "rightly famed ... one of Harrison's greatest guitar statements."[218] Lennon commented: "That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life."[218]
A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrison's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on Gone Troppo (1982) to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" on ukulele in 1992.[219] Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental "Marwa Blues" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena, calling it "yet another demonstration of Harrison's unique slide approach".[220] Harrison was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of "Free as a Bird".[221] He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society.[222] Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks, including the Beatles' songs "Drive My Car", "She Said She Said", "Golden Slumbers", "Birthday" and "Honey Pie".[223] He also played bass on several solo recordings, including "Faster", "Wake Up My Love" and "Bye Bye Love".[224]
When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model.[225] His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso.[226] The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine (1987).[227] He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on "She Loves You", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.[228][229] In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured.[230] Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and used it in recording Rubber Soul, notably on the song "Nowhere Man".[231]
In early 1966 Harrison, Lennon, and McCartney each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on Revolver.[232] Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album.[233] He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word "Bebopalula" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, "Rocky", on the headstock.[234] He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career.[235] In mid-1968 he acquired a Gibson Les Paul that he nicknamed "Lucy".[236] Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200, which he used for early demos of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".[237] In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by a Fender master builder who also crafted a prototype Stratocaster for Jimi Hendrix.[238]
Harrison's music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists Doris Troy, Jackie Lomax and Billy Preston.[239] Throughout his solo career, he benefited from the inclusion of guest musicians on his albums, and he made efforts to reciprocate the favours by participating in their recordings. He was featured as a guitarist on tracks by Dave Mason, Nicky Hopkins, Alvin Lee, Ronnie Wood, Billy Preston and Tom Scott.[240] Harrison co-wrote songs and music with Dylan, Clapton, Preston, Doris Troy, David Bromberg, Gary Wright, Wood, Jeff Lynne, and Tom Petty, among others.[241]
Harrison co-wrote the song "Badge" with Clapton, which was included on Cream's 1969 album, Goodbye.[242] Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track, using the pseudonym "L'Angelo Misterioso" for contractual reasons.[243] He used the same pseudonym when he recorded a guitar part for "Never Tell Your Mother She's Out of Tune", a song from Jack Bruce's 1969 solo album, Songs for a Tailor.[244] In May 1970 he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylan's album New Morning.[245] In addition to his own work, between 1971 and 1973 he co-wrote and/or produced three top ten hits for Starr: "It Don't Come Easy", "Back Off Boogaloo" and "Photograph".[246] In 1971 he played electric slide guitar on "How Do You Sleep?" and a dobro on "Crippled Inside", both from Lennon's Imagine album.[247] Also that year, he produced and played slide guitar on Badfinger's top ten hit "Day After Day", and a dobro on Preston's "I Wrote a Simple Song".[248][nb 18] He worked with Harry Nilsson on "You're Breakin' My Heart" (1972) and with Cheech & Chong on "Basketball Jones" (1973).[250] In 1973 he produced and made a guest appearance on the album Shankar Family & Friends.[251]
In 1974 Harrison founded Dark Horse Records. In addition to eventually releasing his own albums on the label, he initially used the company as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians.[252] He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles.[253] Harrison explained: "Most of the stuff will be what I produce".[254] Eric Idle commented: "He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of."[255] The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter, whose album Harrison produced, which provided Dark Horse with their first hit, "Costafine Town".[256] Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva, and Stairsteps.[257]
Harrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scott's album New York Connection (1976), and in 1981 he played guitar on "Walk a Thin Line", from Mick Fleetwood's The Visitor.[258] In 1996 he recorded "Distance Makes No Difference With Love" with Carl Perkins, and played slide guitar on the title track of Dylan's Under the Red Sky album.[259] In 2001 he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra's comeback album Zoom, and on the song "Love Letters" for Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings.[260] He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani, "Horse to the Water", which was recorded on 1 October, eight weeks before his death. It appeared on Jools Holland's album Small World, Big Band.[261]
During the Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar.[262][263] Harrison described Shankar as "the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didn't try to impress me."[264] Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music.[265] According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of the instrument on the Beatles' song "Norwegian Wood" "opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966–67."[266] Lavezzoli described Harrison as "the man most responsible for this phenomenon".[267][nb 19]
In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted.[269] On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi.[269] Lavezzoli described Harrison's sitar playing on the Revolver track "Love You To" as an "astonishing improvement" over "Norwegian Wood" and "the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician."[270] In September, he returned to India to study sitar with Shankar.[269] He initially stayed in Bombay, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake where Shankar taught him for six weeks.[269] After Shankar, he received tutelage from Shambhu Das.[271]
Harrison studied the instrument until 1968, when an encounter with Clapton and Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to put down the instrument and return to guitar playing. He commented: "I decided ... I should get back to the guitar because I'm not getting any better at it, and I'm not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier."[272]

By the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles.[273] During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga.[274] Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to Bombay with his wife Pattie, where he studied sitar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places.[275] In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[275] Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time—these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music."[109]
Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s, and a devotee of the Indian mystic Paramahansa Yogananda.[276] In mid-1969, he produced the single "Hare Krishna Mantra", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Soon after, Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly japa-yoga chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.[277][nb 20] He respected people of other faiths and once remarked: "All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call."[279] He commented on his beliefs:
Krishna actually was in a body as a person ... What makes it complicated is, if he's God, what's he doing fighting on a battlefield? It took me ages to try to figure that out, and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita that made me realise what it was. Our idea of Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield in the chariot. So this is the point—that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body ... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says, 'Please Krishna, you drive the chariot' because unless we bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of our spiritual guides ... we're going to crash our chariot, and we're going to turn over, and we're going to get killed in the battlefield. That's why we say 'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna', asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.[280]
Before his religious conversion, the only British performer known for similar activities had been Cliff Richard, whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public. "By contrast," wrote Inglis, "Harrison's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity ... what he, and the Beatles had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs."[281]
Harrison married the model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney as best man.[282] Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Day's Night, in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl.[283] They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalized in 1977.[284] Boyd said her decision to end their marriage and leave Harrison was due largely to his repeated infidelities, culminating in an affair with Starr's wife Maureen, which Boyd called "the final straw".[285] She characterized the last year of their marriage as "fuelled by alcohol and cocaine", and she stated: "George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart."[286] She subsequently moved in with Clapton, and they married in 1979.[287][nb 21]
Harrison married Dark Horse Records' secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias on 2 September 1978. They had met at the Dark Horse offices in Los Angeles in 1974, and together had one son, Dhani Harrison, born on 1 August 1978.[289]
He restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos were filmed including "Crackerbox Palace"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass.[290][nb 22] He employed ten workers to maintain the 36-acre (150,000 m2) garden.[293] Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism: "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'"[294] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated "to gardeners everywhere".[295] The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics.[296] Taylor commented: "George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life."[297]
Harrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car.[298] He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; at 12 he had attended his first race, the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree.[298][299] He wrote "Faster" as a tribute to the Formula One racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Ronnie Peterson. Proceeds from its release went to the Gunnar Nilsson cancer charity, set up after the Swedish driver's death from the disease in 1978.[300] Harrison's first extravagant car, a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London. An anonymous Beatles collector paid £350,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965.[301]
For most of the Beatles' career the relationships in the group were close. According to Hunter Davies, "the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends." Harrison's ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles "all belonged to each other" and admitted, "George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it."[302]
Starr said, "We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other". He added, "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational."[303]
Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was "one of young follower and older guy ... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started."[304] The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives.[305] In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: "John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a bastard – but that's the great thing about him, you see?"[306]
Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together.[307] McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring.[308] McCartney was best man at Harrison's wedding in 1966, and was the only Beatle in attendance.[309] McCartney has referred to Harrison as his "baby brother".[310] In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman, Harrison stated: "[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player".[311] Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves.[312] Rodriguez commented: "even to the end of George's days, theirs was a volatile relationship".[313]
Harrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War. After the band's break-up, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War.[314] Harrison recorded the song "Bangla Desh", and pushed Apple Records to release his song alongside Shankar's "Joy Bangla" in an effort to raise funds.[315] Shankar then asked for Harrison's advice about planning a small charity event in the US. Harrison responded by organizing the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000.[316] In June 1972, UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar with the "Child Is the Father of Man" award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh.[317]
The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF, a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF, aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies.[318] In December 2007, they donated $450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh.[318] On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.[319]
In 1973 Peter Sellers introduced Harrison to Denis O'Brien. Soon after, the two went into business together.[320] In 1978, in an effort to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films.[321] Harrison explained: "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset ... [near] an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper' ... So we said ... we'll call it Handmade Films."[320]
Their opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of their Chief Executive, Bernard Delfont.[322] Harrison financed the production of Life of Brian in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called "the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history."[255] The film grossed $21 million at the box office in the US.[320] The first film distributed by HandMade Films was The Long Good Friday (1980), and the first they produced was Time Bandits (1981), a co-scripted project by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin.[323] The film featured a new song by Harrison, "Dream Away", in the closing credits.[324] Time Bandits became one of HandMade's most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.[324]
Harrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade, including Mona Lisa, Shanghai Surprise and Withnail and I. He made several cameo appearances in these films, including a role as a nightclub singer in Shanghai Surprise, for which he recorded five new songs.[325] According to author and musicologist Ian Inglis, Harrison's "executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country's most memorable movies of the 1980s."[326] A series of box office bombs in the late 1980s caused HandMade to cease operations in 1991; three years later, the company was sold.[327]
In 1965 Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October.[328] In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be.[329] The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him.[330] In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work.[331] Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".[195]
In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Clapton organized the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr.[332] Eric Idle, who described Harrison as "one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced", performed Monty Python's "Lumberjack Song".[333] The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.[332]
In 2004 Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh.[334] On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.[335]
The documentary film, George Harrison: Living in the Material World, was directed by Martin Scorsese and released in October 2011. The film features interviews with Olivia and Dhani Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Terry Gilliam, Starr, Clapton, McCartney, Jim Keltner and Astrid Kirchherr.[336]

=======================================================
George Harrison was known as the quiet Beatle, and he was also the quietest ex-Beatle. His was not the way of the rock star, as he neither courted nor relished fame. Yet his seeming diffidence was deceptive, as he left behind an impressive legacy as a solo artist. Harrison’s 11 studio albums (not counting best-of’s) include the masterful All Things Must Pass (1970) and a memorable late-career milestone, Cloud Nine (1987). He was the first Beatle to tour the U.S. as a solo artist and also launched his own label (Dark Horse Records). Most important, Harrison wrote and sang about spirituality and transcendence. He immersed himself in Indian music at Beatlemania’s height and became a lifelong devotee of Hindu religion, Krishna consciousness and Vedic philosophy.
In hindsight, Harrison’s albums lay bare his conflicted sensibilities: real-world engagement vs. spiritual retreat and popular artist vs. private recluse. He titled one of his best-selling albums Living in the Material World, and that summed up his quandary. Harrison forthrightly addressed weighty matters on record and made his ruminations appealing as popular music, too. Incorporating spirituality into popular music was not an easy thing to do, and it won him the respect of fans and colleagues. Derek Taylor, the Beatles’ publicist and a longtime friend, called him “the boldest man I ever met.”
Born in Liverpool in 1943, Harrison joined the Quarry Men, which included John Lennon and Paul McCartney, as lead guitarist at age 15. When they changed their name to the Beatles in 1960, he was only 17. Harrison’s influences ran to rockabilly heroes like Carl Perkins and British skiffle legend Lonnie Donegan. His retooled rockabilly licks were key to the Beatles’ early sound, while his sharp, innovative lead guitar was essential to later recordings. During the Beatles’ tenure he introduced Western ears to Indian music. Harrison first played the sitar on “Norwegian Wood” (1965) and then unleashed a full-blown sitar showcase, “Within You Without You,” on Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). When Delaney Bramlett (of Delaney & Bonnie) introduced Harrison to slide guitar in 1968, he became a leading exponent of that style.
Harrison wrote some of the Beatles’ best-loved songs, including “If I Needed Someone,” “Taxman,” “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” “Something,” “Here Comes the Sun” and “I Me Mine.” He also figured prominently in the group’s decision to abandon live performances, where they were routinely drowned out by screams, and instead devote their time to the recording studio. Of life with the Beatles, he pithily remarked, “We met everyone in the world and never had a moment’s peace.” Harrison stormed out of sessions for Let It Be in 1969. Although he would return, he regarded the glare of fame as a Beatle with wary disdain. “They used us as an excuse to go mad, the world did,” he said in The Beatles Anthology, “and then blamed it on us.” In 1969, Harrison purchased a sprawling rural estate known as Friar Park, and it became his refuge from the world.
Soon after the Beatles’ breakup in 1970, Harrison released All Things Must Pass. It was his first true solo album (not counting Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound, experimental releases from the Beatles era). Harrison’s songwriting talent, largely kept under wraps in the Beatles, poured forth on the three-disc set, which contained two albums of songs and one of jams. Harrison’s spiritually slanted tunes were given the full “Wall of Sound” treatment by producer Phil Spector. Standout tracks include “Isn’t It a Pity,” “Beware of Darkness,” “What Is Life” and “My Sweet Lord.” Rolling Stone hailed the album as “Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountaintops and vast horizons.” Both All Things Must Pass and “My Sweet Lord” went to Number One. (Noting the resemblance of “My Sweet Lord” to “He’s So Fine,” by the Chiffons, the latter’s publisher sued Harrison, who was ultimately found guilty of “unconscious plagiarism.”) Re-released in 2002 on CD with bonus tracks and a new version of “My Sweet Lord,” All Things Must Pass remains among the most esteemed of all Beatles solo works.
Harrison’s next masterstroke was The Concert for Bangladesh, rock’s first large-scale benefit concert, organized to raise awareness and money for war-torn Bangladesh. Held on August 1, 1971, at Madison Square Garden, the star-studded affair included Bob Dylan, Leon Russell, Eric Clapton, and Harrison’s Indian-music mentor, Ravi Shankar. Proceeds from the concert, soundtrack album and documentary film were earmarked for the United Nations Children’s Fund for Relief to Refugee Children of Bangladesh. It became a model for rock-benefit projects from Live Aid to The Concert for New York City. Over time, Harrison’s donations to UNICEF for Bangladesh from concert, film and album proceeds totaled more than $13 million.
Living in the Material World (1973), a single album, topped the album chart for five weeks and contained the Number One single ”Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth),” as well as Harrison’s biting commentary on the Beatles’ ongoing legal travails, “Sue Me, Sue You Blues.” The next year Harrison launched Dark Horse, a record label (distributed by A&M) that would release albums by himself and others, including Ravi Shankar and Splinter. His ambitions were modest: “I want it to be reasonably small,” he said. By calling his new album and label Dark Horse, Harrison was implicitly stating that the Beatles’ dark horse – “The one that nobody’s bothered to put any money on,” said Harrison – was coming in a winner. Dark Horse charted highly, reaching Number Four, yet received lukewarm reviews. The North American tour that followed (the first stateside concerts by an ex-Beatle) proved problematic because Harrison had strained his voice in rehearsals. Another unremarkable album, Extra Texture (Read All About It), appeared in 1975.
Harrison rebounded with Thirty-three & 1/3 (1976), highlighted by “This Song” (Number 25), a wry retort to the “My Sweet Lord” lawsuit, and “Crackerbox Palace” (Number 19), a paean to his beloved Friar Park. During the three-year hiatus from recording that followed, Harrison divorced his first wife, Patti (who subsequently wed his close friend Eric Clapton), and married Olivia Trinidad Arias, with whom he’d spend the rest of his life. He also launched HandMade Films, a production company that debuted with Monty Python’s Life of Brian. Over the next 11 years, HandMade released 27 movies, including Time Bandits (1981) and Mona Lisa (1986). Harrison greatly savored the television film All You Need Is Cash, a mock-documentary Beatles parody featuring the Rutles.
Harrison’s next solo album, George Harrison (1979), contained several of his loveliest songs, including “Blow Away” (Number 16) and “Here Comes the Moon.” Next came Somewhere in England (1981), notable for “All Those Years Ago” (Number Two), written after John Lennon’s murder. With backing vocals from Paul and Linda McCartney and drumming by Ringo Starr, it became a sizable hit. The laid-back Gone Troppo appeared in 1982, and then Harrison didn’t record for another five years.
Keeping to himself for much of the Eighties, Harrison laid low at homes in England and Maui while pursuing such hobbies as Formula One car racing and gardening. He re-emerged in 1987 with Cloud Nine, a spirited comeback. “We used real guitars, real keyboards, real drums and real people playing real songs,” he noted wryly. Co-produced by Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, Cloud Nine was Harrison’s most Beatles-esque solo record. Harrison had softened in his attitude toward the Beatles, as evidenced by the comically poignant “When We Was Fab.” The album yielded Harrison’s third Number One hit, “Got My Mind Set On You,” an infectious soul remake.
Harrison’s next project was the Traveling Wilburys, a low-key supergroup consisting of Harrison, Lynne, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and Roy Orbison. It was Harrison’s first band since the Beatles. Their low-key albums – Volume One (1988) and Vol. 3 (1990) – were as pleasurable as they were unexpected. In 1992, Harrison undertook a tour of Japan (his first since the Dark Horse debacle 18 years earlier) with Eric Clapton and his band. The two-disc set Live in Japan was released in June of 1992. At the time he enthused, “Maybe it’s time to do some playing in England and Europe… maybe eventually even America.” But that would not come to pass.
The last 10 years of Harrison’s life were largely lived out of the limelight. In I Me Mine, a book of lyrics with autobiographical notes, Harrison wrote: “I’m really quite simple. I don’t want to be in the business full time because I’m a gardener. I plant flowers and watch them grow. I don’t go out to clubs and partying. I stay at home and watch the river flow.”
In 2000, All Things Must Pass was reissued in a two-CD box under Harrison’s auspices. He re-recorded its most famous track as “My Sweet Lord (2000)” and added several bonus tracks, as well as candid notes: “It’s been 30 years since All Things Must Pass was recorded… All these years later I would like to liberate some of the songs from the big production that seemed appropriate at the time, but now seem a bit over the top with the reverb in the wall of sound. Still, it was an important album for me and a timely vehicle for all the songs I’d been writing during the last period with the Beatles.”
He also worked on his final solo album, Brainwashed, up until his death. Brainwashed, co-produced by son Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne, was released posthumously in 2002. He wrote one last song, a philosophical summing-up entitled “Horse to the Water,” that appeared on British keyboardist Jools Holland’s Small World Big Band. It’s somehow fitting that the quiet Beatle got in a final word before departing the material world.
George Harrison died of lung cancer on November 29, 2001, at a friend’s home in Los Angeles. He was 58 years old. Exactly a year later, Eric Clapton and Olivia Harrison organized The Concert for George – a tribute performance that involved the remaining ex-Beatles, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, as well as concert supervisor Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty and Ravi Shankar. Proceeds went to Harrison’s Material World Charitable Foundation, which he’d founded back in 1973.

Known first as "The Quiet Beatle," George Harrison was a great songwriter who had the misfortune to be surrounded by two stone cold geniuses whose work often obscured his talents. Yet Harrison compositions such as "Something" and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" are as good as anything the Beatles ever recorded. And with his solo debut All Things Must Pass, he stepped completely out of the shadows of his Beatle band mates to reveal himself a powerfully spiritual songwriter with an expansive sense of melody. Harrison was also a gifted, fluid guitarist and hugely influential in introducing the Beatles — and, by extension, the entire Sixties generation – to Eastern religion and musical influences. His devotion to Hinduism was expressed publicly through rock and roll's first massive charity event, the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh.   
Before all that, Harrison was a teen guitarist in thrall to Britain's 1950s skiffle revival — a working class kid with a band called the Rebels. It was Paul McCartney, a schoolmate one year ahead of Harrison, who invited the 15-year-old to jam with the Quarrymen, a group led John Lennon. (Harrison had come three years behind Lennon at his previous school.) This band would become the Beatles — and Harrison would himself become, like Lennon and McCartney, one of his generation's great seekers. His response to fame, however, was to direct that search inside of himself.
As a songwriter, Harrison was continually out-gunned by Lennon-McCartney. The intense trio of songs he contributed to Revolver — "Taxman," "I Want to Tell You," and "Love You To" — would be his most significant contribution to a single Beatles album. He had other classics to his credit, including "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something," his first Beatles A-side, a track which would top the charts in America. (Both came off 1969's Abbey Road) But Harrison also funneled his creativity into the guitar, a suitably introspective pursuit. From his raw, early rock-and-roll influences he extrapolated a wide-ranging and poetic style. In the late sixties, he helped introduce the slide guitar to prominence; he also popularized the 12-string Rickenbacker guitar and its ultra-distinctive sound on 1964's A Hard Day's Night.
Harrison introduced the Byrds to the Rickenbacker; they, in turn, led him to what would become a calling card: the sitar. With the Indian composer Ravi Shankar as his teacher, the guitarist introduced the instrument (which dates to the middle ages) into the Beatles, and rock music, with "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown," off 1965's Rubber Soul. Two years later, Harrison's unique, and principal, contribution to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band would be "Within You Without You," a centerpiece for sitar. It was his experimental sliver of that experimental album, but it also a declaration of his independence. In 1966, the band gave up performing live (which suited the shy, perfectionist Harrison). In 1969, during filming of recording sessions for The Beatles, Harrison quit the band. He returned 12 days later, after negotiations, but he was the first splinter in the band as it finally broke apart in 1970.
Meanwhile, Harrison lived his life increasingly under the guidance of Hinduism. Shankar, who he'd made world famous, had become a close friend, and would remain so for life. He married Pattie Boyd, who he'd met on the set for the Hard Days Night movie, in 1966; in 1969, he bought a private estate in Henley-on-Thames called Friar Park. Creatively, he'd clearly built a head of steam. His Wonderwall Music soundtrack (Wonderwall Music, 1968) was the first solo effort from a Beatle, and as a ramshackle mix of traditional Indian music and rock, hardly one for the screaming fans. For Electronic Music (1969), he partnered with composers like Bernie Krause for an exercise in Moog synthesizer noodling.
Throat cleared, he then released All Things Must Pass, a three-record, Number One album of songs he'd originally written for the Beatles. It would become his masterwork. Produced by Phil Spector and featuring guests Eric Clapton and Traffic's Dave Mason, the record produced "My Sweet Lord," his biggest solo hit. That this achingly tender evocation of his religious beliefs was eventually shown, in civil court, to have its melody taken from a sixties hit by Chiffons ("He's So Fine") did little to dull its resonance. (It was determined that Harrison "unknowingly" plagiarized the song. In 1976 he would have a hit with Thirty Three & 1/3's "This Song," a kidding take on the lawsuit featuring vocals by Eric Idle of Monty Python.)
Harrison followed this statement of faith with another, even larger-scale gesture, putting together with Ravi Shankhar a massive 1971 benefit for Bangladeshi refuges. Performers at the two Madison Square Garden concerts included Bob Dylan — who alone gave a historic show — Eric Clapton, and Ringo Starr. The shows and resulting documentary and three-record album (both called Concert for Bangladesh) provided a minor hit for Harrison, "Bangla Desh," and millions for the intended beneficiaries. (Another asterisk: the majority of this money was held up for 10 years while Apple records was audited by the IRS.)
Picking up where "My Sweet Lord" left off — and capturing the easy-going uplift of the times, lacing it with his slide guitar — Harrison picked up another Number One single with 1973's "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)," off Living in the Material World. The next year he released Dark Horse on his own label of the same name, but despite the title track's climb to Number 15, the mellow times seemed to evaporate. Harrison and Pattie Boyd would not officially divorce until 1977, but Boyd had already taken up with Eric Clapton, whom she would later marry. In a bizarre move, Harrison had the two cover "Bye Bye Love," an Everly Brothers hit, with him. Worse yet, on his big U.S. tour with Pandit Ravi Shankar & Friends, Harrison's voice, never strong, seem to fail him. A backlash reared up. And with that, he shrunk from one major spotlight: Those were his last shows in the United States.
Between 1975 and 1979, Harrison kept plugging away, to unspectacular commercial and critical results. Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975) and 33 1?3 (1977) were more the work of a (still talented) journeyman than a seeker, although the latter album produced a stalwart fan favorite in "Crackerbox Palace." (Critic Robert Christgau, never a Harrison fan, wrote that the song was "the best thing he's written since 'Here Comes the Sun.'") The slick George Harrison (1979) didn't juice his mojo, either. But he had other things going for him: Besides his passion for Formula 1 racing (celebrated in Harrison's "Faster"), there was his 1978 marriage to Olivia Arias, mother to his son Dhani, who he would spend the rest of his life with. In 1979, he self-published a loose memoir, I Me Mine, and began executive producing Monty Python films. Still, his next album, Somewhere in England, encountered trouble even before it was released. Warner Bros. (parent to Harrison's Dark Horse) demanded the replacement of four songs.
On December 8, 1980, John Lennon was assassinated by Mark Chapman. Harrison hadn't reconciled with Lennon after the breakup of the Beatles. I Me Mine didn't even mention Lennon, and when Lennon reached out to Harrison after discovering this, Harrison did not respond. His public statement offered a reserved, if not especially profound or feeling, conclusion: "To rob life is the ultimate robbery in life." Harrison reframed "All Those Years Ago," a song originally about Ringo Starr, to honor Lennon, and added it to the reworked Somewhere in England. The song went to Number Two.
Harrison hit musical bottom with the 1982 bomb Gone Troppo, and retreated from the studio and stage for years. He made an uncharacteristically brash return in 1987 with Cloud Nine, which featured George in mirrored shades on its cover. The record went platinum and delivered a sticky Number One hit "Got My Mind Set on You," a song derived from an obscure sixties number by Rudy Clark. Whatever the state of Harrison's inner focus, it wasn't probed here. But producer Jeff Lynne (of Electric Light Orchestra) helped Harrison lay on a fine sheen, and kept him to a tidy 11 tracks.
Late Eighties rock was, briefly, very good to George Harrison. Before long he and Lynne hooked up with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison to record a song for Harrison — which led to the Traveling Wilburys, the last word on the rock super group. Their two albums — the irrepressible Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 (1988) and scattershot Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3 (1990) — goosed the careers of all involved, and led to Harrison's 1991 tour of Japan with Eric Clapton, which in turn led to the solid Live in Japan.
After this, Harrison returned to quietude. In 1995, he, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr produced two "new" Beatles songs "Free as a Bird" and "Real Love" for The Beatles Anthology documentary and albums. In 1998, at Linda McCartney's funeral, the three appeared in public together for the first time in 30 years. Also in 1998, Harrison revealed he had been treated for throat cancer, and he was soon beset by more difficulty: On December 30, 1999, a mentally unstable man named Michael Abram broke into the Friar Park estate, lured Harrison out of his bedroom, and stabbed him repeatedly. The attack finally ended when Abram collapsed from injuries sustained when Olivia Harrison fought him off with a fireplace poker.
Harrison continued to suffer from cancer, an on November 29, 2001, at only 58 years old, Harrison died of the disease. He was memorialized around the world. On the first anniversary of his death, McCartney, Starr and many of Harrison's other friends gathered for the Concert for George, which benefited the Material World Charitable Foundation. McCartney and Starr collaborated on "For You Blue," Eric Clapton and Jeff Lynne performed "Here Comes the Sun," and all artists at the concert gathered for several Harrison classics, including "Something" and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps." Brainwashed, which Harrison had been working on with his son Dhani just before his death, was released in 2002 to warm critical reception. In 2004 Harrison was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist (the Beatles were inducted in 1988), and in 2009 EMI released Let it Roll: Songs by George Harrison, a career-spanning compilation.
Shortly after his death, Harrison's family issued a statement that summed up his legacy: "He left this world as he lived in it, conscious of God, fearless of death and at peace, surrounded by family and friends. He often said, 'Everything else can wait but the search for God cannot wait, and love one another.'"

 The floodgates opened almost immediately after the Beatles breakup with the three-LP set All Things Must Pass. Producer Phil Spector packed the studio with musicians, imbuing the already epic likes of “Isn’t It a Pity,” “Let It Down,” and “Art of Dying” with gargantuan grandeur.  
 Harrison’s next move was to organize the all-star benefit show documented on The Concert for Bangla Desh. Though Bob Dylan and Ravi Shankar are the top performers here, George’s set has plenty of magic. 
 On a purely sonic level, Material World is preferable to All Things Must Pass; you can hear the instrumental details much better without Spector’s wall of sound, and the tunes rank among Harrison’s prettiest. But the atmosphere sometimes gets deflated by overly preachy lyrics.  
 Apparently, no one told George that he shouldn’t make an album while suffering from laryngitis, and so we got Dark Horse, which ruins several decent songs with croaky vocals.  
 Dipping back into his vat of unreleased Sixties compositions, Harrison pulled out “Beautiful Girl,” one of the many highlights of his upbeat return to pop form, Thirty-Three & 1/3.  
 The Best of George Harrison takes half its contents from Beatles albums, which is a little insulting to his solo career to date. 
 Another Beatles outtake, “Not Guilty,” surfaced on George Harrison. The understated gem “Your Love Is Forever” is the next best track, but elsewhere mellowness overwhelms musicality.  
 Warner Bros. rejected the first version of Somewhere in England, and even the released version is hard to fathom. Why, for example, are there two Hoagy Carmichael songs? And why is “All Those Years Ago,” supposedly a serious tribute to Lennon, so damn bouncy? 
 The dynamic, synth-driven “Wake Up My Love” opens Gone Troppo and the spooky “Circles” (yet another lost Beatles song) closes it, but there ain’t much in between. 
 On Cloud Nine, Harrison sounds rejuvenated. Hooking up with Beatle junkie Jeff Lynne yielded George’s strongest batch of tunes in over a decade, though weirdly enough, the biggest hit, “Got My Mind Set On You,” was a cover of a Rudy Clark song. 
 Following his death from cancer in 2001, some of the tracks he was working on toward the end of his life came out on Brainwashed.  
 Let it Roll is a single-disc best-of that covers Harrison’s whole career; for Beatles songs, it uses live versions from The Concert For Bangladesh.

 Cherished by fans and collectors since its first publication in 1980, I, Me, Mine is now available in paperback. The closest we will come to George Harrison's autobiography, it features George in conversation with The Beatles' spokesperson Derek Taylor, discussing everything from early Beatlemania to his love of gardening. The lyrics to over 80 of his songs, many in his own hand, are accompanied by his uniquely intimate and humorous commentary. Fifty archival photographs of George with The Beatles and solo capture a journey of creative and spiritual transformation. Brimming with the wit, warmth, and grace that characterized his life, and with an introduction by his wife, Olivia, I, Me, Mine is a treasured portrait of George Harrison and his music.

       A 400-page memoir from the Quiet Beatle? Can it be? Well, yes and no: only about 60 pages of this earnest tome, originally published in 1980, are devoted to Harrison's recollections of life before, during and (notably) after the Beatles. His memories, which manage to feel fresh and distant at the same time, come to readers via transcripts of his conversations with Derek Taylor (1932-1997), the Beatles press officer and ghostwriter of Brian Epstein's memoir. Harrison (1943-2001) was only in his late 30s when I Me Mine came out-the Beatles had formed, changed music forever and disbanded before his 28th birthday. The rest of this volume consists of photos with whimsical captions ("the author enjoying a cheese sandwich with some friends" is assigned to a picture of Harrison with a sitar) and facsimiles of his handwritten lyrics (including a fairly different version of "Taxman"), each accompanied by a brief explanation (ideas expressed in "It's All Too Much," for example, were inspired by LSD and "confirmed in meditation"). Most of the songs were composed after Harrison's immersion in Hinduism; divorced from their melodies, lyrics espousing love, peace and harmony tend to take on a certain sameness. This volume offers much to Beatles zealots, but for the casual fan, Harrison will likely remain as admirable and as inscrutable as ever. B&w photos and illustrations throughout.

       Guitars gently wept the world over November 29, 2001, when  George Harrison succumbed to cancer. Originally released in  1980, this volume includes some very casual recollections by  "the quiet one" about his life, including his Liverpool  childhood and interest in music, meeting the other kids who  would become the 20th century's most influential band, his  fascination with Eastern religions, and more. The book features  roughly 50 photos taken throughout his life, but the meat of the  book is the more than 80 song lyricsDmany of which are  reproductions of his hand-written sheets with corrections  intactDalong with background on each. There is also a new  introduction by Harrison's widow. For millions of diehard fans,  there is no such thing as too much information on the Beatles,  so this should circulate well.

  Be warned that this is not an autobiography in its entirety. However, it contains the most true biographical content you will find in print about George Harrison. This book is made up of three parts. The first is a short biographical section written by George himself, and by a man by the name of Derek Taylor, a very close friend of George's. While that section is far shorter than any curious fan of George's would like, it is none the less very entertaining, and funny. A true "Must Read", if you will. The second section is the words to nearly all of his songs that were written prior to 1980, when the book first came out. Along with the words are a comment from George about each song. Many of the comments are quite amusing and insightful. The third section is made up of photographs. This edition also comes with an introduction to the writing of this book by George's wife, Olivia, that is truely endearing. If you want to begin to get an idea of George Harrison's sense of humor and personal views on a wide variety of subjects, and if you just plain love George Harrison, GET THIS BOOK! Amen.
  As an inveterate Beatles' fan, it comes as no surprise that I would heartily endorse this book.  Long dubbed the Quiet Beatle and other similar cliches, George Harrison does indeed offer his voice and reflections in this work.  Always a private man, George's wordings here can be described as almost cryptic.This work provides readers with a "glimpse" of George growing up; the former Beatle describes his working class roots in Liverpool, his musical muse and later, his work as a gifted composer, guitarist and lyricist.  Indeed, George Harrison has expanded musical horizons; in 1965 he became enamored of the sitar and included it on several songs on "Rubber Soul" and later collections.His lifelong quest for spiritual knowledge and core belief system are explored; indeed, it is in his own words he explains that he does not follow an "organized" or "traditional" religion, but rather bases his spiritual feelings around his internal beliefs.I like the input the artist's wife Olivia offered; her words are a welcome and added treat to this work.  Indeed, it is Olivia's contribution that make the reissue of this work even better and more effective in touching readers.
It has never been acceptable merely to be passionate about The Beatles collectively: You MUST have a personal favorite. John Lennon was always mine, by dint of his court jester persona and his wordsmithing, with George Harrison a close second. Being shy myself, I identified with the so-called Quiet Beatle and liked his scornful "don't bother me" attitude, which was integral to so many of his songs. Harrison's meticulous and versatile guitar work, never show-offish and always tasteful, was my main inspiration for wanting to learn to play, too. The Beatle least comfortable with his immortality, Harrison could be openly contemptuous of Beatlemania and often referred to himself ruefully as Beatle George, a title he felt he could never live down. Off-putting to some, maybe, his cantankerousness only made Harrison more interesting to me.Predictably, Harrison takes a larkish approach to telling his life story. In his foreword, he facetiously calls "I Me Mine" (named after a forgettable tune from "Let It Be") "a little ego detour," but the book's tone is actually rather self-effacing. It's not an autobiography per se, although there is a six chapter text section that hits the high points of Harrison's life up until that time (late Seventies) and allows the mystical Beatle to rhapsodize on some of his passions: spirituality, gardening and, surprisingly, Formula One motor racing. Written by Harrison in a conversational style, with extensive "notes" by longtime Beatles confidant/press officer Derek Taylor, the text is a rambling sketch of a very private man determined to stay that way. (A clue to Harrison's reticence is found in the book's "backword," where he includes the cryptic quote, "Tell not all that you know because he who tells all that he knows, often tells more than he knows.Read more ›
  I was lucky to find an old copy of this in the library about five years ago. With respect to a few changes, this new edition is the same book, though. The different cover is a great improvement, and Olivia Harrison's introduction is fabulous. I Me Mine is long on class & presentation. Unfortunately, it's also a little short on autobiography.George's wit and surreal humor shines through (such as the sitar being called a cheese sandwich in the picture captions), but I felt frustrated that I didn't know much more about the man and his motivations than I did before.It's no secret that George was obsessed with Krishna. Being an agnostic, I would like to know as to how & why his belief became so strong. In interviews, George had intimated that with chanting the Krishna mantra a person could "see God, play with Him...." I think George was a great songwriter and an interesting guy and I mean no disrespect, but couldn't it have just been the drugs? It would have definitely been interesting to read George's descriptions of events like this.Another regret is that George doesn't describe his relationships with the other Beatles more. I've read that he was frequently irritated by Paul and apparently had a complex friendship with John. Maybe there was a concern that such an approach would be gossipy, but I would like to know why Lennon/McCartney balked at such great songs as All Things Must Pass, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Not Guilty, etc., etc. George's perspective on this would have been most welcome.Along with these quibbles, there is much more to admire. George's dry wit is manifest on every page, and the handwritten lyrics are a great bonus. Derek Taylor's comments are also very witty and insightful. This is a definite must-have for admirers of the Dark Horse. I hope Olivia Harrison eventually writes an autobiography; it would be the perfect companion to I Me Mine.
      I bought this as a gift for my son, but I hope he lets me read it somewhere down the line.  George has always been a hero to me. James B. Wiser
      This is part of George Harrison's life story.  I wished for  more.  He centers more on his songs, how they were written and for who, and of the Beatles.
      This book is OK, but just OK.  I'm a Beatles fan and so purchase virtually anything relating to the Fab Four.
      A very well "pictured" profile of a very special human being, and a gifted musician and song writer...
      I have read a lot of biographies.  One thing I like to do is read every biography from the Penguin Lives series.  This book I Me Mine is not a biography at all.
      A very close, personal and rare look into the life and point of view of a much beloved icon.  I was captivated.
      " I have been a beatles fan since February 9th. 1964...the night they first appeared on the ole ed Sullivan show! this book taught me a bit more about my favorite beatle..
      Great service and a wonderful book. I would not call it an autobiography but a way for George to have his own say in how people look at him.
      This book is not a book about his life, so much, as it features his songs written in his hand writing.
      Greatest book in the world about a great sensitive wonderful spiritual, most talented human being who was gifted the most in all the Beatles.
