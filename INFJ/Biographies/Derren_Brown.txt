This article is about the English illusionist and mentalist.  For the British guitarist, see Darren Brown.  For the baseball coach, see Daren Brown.
Derren Brown (born 27 February 1971)[3] is a British illusionist, mentalist, trickster, hypnotist, painter, writer, and sceptic. He is known for his appearances in television specials, stage productions, and British television series such as Trick of the Mind and Trick or Treat. Since the first broadcast of his show Derren Brown: Mind Control in 2000, Brown has become increasingly well known for his mind-reading act. He has written books for magicians as well as the general public.
Though his performances of mind-reading and other feats of mentalism may appear to be the result of psychic or paranormal practices, he claims no such abilities and frequently denounces those who do. Brown states at the beginning of his Trick of the Mind programmes that he achieves his results using a combination of "magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship".
Brown was born to Chris and Bob Brown[4] in Purley, England, and has a brother nine years his junior.[5] Brown was privately educated at Whitgift School in South Croydon (where his father coached swimming),[5] and studied Law and German[6] at the University of Bristol.[7] While there, he attended a hypnotist show by Martin S Taylor, which inspired him to turn to illusion and hypnosis as a career.[8] Whilst an undergraduate, he started working as a conjuror, performing the traditional skills of close-up magic in bars and restaurants. In 1992, he started performing stage shows at the University of Bristol under the stage name Darren V. Brown.[1]
Brown was an Evangelical Christian in his teens, and became an atheist in his twenties. This is discussed by Brown in the "Messiah" special, and in his book Tricks of the Mind.[9] An interview as part of Richard Dawkins' two-part documentary series The Enemies of Reason, where Brown explained various psychological techniques used by purported psychics and spiritual mediums to manipulate their audiences, Brown also said he sought to strengthen his belief and provide answers to common criticisms of religion by reading the Bible and other Christian religious texts, but upon doing so found none of the answers he sought and came to the conclusion that his belief (in Christianity) had no basis.[10]
The Big Issue website described Brown as being "playfully mendacious".[11] Although it has been said that Brown is banned from every casino in Britain,[12] other sources report that casinos welcome the publicity from his visits.[11]
In an interview with the Independent in 2007 Brown stated that he is gay.[13] In an interview with the Radio Times in 2011 Brown talked more about his sexuality, stating that he is blissfully happy in a relationship. He said, "I spent a lot of time thinking about me and working on what I wanted to be before I came into a relationship. In some ways, it's bad because you come into relationship quite late without a lot of experience and you have a lot to learn. But that can also be exciting. Certainly, it's lovely to have somebody love you and it's lovely to love someone else."[14]
Since 2004 Brown has been the patron of the registered charity the Parrot Zoo Trust at Friskney in eastern Lincolnshire near Boston, England.[15] In an interview with LeftLion magazine he said "I'm a big fan of parrots – I think they're fascinating creatures. Many of them live for longer than us humans and it's interesting to me the way they learn to mimic human voices even though they don't really comprehend what they're saying."[16]
Brown heavily relies on misdirection for his tricks, helped by the audience viewing him as having deep psychological insights. He relies on a wide array of techniques to prevent audiences from deducing the techniques he has used.[17]
In a Daily Telegraph article published in 2003 Simon Singh criticised Brown's early TV appearances, arguing that he presented standard magic and mentalism effects—such as the classic Ten Card Poker Deal trick—as genuine psychological manipulation.[18] On Brown's television and live shows he often appears to show the audience how a particular effect was created—claiming to use techniques such as subliminal suggestion, hypnosis, and body language reading. Singh's suggestion is that these explanations are dishonest. Furthermore, Singh took exception to the programme's website being categorised under Channel 4's "Science" section. The mini-site was moved to Entertainment for later series.
In an October 2010 interview, Brown conceded that Singh may have had a point, explaining that at the start of his television career "I was overstating the case, overstating my skills. I thought there'll only be one show, there'll never be a repeat, so I might as well go for it."[19] In his book Tricks of the Mind, Brown writes,
"I am often dishonest in my techniques, but always honest about my dishonesty. As I say in each show, 'I mix magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship'. I happily admit cheating, as it's all part of the game. I hope some of the fun for the viewer comes from not knowing what's real and what isn't. I am an entertainer first and foremost, and I am careful not to cross any moral line that would take me into manipulating people's real-life decisions or belief systems."
Brown claims to never use actors or "stooges" in his work without informing the viewers. In Tricks of the Mind, Brown writes that to use such a ploy is "artistically repugnant and simply unnecessary"; furthermore, he "would not want any participant to watch the TV show when it airs and see a different or radically re-edited version of what he understood to have happened".[9]
Brown uses a variety of methods to achieve his illusions including traditional magic/conjuring techniques, memory techniques, hypnosis, body language reading, cognitive psychology, cold reading and psychological, subliminal (specifically the use of PWA – "perception without awareness") and ideomotor suggestion.
In an interview in New Scientist in 2005, when asked how he "acquired his psychological skills", Brown says that he learnt skills as a hypnotist, which he was not sure how to apply until he started performing close-up magic. When asked whether he is able to detect lies, Brown claimed to be able to read subtle cues such as a micro-muscle movements that indicate to him if someone is lying. Concerning his apparent success at hypnotizing people, he stated that he can normally spot a suggestible type of person and chooses that person to be his participant. He believes that the presence of a television camera also increases suggestibility.[20]
Several authors have claimed that Brown uses neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) in his act which "consists of a range of magical 'tricks', misdirection and, most intriguing, setting up audiences to provide the response that he wishes them to provide by using subtle subliminal cues in his conversation with them."[21] In response to the accusation that he unfairly claims to be using NLP whenever he performs, Brown writes "The truth is I have never mentioned it outside of my book". Brown does have an off-stage curiosity about the system, and discusses it in the larger context of hypnotism and suggestion.[9][22] In his book Tricks of the Mind, Brown mentions that he attended an NLP course with Richard Bandler, co-creator of NLP and mentor of Paul McKenna. He also describes the NLP concept of eye accessing cues as a technique of "limited use" in his book Pure Effect.[23] The language patterns which he uses to suggest behaviours are very similar in style to those used by Richard Bandler and by the hypnotist from whom Bandler learnt his skill, Milton H. Erickson. Brown also mentions in Tricks of the Mind that NLP students were given a certificate after a four-day course, certifying them to practice NLP as a therapist. A year after Brown attended the class, he received a number of letters saying that he would receive another certificate, not for passing a test (as he discontinued practising NLP following the course), but for keeping in touch. After ignoring their request, he later received the new certificate for NLP in his mailbox, unsolicited.[24]
Brown appeared in a skit at the beginning of the 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Deal or No Deal special (a cross between 8 Out of 10 Cats and Deal or No Deal).[26]
He was also mentioned briefly in the 50th anniversary special of the British television show Doctor Who.[27]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Derren Brown was born on February 27, 1971 in Croydon, Surrey, England as Derren Victor Brown. He is a producer and writer, known for Derren Brown: The Heist (2006), Derren Brown: An Evening of Wonders (2009) and Derren Brown: The System (2008).
      His show, Something Wicked This Way Comes, won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment Show 2006.
      A principle demonstrated at one of his stage shows, of how the distraction of counting ping-pong ball transits prevents one from noticing the guys in gorilla suits entering the edge of vision, was used in a Mayor of London 2008 awareness campaign advert that alerted motorists to the need for looking out for unexpected cyclists.
      Owned a parrot called Figaro for ten years, that went to live at The National Parrot Sanctuary in Friskney, Lincolnshire, UK, before passing away.
      (Talking about two of his TV shows) "Seems The Séance has become the most complained-about show. It received 700 complaints. I might add that the prospect of me blowing my head off on live TV last year attracted only twenty. Fair enough, I suppose."
      I was inspired by a stage hypnotist, but I didn't really want to do that - I didn't want to make people look stupid. So I started doing magic. But the trouble with magic is that it's either naff or, however good a trick it is, you know it's just a trick. It's inherently quite patronising. If you say, 'When I click my fingers the coin travels through the air,' you know it's rubbish.
      I am embarrassingly incompetent at football or any kind of team sport. I'm so bad it would anger you.
      (on finding a partner) If it happens, it happens, you know. The more you go out and look for it, the worse you make it for yourself. One day someone will turn up - or they won't. But I'm sure one day they will.

Derren Brown's Real NameDerren Victor BrownAliasesDarren V. Brown, Darren BrownOccupationMentalist, Magician, Painter, Writer, SkepticPlace of BirthPurley, South London, EnglandHeight5' 9 1/2" EyesBrownHairGingerAbilitiesDerren possesses the uncanny ability to apparently read peoples thoughts at will. Though his feats of mentalism may appear to be the result of psychic or paranormal practices, Brown achieves his results using a combination of magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship. Interesting FactDerren owned a parrot called Figaro for ten years, that went to live at The National Parrot Sanctuary in Friskney, Lincolnshire, UK, before passing away.
Derren Brown was born on February 27, 1971 in Purly, South London, England. He attended Whitgift School - where his father coached swimming, and attended the University of Bristol, where he studied Law and German. While there, he witnessed a show performed by hypnotist Martin Taylor, which inspired Brown to pursue magic and hypnosis as a career. In the early 90's, he was working as a close-up magician in bars and restaurants.  Then in 1992, Brown started performing stage hypnosis shows at the University of Bristol under the alias Darren V. Brown. 
In 1999 he was asked by Channel 4 to put a mind-reading program together.Brown began his television work with three sixty-minute specials produced over two years. Since the first broadcast of his Channel 4 television show "Derren Brown: Mind Control" in 2000, he has become increasingly well known for his "mind-reading" act. In 2003 he started touring the UK performing his first live stage show and produced another Channel 4 series entitled "Trick of the Mind," which aired on April 23, 2004. On October 5, 2003, Brown performed his most controversial stunt to date, playing Russian roulette live on Channel 4 (though with a slight delay in case the stunt was not successful). Because of the British gun laws banning the possession of handguns, the stunt supposedly had to be performed outside of Britain, at an undisclosed secret location. The stunt was condemned by senior British police officers, apparently fearful of copycat acts.
 Several commentators also suggested that the show was a mere hoax. He also presented a special show for Channel 4 on 31 May 2004 called "Séance" in which he brought 12 members of the public together to re-create a séance.Brown has since produced a stream of other Channel 4 specials including "Trick of the Mind," "Trick or Treat," "The Events" and "Derren Brown Investigates." He has written four books on magic: "Absolute Magic," "Pure Effect,"  "Tricks of the Mind" and "Confessions of a Conjuror;"  as well as a video - "The Devil's Picturebook."In 2011, Derren will launch his live tour entitled "Svengali."

=======================================================
Master mindbender Derren became fascinated with the world of magic and illusion at an early age. While studying Law and German at the University of Bristol, he began working as a traditional conjurer, performing close-up magic in pubs. By 1992, his work manipulating the mind had begun and he staged his first hypnosis shows at university.
Asked to put together a mind-reading show for Channel 4 in 1999, it was originally going to be hosted by his magician pal Andy Nyman, who turned it down. Derren hosted the show, and a new TV superstar was born. A master of the power of suggestion, Derren’s unique brand of illusion bewitched us all, and he’s since gone on to present five series and eight specials, each more ambitious than the last.
Through shows like The Heist, Messiah, Seance and The Gathering, amongst other things Derren’s convinced a group of people to rob a security van at gunpoint without directly telling them to do so, and convinced people that he can not only contact their dead relatives, but that he can also read their thoughts and dreams.
Along the way he’s debunked myths, charlatans and so-called psychics, transforming the way we look at magic and confronting us with the uncomfortable idea that we’re all far more suggestible than we like to believe.
Alongside his TV work, Derren’s also published four magic books and one of his wonderfully bizarre caricatures and paintings. He currently lives with his boyfriend Mark, a graphic designer.
