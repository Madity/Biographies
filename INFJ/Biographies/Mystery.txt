Erik Von Markovik, also known as Mystery, is the originator of the majority of pick up artist knowledge. 
Mystery has been and remains perhaps the most influential thinkers of the community. Today he provides services through Venusian Arts and has risen to celebrity status through his reality TV show "The Pick Up Artist" on VH-1 (two seasons) and the semi biographical account of his activities in Neil Strauss' The Game.
Due to his having invented many of the key principles of what is today known as pick up artistry, he is well respected by the seduction/ pick up artist community. 
Mystery's concepts and dating techniques have been inspired upon in some way for the creation of most of the training materials and products in the dating world today.
Many of the concepts and techniques used in dating advice and the pick up artist community today were created by Mystery. Mystery encapsulates and refers to these as Mystery Method and the Venusian Arts. These methods have been summarized in various books: The Venusian Arts Handbook (2003), The Mystery Method (2006), Revelation (2010).
Peacocking - this is a term Mystery created which entails having at least one interesting thing about your appearance. This can be integrated in your clothes and accessories; something noticeable and uncommon, making it easy to capture a girl's attention and make her initiate a conversation with you.
Cat Theory - Mystery defines this term as the method of engaging with women subtly, just to hold their attention.
Group Theory - An approach to meet women when they are out in groups including techniques to deal with the target (girl you are interested in) and her friends and men in the group.
Neg - a slightly degrading (but not too offensive) compliment, with the sole purpose of snubbing a target.
False Disqualification - the result that "Neg" attempts to obtain, snubbing the target and subconsciously making her show you that she is worthy. 
Qualify - the process by which a target exerts effort on proving that she is deserving of your attention. This also saves you the trouble of having to get past protective friends since she voices her interest on her own.
Aside from these, Mystery's specialty advice also consists of step-by-step procedural tips on maintaining emotional balance, developing the proper mind and skill set, and using these in preparation of approaching women and hooking-up with them.
"I’m dressing for the outrageous club girls, the hot slutty girls, the ones I could never get.  They’re playing groupie, so I've gotta play rock star."
        Mystery (Erik von Markovik) was born Erik James Horvat-Markovic in Toronto, Canada. He grew up and lived there until his late 20s when he moved to L.A. to develop his career as a magician, and later a Pick Up Artist. He has one brother.
In his early life Mystery was fascinated by Magic, and notes that David Copperfield was an idol. He learned to perform magic tricks, worked at kids party's and eventually had his own agent and worked as a magician entertainer full time.
Mystery was not always good at getting with women. He openly admits that he had difficulty in picking women up early in his life and often spent his time playing Dungeons and Dragons while honing his skills as a magician. He had sex for the first time when he was 21 years old.
By the year 2000, Mystery, by his own account, was getting paid $1,500 per night to work as a magician and mentalist at corporate events. He even made an appearance on CTV's late-night Open Mike talk show with Mike Bullard. His act was named "Natural Magic".
However, to make it as a magician, he knew he would have to become known in the U.S. So he moved to Los Angeles, where he spent over a year trying to land himself a television spot that would showcase his talent as a magician. However, his money ran out before he found it and he had to return to Toronto.
He was now 29, and back in Toronto was unable to get the gigs he has usually got and as a consequence was broke. He moved in with his brother.
Now 2001, Mystery was already putting his skills with magic to another use in a new role, as a pick up artist. The unlucky turn of events with his career in magic effectively forced him to turn to his talent as a pick up artist to make money.
Mystery has a daughter born in mid 2008. Little is publicly known about the mother of the child, although she was seen in 2009 and 2010 in public with Mystery.
On April 1st 2011 an email was sent out from Venusian Arts announcing that Mystery (Erik von Markovik) had met an unfortunate accident and died. The email created a lot of speculation but turned out to be an April Fool's joke. 	
		        Mystery spent many years developing his knowledge about pick up artistry by frequenting bars, clubs and strip joints in the Toronto area. He says of this period of his life, that he would sometimes go out 7 nights a week to practice and would often be 'itching' to go out. It became his passion.
Mystery was heavily influenced by his role as a magician and entertainer in the way he approached pick up artistry. He used 'routines' similar to the way entertainers such as magicians and comedians used them. 
Mystery first appeared on the pick up artist scene on April 15th 1997 when he posted on a seduction community Internet forum replying to someone else's post. 
Very quickly, by 1998 he had become one of the most prominent members of the forum, having revealed many parts of his approach and mindsets towards meeting women. His unique and different approach to the current dating gurus of the time (namely Ross Jeffries) often led him into spates with them. But it also helped him to attract a fan base amongst his forum peers.
In 2001 he posted to the forum that he would run the first field bootcamp for pick up artistry. This was live instruction while the students (men) approached women in bars and clubs. He set the price at $500 per student and five men took him up on that offer, one of them being Style (Neil Strauss). They would quickly become close friends and wingmen.
In the same year Mystery stopped posting on the public seduction forums, saying that there was too much noise for it to be useful. He created his own private forum named "Mystery's Lounge". He only invited people that had proven themselves in field, and that had been met face to face by himself or other Lounge members. The forum became a coveted place that students would seek to gain access to.
Over the next few years Mystery would do many more bootcamps, with Style assisting, travelling to Europe and Australia in the process. Some of his students of the time include dating gurus today (e.g. Style, TD (Owen Cook), Papa (Nick Kho), Mehow).
In 2003 he worked with Lovedrop (chris odom) to write the first book describing his "Mystery Method" for picking up women. It was named "The Venusian Arts Handbook". At the same time he would move in to "Project Hollywood" with Style, Papa and Herbal. Project Hollywood was a mansion (the original rat pack mansion) behind sunset boulevard in Hollywood, and was deemed the perfect place to set up a pick up artist lifestyle. It would become the headquarters from which they would run many seminars and pick up artist bootcamps. It was becoming a real business.
In 2004 he partnered with Nick Savoy (Savoy) to found Mystery Method Corporation. Nick Savoy, a Wharton MBA, helped Mystery to build a more scalable business around his coaching and teachings. They would train and recruit many 'pick up coaches' and the company steadily spread its feelers around the world to London, Europe and Australia.
In 2005 Project Hollywood disbanded with Mystery and Style moving out first. Mystery would later set up similar glamorous lifestyle pads with a Project Las Vegas (2006), and still later a Project Miami (2007).
In 2006 Mystery and Nick Savoy separated due to differences in opinion on how they should teach pick up artistry. Nick Savoy remained with Mystery Method Corporation (which later was rebranded to Love Systems) and Mystery went on to create a new company Venusian Arts (with Jamese Matador and Chris Odom) in 2007. The rest of the pick up coaches remained with Nick Savoy and Mystery Method which was to become Love Systems Inc. 
At this time, Mystery was already negotiating and working on his own reality TV series "The Pick Up Artist" with VH-1. In it, Mystery and his wingmen coached eight socially inept men for eight weeks to become pick up artists and compete for the "Master Pick-Up Artist" title.
The show debuted on VH-1 on August 6, 2007 with a relatively disappointing audience of 673,000 viewers. The show's audience improved over the season making it interesting enough for VH-1 to sign Mystery up for Season 2. Season 2 debuted on VH-1 October 12, 2008. 
A third season of The Pick Up Artist is not to be aired. In an interview in 2010 Mystery said he chose to work on a spin off of the series instead of doing a third season of The Pick Up Artist. Other rumors suggest that season 2 wasn't sufficiently popular for VH-1 to continue with a third season.
Mystery continued to be a partner in the Venusian Arts enterprise with Lovedrop (Chris Odom) and James Matador (Stan Tayi), but became less active over time as did Chris Odom and Matador. Mystery spent a number of years mostly off scene after the birth of his daughter, and steadily became more active during 2012. 
Venusian Arts runs coaching bootcamps for men and sells a number of homestudy dating advice courses, and is largely run by its coaching team.
Mystery, joined up with Beckster and Discovery (one of his former proteges at Venusian arts) in November 2013 to form a new company, 3 Second Rule, in the UK. Erik is currently most active in this new company, and back to training on bootcamps and seminars.
Mystery has slept with over 100 women, potentially several hundreds of women and has had an unknown number of girlfriends.
There has been a lot of live video footage recorded of Mystery approaching, meeting and attracting women in bars and clubs. Some of this was originally made available in the "Magnum Opus - Mind of Mystery" DVD series (no longer available).
Many dating gurus and pick up artist instructors were originally trained by Mystery. These include amongst them: Style (Neil Strauss), TD/Tyler Durden (Owen Cook), Sinn, Papa (Nick Kho), MeHow, Lovedrop (Chris Odom), James Matador (Stan Tayi) and others of the original Mystery Method Corporation coaches now become senior Love Systems coaches (e.g. Sheriff).
Mystery has been involved with many very attractive girls and girlfriends. This stretches from models to minor celebrities to strippers to everyday girls. Some of Mystery's girls are criticized for not being 'that attractive'. Mystery does not apologize for this, he likes what he likes. He has a taste for 'gothic' girls at times (these are usually the types he is criticized for). 
Today Erik has retired from the game and settled down in Toronto, Canada with the mother of his daughter "Dakota Breeze". See the photos below of Erik walking with his girlfriend and daughter in Melrose Place in July 2010.
While Erik has now settled down into 'family life' he still flies around the world training men on bootcamps for Venusian Arts.
- Katya Sitnikova: His girlfriend featured in 'The Game'. Katya was a 22 year old girl from Russia working in L.A. as a makeup artist in the entertainment industry. Mystery met her in a club when she was doing make up for runway models. See Mystery's personal video of Katya in News & Media coverage at end of page.
- Mexican girl: Immediately after Katya Mystery was shortly involved with an attractive Mexican girl.

        A lot of Mystery's news and media exposure to date has centered around his promotion of the reality TV show "The Pickup Artist" on VH-1.

The Pickup Artist is an American reality television dating themed game show that aired on VH1.[2] The show was hosted by pickup artist Mystery (Erik von Markovik) and his wings J-Dog (Justin Marks) and James Matador, with Tara Ferguson replacing J-Dog in season 2. The first season featured eight male contestants that had previously been unsuccessful in love and relationships. Throughout the show the contestants are tutored in the art of the "pickup" as taught by Mystery and his wings. In each episode the men were given challenges that involved picking women up in different situations, such as on a bridge during the day or in a nightclub. As the show progressed the men were instructed to pick up women of varying levels of difficulty, such as in the second to last challenge of the first season where the men had to pick up a stripper, described by Mystery as "the ultimate challenge."[3] The winner of the first season was Alvaro "Kosmo" Orlando.
The second season featured nine contestants and aired in October 2008,[4] with the second season's winner being 27-year-old Simeon Moses.
Note 3: Contrary to statements made earlier in the episode, no wing men were allowed to be selected in Episode 5.
The initial viewer ratings were disappointing, debuting with only 673,000 viewers.[5][6] Viewer ratings picked up by the season's end, resulting in the series being picked up for a second season.
Critical reception for the series was mixed, with the AV Club panning the second season's opening episode.[7]
Controversy began to cloud The Pickup Artist after revelations that some of the contestants' livelihoods were not as they were listed on the VH1 show profiles.[8] Alvaro "Kosmo" Orlando had been referred to as a game programmer. But, he actually had been an aspiring actor for the previous four years - working out of Miami, New York, and Los Angeles.[9] Runner-up contestant Brady Sprunger was characterized as a shy photographer. But he had been working for a modeling agency, the Los Angeles based Action Agency, for five full years prior to the show's taping.

Mystery is the stage name and alter-ego of the Canadian author and entertainer Erik Von Markovic. He is most famous for starring as the main character of the book, 'The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of pickup artists' as well as starring on the VH1 reality TV series, 'The Pick-Up Artist.'Early daysMystery was born Erik James Horvat- Markovic on 24 September 1971 in Toronto, Canada. Before moving in to the role of a pickup artist, Markovic worked as a professional magician and earned his money from it, stating the world famous magician David Copperfield as his idol.Markovic made a success of this line of work and was earning up to $1500 a night performing at big corporate events, even appearing on TV. In order to become more of a success, Markovic moved from his home in Toronto to LA in the United States in order to try and land himself into a major television spot. This did not work out and he was forced to move back to Toronto, totally broke.A pick-up artistA pick-up artist is somebody who is an expert in picking up girls. By this, we mean he is a master of seduction. Whilst broke, Markovic began trawling the bars and clubs of Toronto, gaining knowledge and skills as to how to pick up women.He used his experience as a magician to impress girls with tricks and jokes in order to get their attention and he soon found out that this method proved to be very successful. His first indulgence as an advisory pickup artist came when he advertised his live services to men.Five students picked him up on his offer and paid $500 each to receive live, audio instruction from Markovic when approaching women in clubs.Fame and successMarkovic's first mainstream exposure came following his contribution to the book, 'The Venusian Arts Handbook' in which he detailed some of his 'mystery methods.' He continued running seminars and boot camps about pick-up artistry but his fame hit heavy heights when he starred in his own VH1 reality TV series, 'The Pickup Artist' in 2007.Along with this, came his 'Mystery' alter ego and the show and after a disappointing start, it became immensely popular in the U.S. The show saw Mystery take on eight inept men and teach them the art of becoming a pick-up artist.The show followed these men as they learned the tricks of the trade and became more confident when it came to chatting up women.A final wordToday, the show is no longer running but Mystery does continue to run his seminars and boot vamps in LA and he is a minor celebrity.

The persona of Mystery was created by Erik von Markovik in the late 1990′s for his mentalist act, entitled "Natural Magic". He has performed magic shows in many locations, including Toronto, Las Vegas, and Hollywood. The name Mystery was also used by von Markovik as his internet nickname and nom de plume. He is the author of The Mystery Method: How to Get Beautiful Women Into Bed, published by St. Martin's Press.  His book is ranked as the number one book on sex at amazon.com. Mystery exploded onto the underground pickup and seduction scene in the late 1990s with his groundbreaking contributions to the art, and he was the first pickup instructor to offer live, in-field training.
Mystery has trained thousands of students all over the world, including a who’s who of the most respected pickup artists teaching today. A self-proclaimed "late bloomer", Mystery admits that he spent the early years of his life playing Dungeons and Dragons and having limited to no success with women until his early twenties. But his desire to love and be loved by women drove him to go out to nightclubs night after night, practicing and experimenting various ways to engage people in social interactions.

Over a ten year period of trial and error, and many, MANY rejections, Mystery create the Venusian Arts Handbook – an ebook which later became the hardcover book The Mystery Method: How To Get Beautiful Women Into Bed.  By closely examining how people engage each other during the "courtship" phase of a relationship and combining these observations with various theories from evolutionary psychology, he created a system of techniques and strategies developed to help men become better at engaging women in various social situations such as bars, clubs, coffee shops, and pretty much anywhere else. He shared his theories on an internet newsgroup, alt.seduction.fast, and became famous for his analytical approach to the field of seduction, as well as his in-depth "field reports". Mystery is credited with coining a number of terms and concepts in the seduction community. These concepts are borrowed from evolutionary psychology and theatrical showmanship, and his experience as a magician. Some terms Mystery is credited for include:
Set A group of two or more people comprised of both men and women that a man would have to approach and befriend in order to be able to woo his "target" girl.
Peacocking - Dressing to stand out, or to have an item of clothing or an accessory that looks interesting, allowing the girl to comment on it if she is interested in starting a conversation with you.
The 3-second Rule – If you see a girl you are interested in, you must approach her within three seconds or you will over-think things and create too much approach anxiety, and you will risk her seeing you staring at her.
Neg – A backhanded compliment intended to snub a potential mate ("target"), telegraph a lack of interest ("false disqualification"), and encourage the target to prove her worth ("qualify").
Though seminars and workshops on seduction technique preceded his involvement, Mystery is credited with introducing "in-field" workshops, in which small groups of students were appraised on their technique as they approached unaffiliated women in bars and nightclubs. Mystery himself has trained many of the most notable and most respected instructors from the world's top dating companies, many of which still teach his methods with their own personal "twist". Mystery instructed and then befriended author Neil Strauss (AKA Style), who went on to become Mystery's 'wingman', and ultimately a mentor in the seduction community himself. Together with a number of other former students, Mystery and Strauss shared a large residence in Hollywood ('Project Hollywood'), which soon became a central point for aspiring students.  Mystery gained international prominence when his exploits were documented in Strauss' 2005 bestseller The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists. On April 11, 2007, Mystery appeared on the television show Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote his book The Mystery Method: How to get Beautiful Women into Bed.  He has since been invited back for a second guest spot. Mystery has also been featured in a number of magazines, newspapers, and interviews and held his first college seminar on May 4, 2006 at MIT. On August 6, 2007, the series premiere of Mystery's television show The Pick-up Artist aired on VH1, transforming him almost overnight into a pop icon in the United States. So much so that the “Brian Williams/Feist” episode of Saturday Night Live on November 3, 2007 started with a sketch in which Darrell Hammond played Bill Clinton at a Halloween party, dressed up as Mystery.  In the series, Mystery and his wingmen trained eight "lonely, socially inept" men in an eight week bootcamp in Austin, Texas to compete for the title of "Master Pick-Up Artist". The show was successful enough to warrant a second season, which premiered on October 12, 2008. Mystery is the author of the book The Mystery Method: How To Get Beautiful Women Into Bed. Mystery currently owns the company The Venusian Arts. He has received several notable awards within the seduction community. Mystery has been ranked as one of the Top 10 Pick-up Artists Of The Year for the last seven years, even reaching the top spot in 2007 (it should also be noted that many of his former students, including Neil Strauss (AKA Style) are regularly included in these top 10 lists as well). He was also awarded "Best PUA In the World" at the 2008 PUA Summit.   Media Attention Mystery and his seduction techniques have drawn the attention of the media on a number of occasions, including television appearances, magazine articles, and newspapers.
