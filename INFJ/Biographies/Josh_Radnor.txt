He is best known for portraying Ted Mosby on the popular Emmy Award-winning CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother. He made his writing and directorial debut with the 2010 comedy drama film Happythankyoumoreplease, for which he won the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. In 2012, he wrote, directed and starred in his second film, Liberal Arts, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival.[1]
Radnor was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Carol Radnor, a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer. Radnor has two sisters, Melanie Radnor and Joanna Radnor Vilensky. He grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a small city nested inside Columbus. Radnor attended Orthodox Jewish day schools (including the Columbus Torah Academy) and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[2][3][4] Radnor went to Bexley High School and later Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award and during which he spent a semester (Spring 1995) training at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, CT. He graduated from Kenyon with a B.A. in Drama in 1996.[5] Radnor received his Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University's Graduate Acting Program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.[5][6] Radnor participated in an Israel experience program in Tzfat with Livnot U'Lehibanot in 1997.[2]
In 2001, Radnor was cast as the lead in The WB series Off Centre. However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.[7] In 2002, he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of The Graduate, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. Since 2005, Radnor has starred in How I Met Your Mother, his biggest role to date. In July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play Finks,[8] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film Happythankyoumoreplease, in which he was also the writer and star.[9] His second film Liberal Arts, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[10]
Radnor dated actress Lindsay Price from 2008 to 2009. They met when shooting the How I Met Your Mother episode "Spoiler Alert".
In 2008 Radnor told the Los Angeles Times, "I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate."[11]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Josh Radnor was born on July 29, 1974 in Columbus, Ohio, USA as Joshua T. Radnor. He is an actor, known for How I Met Your Mother (2005), Liberal Arts (2012) and Not Another Teen Movie (2001).
      Made his Broadway debut in 2002 in the stage version of The Graduate (1967), starring opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone.
      Originally cast as the American lead in the pilot of the WB sitcom Off Centre (2001). The role was eventually played by Eddie Kaye Thomas.
      Graduated from Bexley High School, class of 1992, and came back as a guest speaker for the 2008 graduating class.
      Was Lindsay Price's boyfriend from August 2008 to late 2009. They first met when shooting How I Met Your Mother: Spoiler Alert (2007).
      His favorite films include The Breakfast Club (1985), Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004), Tootsie (1982), Das Leben der Anderen (2006) and Happiness (1998).
      He was an extra in the movie 200 Cigarettes (1999) where he appears for a few seconds at the entrance of a punk club (30th min 19th sec of the movie). He doesn't have a line.
      Everyone has expectations. You just don't want to have them dashed, so you're quiet about them.
      It really shocks me when I encounter people who think kindness doesn't matter. Because I think it's pretty much the only thing that matters.
      We're like a gardener with a hose and our attention is water - we can water flowers or we can water weeds.
      Cynicism is kind of like folding your arms and stepping back and commenting on things, like the old guys in 'The Muppets,' just throwing out comments all the time, whereas there are other people on the ground really trying to affect things and improve their lives and the lives of other people. I think it's noble and I think it's cool.
      It's not our job to play judge and jury, to determine who is worthy of our kindness and who is not. We just need to be kind, unconditionally and without ulterior motive, even - or rather, especially - when we'd prefer not to be.
      An obsessive attention to the news, I've realized, only serves to paint a picture of the world as a throbbing blob of dysfunction, most news falling somewhere on a scale from disappointing to calamitous.
      A movie can and should have some real dissonance throughout - rage, heartache, tears, conflict, catharsis and all the other elements Aristotle demanded of a good story - but the chord has to be resolved.
      Kindness is not about instant gratification. More often, it's akin to a low-risk investment that appreciates steadily over time.
      I distinguish sentiment from sentimentality. Sentimentality makes your skin crawl. It's like too much sugar. But, sentiment is a great feeling.
      All of the things I used to obsess over, I'm no longer as obsessed with. I have new concerns but they're a little more existential or cosmic.
      Acting on stage is still my favorite thing to do. And everyone who's been in musicals knows that there is nothing more fun.
      I haven't left the house without a packet of Kleenex in my back pocket for as long as I can remember. Whenever I start thinking I'm incredibly cool, the packet of Kleenex in my back pocket brings me right back down to earth.
      I kicked college nostalgia in my late 20s. As much as I loved college and treasure the memories, I no longer want to go back.
      I have really good female friends. I've never bought the whole men-and-women-can't-be-friends thing. I think that's sort of nonsense.
      I actually have a thing about proper nouns. They clang on my ear in a weird way when I hear them dropped into movies.
      Film allows me to ask some really big questions with the time to explore them deeply. I love the form.
      I went through this very serious Woody Allen phase in college and a little bit after college. I still see his movies.
      I tend to read things that are a little more on the nourishing side. But if I don't enjoy something, I'll put it down.
      No matter how dark things may get in a story, I feel it's the responsibility of the storyteller to leave the audience with at least a shred of hope.
      It never made sense to me that someone would achieve any kind of success in show business, only to become a jerk.
      There are just things you can explore in a movie that you can't in 22 minutes with a laugh track.
      The reflexive allergy to L.A. that a lot of New Yorkers have, I feel like it's kind of nonsense.
      A lot of times, we're just sold these movies that are really cynically conceived and marketed, and they just want you there opening weekend, before everybody finds out it's not so good.
      There's something melancholy about professors because they're chronically abandoned. They form these lovely relationships with students and then the students leave and the professors stay the same. It's like they're chronically abandoned.
      If I'm feeling something, I have a lot of different ways to express it, you know? I can write an article about it. I can write a screenplay about it. I can act in someone's thing.
      Here's the problem: I don't like who I've become when my iPhone is within reach. I find myself checking e-mails and responding to texts throughout the day with some kind of Pavlovian ferocity - it's not a conscious act, but a reflexive one.
      What I write is very personal, but not autobiographical. It's more 'thematically personal' - what's up in my life in terms of themes at the moment.
      I find myself going out less and less. When you're 22 and see older people start to do that, it's depressing, but once you hit 30, you think, 'Wow, I've been working all week - it might be really nice to stay in!'
      I don't think evil people or negative people are inherently interesting all the time. People who are good people getting better at being themselves - to me, that's something that's really interesting to watch.
      But, yeah, I'm really happy when I'm writing. When I'm being creative and when I have something that I can put down. You know, if you go out and you overhear a conversation or you have a thought, you have a receptacle to go home and say, 'Oh, this would be great in this script.' Your antenna's out in a different way, and I love that time.
      And as a filmmaker, I'm trying to unhook myself from this idea that unless you have a brilliant, long, enormously lucrative theatrical run, that your movie somehow failed. And I don't believe that.
      After a brief period in which I had let many a Southern Californian convince me that it was all 'in my mind,' I am once again officially allergic to dogs.
      I'm a little less hungry as an actor than I used to be. When you're a director, you're the conductor of the orchestra, and when you're an actor, you're playing the violin. There's a thrill to each of them, but as the conductor, you get the fuller sound.
      I'll say this, and this has nothing to do with gender or sexuality: You do not want to get licked in the face repeatedly by another human being. You just don't. It's not pleasant.
      I think the word 'earnest' kind of has a negative connotation on some level. I think one of the things that's happened is that being cynical is somehow conflated with being sophisticated. I think that's problematic, to say the least.
      I think that the mark of a great book is that it will meet you wherever you're at and you'll feel and experience something new and different each time you read it.
      I know not everyone starts out reading high literature. If you read enough you might be drawn to some other things, so maybe those vampire books are what they call 'gateway books.' I just coined that term. I don't know if there's a thing called 'gateway books.'
      Sometimes I watch the broad comedies coming out of Hollywood and I think, 'You know, sex is a big part of people's lives, but is that really the only thing men are ever concerned about?' People are more complicated than they appear in film or television.
      My whole thing is that I want to explore why you read books, what's the purpose of reading, and maybe that it's not that cool to hate something just because it's popular.
      It's strange to look back over a full season. Our characters have accrued all these memories, but so have we, the actors. And sometimes the character memories and the actor memories bleed into each other.
      I'm not sitting around saying, 'Man, I'd really love to direct a western.' That's just not something I'm probably going to do, mostly because I'm allergic to horses.
      I'm not a masochistic reader. If something is just too dense or not enjoyable, even though I'm told it should be good for me, I'll put it down. That said, most of what I read would be considered high-end or good for you, I suppose. But, I also think that reading should be enjoyable.
      When I write a film, there's a particular thing I am wrestling with and the question or concern I'm dealing with has to be big enough for me to dedicate a year or two of my life. If the question isn't big enough, or rich enough, I'll lose interest.
      When I go to movies and I love the movie, it's because it feels like it articulated something about how we're living now, and also gives me some insight into my own life. I feel actually altered after having seen it.
      Well, I stopped drinking. That was actually a big deal. I didn't go through any harrowing rock-bottom experience. I just made a decision to stop drinking.
      To write a story about New York that only deals with people in your age and socioeconomic bracket, that feels dishonest to me. So much of New York comes from everyone bumping into each other.
      There's so much nonsense tossed around about L.A. and how horrible it is and 'don't go out there' and all that stuff. So I went out to L.A. and I was pleasantly surprised.
      You know, I'm not saying, 'Oh, because I play a good guy on TV, I need to suddenly be villainous in a movie.' I look at it more like: does this role has a kind of urgency for me in terms of, 'Can I not say no to it for whatever reason?'

 This page or section uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia's Josh Radnor article. (view authors).
Radnor was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Carol Radnor, a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer. He has two sisters, Melanie Radnor and Joanna Radnor Vilensky. He grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a small city nested inside Columbus. He attended Orthodox Jewish day schools (including the Columbus Torah Academy) and was raised in Conservative Judaism. Radnor went to Bexley High School and later Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award, and he graduated with a B.A. in Drama. Radnor received his Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University's Graduate Acting Program at the Tisch School of the Arts. Radnor participated in an Israel experience program in Tzfat with Livnot U'Lehibanot in 1997.
In 2001, Radnor was cast as the lead in The WB series Off Centre. However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired. In 2002 he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of The Graduate, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. Since 2005, Radnor has starred in How I Met Your Mother, his biggest and best known role to date. In July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play Finks, written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film Happythankyoumoreplease, in which he was also the writer and star. His second film Liberal Arts, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.
Before the series began, Josh Radnor worked with Neil Patrick Harris in the world premiere of Jon Robin Baitz's play The Paris Letter.
Dated Lindsay Price from August 2008 to late 2009. They met while shooting for the season 3 episode Spoiler Alert in which Lindsay guest starred as Cathy, a love interest of Ted.

American actor Josh Radnor was born on July 29, 1974 in Bexley, Ohio. He started acting in school productions, and continued to do so during his tenure as a student of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where he was awarded the Paul Newman Acting Trophy by the school’s theater department. He eventually graduated with an MFA degree at the Tisch School of the Arts in New York City.Radnor started acting for the screen in 2000, when he made a guest appearance in the short-lived comedy Welcome to New York. The following year, he played the tour guide in the parody film Not Another Teen Movie. He was also originally attached to play a lead role in the WB sitcom Off Centre, a role which eventually went to Eddie Kaye Thomas. In 2002, Radnor made his Broadway debut, appearing in the stage version of the film The Graduate. He continued playing guest roles on television, appearing in shows such as Law & Order, ER, Six Feet Under, Miss Match and Judging Amy.After a stint in the short-lived legal drama The Court, Radnor was cast in his most successful role yet: as the lead Ted Mosby in the CBS comedy How I Met Your Mother. The series revolves around his character, telling his son and daughter about the events that led to him meeting their mother. His character tries to find his soulmate, despite being prone to many socially questionable romantic gestures, sometimes spectacularly failing in wooing the girl he loves—stealing a French horn, wearing skimpy costumes on Halloween, among others. He also voiced an animated version of this character in the series Family Guy, along with his How I Met Your Mother co-star Neil Patrick Harris.

"I think the show is incredibly romantic and not just about romance. You know, Marshall [Jason Segel] and Lily [Alyson Hannigan] go through stuff, but ultimately, that's an iron clad bond they have. It's romantic about the city, it's romantic about friendship, it's romantic about a certain time in your life. It's self-aware enough to know that people are cynical and that's a kind of mode a lot of people of our generation, but it's over-arching M.O. is sincerity and nostalgia. It's kind of interested in subverting a lot of assumptions of what people that age are supposed to be like; in that way it's more honest of what people are like." - Interview with Starpulse

In the hiatus before the Season 2 of his series How I Met Your Mother began, Josh went to  Jason Segel's house in Hawaii on the North Shore for a week. Alyson Hannigan and husband, Alexis Denisof also went to visit Jason, and then Cobie Smulders came when Josh was there. Then he went to Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California. And last he went to his 10-year college reunion, in Kenyon, Ohio. 
Josh appeared Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club and the Blue Light Theater Company. 
Josh made his Broadway debut in 2002 in the stage version of The Graduate (1967) starring opposite Kathleen Turner.
Josh's parents wanted him to receive a liberal arts degree but he ended up being a drama major. Later Josh went to NYU to get an M.F.A in acting.
Josh, on his character Ted from How I Met Your Mother : I like his optimism. He's very romantic, sometimes bordering on clinical insanity, but he really wants to meet the right girl. He doesn't really hide anything, which is nice.
Josh originally played the lead role in the WB sitcom Off Centre. However, he was replaced by Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.
Josh (about what he did during the WGA Strike): I moved out of my $800 a month sublet. It was actually traumatic. I was, like, 'I don't want to leave this place.' But I bought a beautiful place. So I moved. I had all this time to move in. And I traveled a bit. I did some writing. I kept pretty busy.
Josh (about Britney Spears working on How I Met Your Mother): She was on time, she knew her lines. She's going to be really funny. I mean, I have nothing scandalous to offer.
Josh (Talks about what he hope to accomplish over the course of his career): I used to think a lot about that and oddly I think about that less and less. I just want to keep doing what I feel called to do," he responds. "I'd like to write a novel one day. I don't want to ever stray too far from the theater. It's where I came from and it's really the thing I feel like I do best. When I moved out to LA, I made a bargain with myself that I would do a play a year so I could hold on to my soul. I've stayed on that schedule so far.
Josh (Talks about the structure and concepts of How I Met Your Mother): I think it tries to balance the funny, traditional sitcom moments with more sincere, romantic moments that aren't really seen in sitcoms. The guys who created our show don't seem to be influenced by other sitcoms as much as they are the world of film. The shows really going for something that hasn't been seen. A traditional sitcom will have five or six scenes in a 22 minutes episode - we have like 40 to 60 scenes. Also, we don't shoot in front of a live audience, which is rare. It's a lot more like doing a one hour. But I think it's good we don't do it in front of an audience. I think it keeps us playing to each other and keeps us honest.
Josh (Talks about his family and his beginning on acting): There are no actors in my family or even in my town. I just started acting in high school and it immediately felt like something I never wanted to stop doing. I got bit by the bug. It's the classic tale. They were, but in a very measured way at first. They didn't want me to go to an acting conservatory. They wanted me to get a liberal arts degree in college, which I did, but I ended up being a drama major. Right after college I went to NYU to get my M.F.A. in acting. Then I just started working right after that.
Josh (Talks about the fact that he   doesn't get CBS on his only TV and he doesn't watch any TV): I'm worried I won't read any books, though sometimes, I think I should watch just to give my brain a rest. 
Josh (Talks about what people don't know about one of his cast mates): That Jason Segel, who plays Marshall, is a great singer-songwriter. That's pretty cool, right? There's an episode where he sang half his dialogue and that was all his stuff. We still sing those songs, because they were actually pretty catchy.
Josh (Talks about what people be surprise to know about him): That he doesn't have cable, and the TV he does have in his bedroom doesn't get CBS. (Talking about himself in third person)
Josh (Reflects on why his series How I Met Your Mother has succeeded and has been able to hold onto it): I dunno, maybe because they promoted the hell out of it? (Laughs) No, I think it's because it's about young people but it doesn't sound like it was written by 55-year-olds. Thirty-year-old guys created the show, so it feels pretty authentic. And it's not one of those shows that's ironic or cynical we have that element, where its sincerity is tempered by the Barney character, Neil Patrick Harris but for the most part this show wears its heart on its sleeve in a really nice way, not an overly sentimental one. These are characters who really care about something, versus making "joke-joke-joke-joke."
Josh (Talking about 'The One'): While I think I am a pretty nice guy, I have never personally used the term 'The One.' Whenever someone uses that term, I cringe a little. My view of romance is a little more complex than that. I have never been the guy who says, 'Hey let's have a big relationship.' I tend to tiptoe into them and then I realize, 'Wait, this is pretty great. This is nothing to be scared of.' 
Josh (Talks about the themes of How I Met your Mother): It's a great gender reversal, (Radnor says) because the guys are sensitive and ready to commit while the girls are tough, especially Robin. She's ostensibly not looking for a relationship, but she might be turning the corner.
Josh (Jokes about How I met your mother): I don't know if they want me to say it's an accountant from New Jersey that I meet in season five, or it's Keira Knightley... 
				This is the best show on tv and I wish I had ted in real life! Ted is fuc#$%$ hot and sweet and the best guy ever wish I could meet him!
				I honestly see this guy as a boring sort of actor. He gets the job done but there's something about his performance which seems lacking. I kind of view him as the "Ross Geller" from friends in this program. Not that I can do better, just giving my opinion.

Biography:Born July 29, 1974 in Columbus, OH, Radnor developed an interest in acting purely by accident; after tagging along with friends to a high school theater audition, he decided that he could handle a role better than any of the other hopefuls, and tried out for the part himself.

Josh Radnor, star of the CBS series How I Met Your Mother and writer, director, and star of the Sundance Audience Award-winning movie happythankyoumoreplease (due out in theaters late summer) was the latest celebrity to take our Sabbath Manifesto "Unplug Challenge," connecting to life without technology for 24 hours last weekend.
"The sun went down.  The sun came up.  The sun went down again.  In that time, I abstained from the following: phone, television, computer, internet, email, texting, and music.  I was told I could set my own parameters, so I had to decide for myself if going to see "Hot Tub Time Machine" Friday night constituted a violation of the terms.  If any movie in current release felt appropriate to see, I reasoned, it would have to be this one - a bunch of dudes zapping themselves back to 1986.  Wasn't I kind of doing my own version of that?
Even though I occasionally appear on it, I don't watch television.  Partly this is because I'm snobby and always worried I'm not reading enough books.  Partly this is because whenever I watch television for longer than ten minutes I find myself getting depressed.  But mostly it's because I have an impossibly complicated, possibly mis-wired AV system thing going on at my house and I literally cannot figure out how to turn on the stupid television.  I feel like I'm 103 years old.  So no television = no big deal. 
This was a big one for me.  I listen to a lot of music.  I'd agreed to do a weeklong workshop of a new play at the South Coast Repertory Theater, so I had an hour-long drive down to Costa Mesa Saturday morning.  With no music in the car, I did the next best thing: I sang.  Like the titular hot tub time machine, I found myself zapping back to my past, unearthing long forgotten melodies I learned in the Reagan era.  The first song that popped into my head was the summer camp classic, "The Other Day I Met A Bear." ("A great big bear, oh way up there..."  Anyone, anyone?)  I made it through a few verses and got bored.  Next (and I have no idea where these were coming from), I hit the great Gershwin tune, "Our Love Is Here To Stay," and was shocked to hear myself - on this day of all days - arrive at the following lyric:
The song was written in 1938 (just Googled it, natch) and I find it amusing that even then, Ira Gershwin noted that all that newfangled technology could be a thorn in our collective side.  
Time off from the news is always something I welcome.  Anyone who goes on a news fast reports an almost immediate uptick in happiness and a decrease in anxiety.  I've noted this in myself, yet still I tend to saturate my nervous system with online news.  I can't tell if this is the result of some kind of masochism or an unshakable feeling that staying "informed" is my duty as a citizen.  Or maybe I've convinced myself one needs a certain amount of ammo to participate in the cultural conversation.  But more than occasionally I wonder if that's the conversation I want to be having. 
I worry, of course, that my impulse to pay less attention to the news will turn me into either an ascetic weirdo or a new-age fruitcake allergic to any and all "negativity."  But that's not what this is about for me.  An obsessive attention to the news, I've realized, only serves to paint a picture of the world as a throbbing blob of dysfunction, most news falling somewhere on a scale from disappointing to calamitous.  What we call "the news" is really "the bad news."  There's endless amounts of good news going unreported.  I know that sounds hopelessly naïve, but my chronic, obsessive attention to online news doesn't make my life better - it makes me less engaged, more afraid, more convinced we're heading off the cliff and that maybe it's best to just huddle close with those most like me.  And this is the very opposite of how I wish to feel.  So 24 hours away from the headlines = fantastic.
Here's the problem: I don't like who I've become when my iPhone is within reach.  I find myself checking e-mails and responding to texts throughout the day with some kind of Pavlovian ferocity - it's not a conscious act, but a reflexive one. I'm not the first to point out that great modern paradox: the more "connected" we get, the fewer true connections we seem to be making.  When my eyes and fingers are locked on the iPhone, yes, I'm connecting to people in my life, albeit connection of the electronic variety.  But I'm intensely disconnected from whatever's actually happening around me in that moment.  
Whatever the case, I prefer 2010 to 1986.  I've never cast my lot with the "things-were-better-way-back-when" crowd.  If I favor integration over reversion - and that seems the only real option - the question is: how does one navigate a life in this wired world without turning into a robot?  Technological advancements are always morally neutral and like with all things, there's an upside and a downside.  The trick, it seems to me, is to find a way to not go unconscious - to be, as they say, in the world, but not of it.
I'm still working out exactly how to do that, but some ritualized unplugging seems a good place to start.  It really was a very nice 24 hours - I saw some friends, I sang in my car with the windows down, I rehearsed a wonderful play with some talented folks, I saw my niece and nephew and had a really nice dinner with my sister.  Nothing flashy.  But it felt real, slower.  I could almost hear myself breathing.  I'm pretty sure I was alive."
The "Unplug Challenge," is sponsored by Reboot, a non-profit organization that aims to reinvent the cultures, traditions and rituals of Jewish life for a broad audience.
The Sabbath Manifesto "Unplug Challenge" builds on the success of Reboot's National Day of Unplugging March 20, 2010, when people were asked to shut off their cell phones and computers for 24 hours. Radnor is a member of the Reboot network.
Reboot's Sabbath Manifesto is a new project that is encouraging young, hyper-connected, and frequently frantic people of all denominations to re-embrace the ancient beauty of a day of rest.
Post your stories of what it was like for you to unplug for 24 hours on our Sabbath Manifesto site. Every month, we will choose a testimonial from those posted and pair it with the "Unplug Challenge" column on the Huffington Post.
This month, we are highlighting an unplugging testimonial from Aaron Bryant, 40, of Austin, Texas, who founded ECM Mentors, a document and records management consulting company.
Bryant said that he doesn't normally comment on websites but that he felt compelled after seeing a story about the Sabbath Manifesto on CNN. He said that unplugging has made a big difference in his life and in his relationships with his wife, Paula, and their 13-year-old son Aaron Jr.
"It is something I do all the time now," he said. "Every Thursday my wife and I have a date night and we unplug. We get away and we eat and talk. We have no TV, no phones, nothing."
On our website, he wrote: "I'm not Jewish, actually I'm Muslim but I felt compelled to share my story with you. A few months ago I was feeling overwhelmed with all the "connectivity" that I was practicing that I made a decision to unplug. I canceled my Facebook page, stopped twittering totally, and really just tried to minimize my online life. I found this article interesting because today I am taking my son on a camping trip for the weekend. I'm going to introduce him to the great outdoors and re-connect with him. I truly appreciate what you are doing and I totally support it."
Ben Greenman was the most recent person to take our Sabbath Manifesto "Unplug Challenge," cutting off his cell phone and computer for 24 hours last weekend.
