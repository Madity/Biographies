Phillip Calvin "Phil" McGraw (born September 1, 1950), known as Dr. Phil, is an American television personality, author, psychologist, and the host of the television show Dr. Phil, which debuted in 2002. McGraw first gained celebrity status with appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the late 1990s.[3]
McGraw was born in Vinita, Oklahoma, the son of Anne Geraldine "Jerry" (née Stevens) and Joseph J. "Joe" McGraw, Jr.[4][5] He grew up with two older sisters, Deana and Donna, and younger sister Brenda[6] in the oilfields of North Texas where his father was an equipment supplier. During McGraw's childhood, his family moved so his father could pursue and obtain a lifelong goal of becoming a psychologist.
McGraw attended Shawnee Mission North High School in Overland Park, Kansas. In 1968, he was awarded a football scholarship to the University of Tulsa, where he played middle linebacker under Coach Glenn Dobbs. On November 23 of that year, McGraw's team lost to the University of Houston 100–6, which is one of the most lopsided games in college football history.[7] Coach Dobbs retired after that season and McGraw transferred to Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas.
McGraw graduated in 1975 from Midwestern State University with a B.A. degree in psychology. He went on to earn a M.A. degree in experimental psychology in 1976, and a Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology in 1979 at the University of North Texas,[8] where his dissertation was titled "Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Psychological Intervention".[9] McGraw was guided through the doctoral program by Frank Lawlis, who later became the primary contributing psychologist for the Dr. Phil television show.[10][dead link]
After obtaining his doctorate, McGraw joined his father, Joe McGraw, in Wichita Falls, Texas, where the elder McGraw had established his private psychology practice.[11]
In 1983, McGraw and his father joined Thelma Box, a successful Texas businesswoman, in presenting "Pathways" seminars, "experience-based training which allows individuals to achieve and create their own results."[12][dead link] Critics claim that many of the "phrases and the terminology and the quaint sayings" used by McGraw on the Oprah and Dr. Phil shows were coined by Box and presented by McGraw in this seminar. McGraw admits that some of the material from Life Strategies, his first best-seller, is taken directly from the Pathways seminar. However, he has never mentioned Box or her contributions to his success in any of his books or TV shows.[13] Eight years after joining Box, McGraw signed an agreement for the sale of his Pathways seminar stock for $325,000 without notifying either his father or Box of the impending sale.[13] Box founded her own seminars entitled "Choices."[14][dead link]
On October 21, 1988, the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists determined that McGraw had hired a former patient for "part-time temporary employment".[15] Specifically, the board cited "a possible failure to provide proper separation between termination of therapy and the initiation of employment,"[16] issued a letter of reprimand and imposed administrative penalties.[17] The board also investigated claims made by the patient of inappropriate contact initiated by McGraw, but the "Findings of Fact" document issued by the board on October 21, 1988, at the end of its investigation includes no reference to any physical contact of any kind. It specifically identified "the therapeutic and business relationships" as constituting McGraw's sole issue with the board.[17] McGraw fulfilled all terms of the board's requirements, and the board closed its complaint file in June 1990.[18]
In 1990, McGraw joined lawyer Gary Dobbs in co-founding Courtroom Sciences, Inc. (CSI), a trial consulting firm through which McGraw later came into contact with Oprah Winfrey.[19] Eventually, CSI became a profitable enterprise, advising Fortune 500 companies and injured plaintiffs in achieving settlements. McGraw is no longer an officer or director of the company.[19]
After starting CSI, McGraw ceased the practice of psychology. He kept his license current and in good standing until he elected to retire it 15 years later in 2006.[20] Appearing on the Today Show in January 2008, McGraw said that he has made it "very clear" that his current work does not involve the practice of psychology. He also said that he had "retired from psychology".[21] According to the Today Show, the California Board of Psychology determined in 2002 that he did not require a license because his show involves "entertainment" rather than psychology.[21] McGraw's license is currently listed by the Texas State Board of Psychology as "retired" and he holds no other active licenses to practice in any other state.[22]
In 1995, Oprah Winfrey hired McGraw's legal consulting firm CSI to prepare her for the Amarillo Texas beef trial. Winfrey was so impressed with McGraw that she thanked him for her victory in that case, which ended in 1998. Soon after, she invited him to appear on her show. His appearance proved so successful that he began appearing weekly as a relationship and life strategy expert on Tuesdays starting in April 1998.
The next year, McGraw published his first best-selling book, Life Strategies.[13] In the next four years, McGraw published three additional best-selling relationship books, along with workbooks to complement them.
As of September 2002, McGraw formed Peteski Productions[23] and launched his own syndicated daily television show, Dr. Phil, produced by Winfrey's Harpo Studios. The format is an advice show, where he tackles a different topic on each show, offering advice for his guests' troubles.
In 2003, McGraw entered the weight-loss business, selling shakes, energy bars, and supplements. These products were promoted on his show with his sisters Deana and Brenda and nephew Tony among the featured testimonials on the show.[24] These products' labels, which carried the brand name "Shape It Up, Woo, Woo!", stated: "These products contain scientifically researched levels of ingredients that can help you change your behavior to take control of your weight." This met with swift criticism from various sources,[3] accusing McGraw (a clinical psychologist, and not a physician) of lacking the expertise to recommend weight-loss products. Facing a Federal Trade Commission investigation into Shape Up's claims, McGraw pulled his supplements off the market in March 2004, and the FTC dropped its probe. In October 2005, several people who used McGraw's products declared an intent to file a class-action lawsuit against him, claiming that although the supplements cost $120 per month they did not stimulate weight loss.[25][dead link] McGraw settled the suit in September 2006 for $10.5 million.[26] Some of the settlement ($6 million) may be paid to the plaintiffs in the form of Amway (Quixtar) brand Nutrilite vitamins.[27][dead link]
The Making of Dr. Phil is a biography by Sophia Dembling, a reporter from the Dallas Morning News, and Lisa Gutierrez, a reporter from The Kansas City Star.[4] The book probes McGraw's history, with interviews of his childhood friends and former classmates. The book reports that McGraw allegedly used unethical business practices in a gym business early in his career, that he was allegedly abusive to his first wife and to his staff, while noting that he overcame adversity through setting goals and was persistent in achieving success. The book received no promotional help from McGraw or his associates.[28]
In 2005, McGraw published another best-selling book, Family First, along with a workbook. He also signed a five-year extension of his syndication deal with his show's distributors, King World Productions, Inc. The deal will pay McGraw $15 million a year[29] and keep the show in production through the 2013–2014 television season.[30][dead link]
Also in 2005, McGraw's son Jay's television show Renovate My Family (a clone of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition) was canceled at the start of its second season following a renovated family's lawsuit.[31][32] Jay McGraw and Phil McGraw then formed Stage 29 Productions.[33] A week later, McGraw and son announced a new show called Moochers (a clone of ABC's Kicked Out);[34][dead link] however, the show was canceled before any episodes aired. McGraw also released another book, Love Smart, which did not achieve the success of his previous bestsellers.
In 2006, the Dr. Phil House (a clone of CBS's Big Brother) began airing as part of the Dr. Phil television show. Following a protest by neighbors, the house in Los Angeles was shut down, and production resumed on a sound stage on a studio back lot.[35] McGraw reached the number 22 spot on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, with income of $45 million.[36]
Another Stage 29 show, Decision House (a remix of the Dr. Phil House) aired from September through November 2007 but was canceled due to poor reviews and dismal ratings.[37] Ratings for the Dr. Phil show in 2007 began to slide. In May, viewership was close to 7 million people.[38] However, by year's end, viewership was about 5.5 million people (#10 for syndicated TV shows, and just under Everybody Loves Raymond, Family Guy and CSI: Miami).[39] By August 2008, viewership slipped to just over 4 million people.[40] Two weeks later, the show slipped beneath the Nielsen top 12 syndicated TV shows, and has since resurfaced.[41] McGraw's income fell by 1/3 to $30 million, and he dropped to the number 30 spot on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list.[42]
Late in 2007, McGraw began promoting his 2008 Dr. Phil Show extension, The Doctors.[43][dead link] The show is hosted by television personality and ER physician Travis Stork (The Bachelor). Other experts scheduled to appear include various personalities who have appeared on the Dr. Phil show over the years, such as Lisa Masterson, an obstetrician/gynecologist; Andrew Ordon, a plastic surgeon; and Jim Sears, a pediatrician.[44] Masterson, Ordon, and Sears appeared on the Dr. Phil show during the 2007–08 season so that McGraw could instruct them on "how to give articulate medical advice while being scrutinized by a studio audience in Los Angeles."[citation needed] McGraw's eldest son, Jay McGraw, is executive producer of the show. The Doctors debuted on September 8, 2008, and, as of November 10, 2008, had a 2.0 rating.[45]
McGraw was named a co-defendant, along with CBS Television, in a 2006 lawsuit filed in relation to the disappearance of Natalee Holloway.[46] The lawsuit was filed by Deepak Kalpoe and his brother Satish Kalpoe, who claimed that an interview they did with McGraw, aired in September 2005, was "manipulated and later broadcast as being accurate, and which portrays Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe 'as engaging in criminal activity against Natalee Holloway and constitutes defamation.'"[46] The Kalpoe brothers claimed invasion of privacy, fraud, deceit, defamation, emotional distress, and civil conspiracy in the suit, which was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court.[47][dead link][48]
In January 2008, McGraw visited entertainer Britney Spears in her hospital room.[49] The visit by McGraw drew criticism from the Spears family and from mental health professionals.
The visit appeared to be part of an attempt at getting Spears and her parents to take part in an "intervention" on the Dr. Phil television show.[50] Immediately after the visit, McGraw issued public statements[51][52][dead link] about Spears' situation that Spears' family spokeswoman Lou Taylor said violated their family trust in McGraw. "This is another example of a trust being betrayed", Taylor told Today co-host Meredith Vieira. "Rather than helping the family’s situation, the celebrity psychologist caused additional damage", she said.[53] Several mental health care professionals criticized McGraw for his actions; however, fellow TV psychologist Joyce Brothers defended McGraw.[54][dead link] It was reported that a psychologist filed a complaint with the California Board of Psychology (BOP), alleging that McGraw had practiced psychology without a license and had violated doctor-patient privilege by discussing Spears' case with the media.[55] A copy of the complaint appeared in the media,[55] but there is no way to verify whether or not it was actually submitted to the BOP. The BOP does not disclose that information unless an investigation is opened.[56] Martin Greenberg, a former BOP President, said on the Today Show that this incident was not a matter that the law covers or would be concerned about.[56]
On April 13, 2008, a producer for the Dr. Phil show secured $30,000 bail for the ringleader of a group of eight teenage girls who viciously beat another girl and videotaped the attack.[57] The teen had been booked at the Polk County, Florida, jail on charges that included kidnapping and assault. Producers of the Dr. Phil show had made plans to tape a one-hour show devoted to the incident and had sent a production assistant to Orlando to help book guests for the show. However, when news broke that the Dr. Phil show producer had posted bail for the teen, the outcry caused the show to cancel their plans. "In this case certain staffers went beyond our guidelines," said Theresa Corigliano, spokesperson for the Dr. Phil show. "We have decided not to go forward with the story as our guidelines have been compromised."[58][dead link]
McGraw was sued by Thomas Riccio, the memorabilia collector responsible for taping the Las Vegas robbery that led to OJ Simpson's being convicted. Riccio sued McGraw in Los Angeles Superior Court for defamation, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false light for what Riccio claims to have been deceitful editing of the Dr. Phil Show on which he appeared in early October 2008.[59][dead link]
McGraw's advice and methods have drawn criticism from some fellow psychotherapists as well as from some laymen. McGraw's critics regard advice given by him to be at best simplistic, and at worst, ineffective.[60] McGraw said in a 2001 South Florida newspaper interview that he never liked traditional one-on-one counseling, and that "I'm not the Hush-Puppies, pipe and 'Let's talk about your mother' kind of psychologist."[61]
McGraw announced the formation of the Dr. Phil Foundation, which raises funds to fight childhood obesity, on October 22, 2003. The Foundation also supports charitable organizations that help address the emotional, spiritual and monetary needs of many children and families.[62]
McGraw married his first wife, an ex-cheerleader and homecoming queen named Debbie Higgins McCall, in 1970, when he was 20 years old.[11] According to her, McGraw was domineering and would not allow her to participate in the family business. She claimed that she was confined to domestic duties, which included lifting weights to improve her bustline.[63]
During the process of annulling the marriage in 1973, McGraw began dating Robin Jo Jameson (born December 28, 1953).[64] The couple had two children, Jay, born in 1979, and Jordan, born 1986.[65]
McGraw's son, Jay McGraw, has partially followed in his father's footsteps, publishing books aimed at teenagers based on McGraw's books and working for Stage 29. Jay McGraw became engaged to Erica Dahm, one of the famous Playboy Playmate triplets.[66] The elder McGraw, who has been an outspoken critic of pornography, was best man at his son's wedding, which was held at his home in Beverly Hills.[10]
According to Suzanne Bruring, who worked for Texas Monthly editor Skip Hollandsworth as a transcriptionist from 1998 to 2003, Hollandsworth provided "verbiage as (ghost) author for a Dr. Phil book".[68]

Dr. Phil McGraw, perhaps the most well-known mental health professional in the world, is the host of the new leader in daytime talk, Dr. Phil. Launched in 2002, Dr. Phil provides the most comprehensive forum on mental health issues in the history of television.  For 11 years, Dr. McGraw has used the Dr. Phil platform to make psychology accessible and understandable to the general public by addressing important personal and social issues. Using his top-rated show as a teaching tool, he takes aim at the critical issues of our time, including the “silent epidemics” of bullying, drug abuse, domestic violence, depression, child abuse, suicide and various forms of severe mental illness.Dr. McGraw uses the power of television to tell compelling stories about real people with a wide range of emotional and behavioral problems, stripping away the shame and embarrassment that often keeps people from seeking help. Many viewers, for the first time in their lives, develop an understanding of problems experienced by their families and themselves and, in the comfort of their homes, experience the hope and possibility of change. With a strong commitment to research and the assistance of leading scholars and behavioral scientists, Dr. McGraw educates viewers about state-of-the-art and evidence-based treatment options for many of the most challenging problems faced by individuals, couples and families. His unique dedication to families and children is legend to the millions of people around the world who watch his show and read his books.Dr. McGraw’s work was recognized by the American Psychological Association in 2006, by honoring him with a presidential citation.   Over the years, the Dr. Phil show has received 25 Emmy nominations and won five PRISM Awards, for the accurate depiction of drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse and addiction.  In addition, The Alliance for Women in Media, sponsors of the Gracie Award, named after Gracie Allen, has honored Dr. Phil four times.  In addition to creating more than 1,800 hours of national television devoted to helping people create better lives and families,  Dr. McGraw is  the author of seven #1 New York Times bestsellers,  published in 39 languages with more than 25 million copies in print. Because of his broad education, training and experience in the field of psychology, and his unique ability to effectively communicate in common sense language,  Dr. McGraw is  frequently called upon for his expert opinion on current events by major national and international news outlets, including the Today show, Good Morning America, The Early Show and Anderson Cooper 360.In 2003, Dr. McGraw established The Dr. Phil Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization, funding many worthy projects benefiting disadvantaged children and families. In addition to his work with the Dr. Phil Foundation, Dr. McGraw is a frequent supporter of many worthwhile organizations, including the Court Appointed Special Advocates program. Dr. McGraw and his wife, Robin, have devoted countless hours promoting their recruitment project generating an increase of 100 million dollars of volunteer services in just one year.  Additionally, he frequently supports disaster relief and was quick to volunteer in post-Katrina New Orleans and in earthquake-ravaged Haiti.  The Dr. Phil Foundation is another tool in McGraw’s arsenal to fight problems that cripple our society in subtle but undeniable ways.Dr. McGraw earned a B.A. from Midwestern State University and an M.A. and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of North Texas, which was followed by a year of postdoctoral training in Forensic Psychology at The Wilmington Institute.   Dr. McGraw was a licensed psychologist in the State of Texas and practiced clinical psychology, where he developed a multimodal treatment protocol for chronic pain patients. With his training and interest in forensic psychology, Dr. McGraw founded CSI (Courtroom Sciences, Inc.), a consulting firm specializing in litigation strategies performing a wide variety of forensic activities.  After 25 years, he retired from practice as a licensed psychologist to devote full time to his educational media platform. An avid tennis player, golfer and scuba diver, Dr. McGraw lives in Los Angeles with his wife Robin. The couple, married for 37 years, is totally devoted to their family, which includes sons Jay and Jordan, and Jay’s wife Erica.  Jay and Erica welcomed their second child in August 2011, London Phillip, who is Dr. Phil and Robin’s first grandson.  Big sister Avery Elizabeth was born in March 2010.

Big Family, Big Problems?Today's Show: "Give Me Back My Child!" 
          Robin McGraw, wife of best-selling author and television talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw, has made "family first" her mission. Married for 37 years to Dr. Phil, whom she fondly refers to as "Phillip," Robin has made her marriage and raising their two sons Jay, 33, and Jordan, 26, her priority in life. 
A constant presence on the Dr. Phil show since the very first episode, viewers worldwide have embraced Robin's contributions to the show, whether it be discussing her experiences as a mother and wife, or dealing with issues that women face in the many phases of their lives. She has been a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show and Rachael Ray and hosted White House Christmas 2006 on HGTV. In addition, Robin has co-hosted many television events with Dr. Phil, including Christmas in Washington, the JC Penney Jam Concert for America's Kids and the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular. The couple has also been featured on such shows as Larry King Live, The View, The Academy of Country Music Awards, The Early Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Insider, Late Show with David Letterman, and the Hour of Power with Dr. Robert S. Schuller. 
Robin is also a sought-after author within the publishing world. In September 2006, Nelson Books, a division of Thomas Nelson Publishers, released her debut book entitled Inside My Heart: Choosing to Live with Passion and Purpose. In Inside My Heart, Robin shares the philosophies and life choices that have proven to align her with God's will. Robin also advises women how to recognize and develop their unique role for greater satisfaction with themselves, their profession, their family life and anything they strive for “and to simply be the best they can be.”  In January of 2009, Robin released another best-seller, What's Age Got to Do With It?, which shares all her secrets to success — along with some mishaps — in the areas of fitness, nutrition, skincare, menopause, hair, makeup and fashion. Robin's latest book, Christmas in My Home and Heart, Robin McGraw conveys her favorite aspects of the holiday season. 
Robin is a board member of The Dr. Phil Foundation, a non-profit charitable organization committed to supporting organizations and programs that address the emotional, physical, mental and spiritual needs of children and families. In 2007, she was recognized with the Heart of Gold    Award by the Starlight Starbright Foundation for her longtime dedication to child welfare and devotion to her family. She and Dr. Phil were also recognized in 2007 with the Big Heart Award by the Westside Children's Center for their outstanding work with at-risk children and their families. Currently, Robin is a national spokesperson for CASA along with Dr. Phil. In 2010, Robin became a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta Fraternity, which has donated more than $1 million to CASA over the last 20 years. 
In March of 2010, Robin and Dr. Phil became grandparents for the first time, when their son Jay and his wife, Erica, welcomed their daughter, Avery Elizabeth. In August 2011, Erica gave birth to a son, London Phillip.

                Phil McGraw was the straight-talking Texan whose advice won Oprah her lawsuit against angry beef farmers. He is the former college linebacker who became a hit TV psychologist. It seems everybody knows who Dr Phil is. The plain-spoken Texan became an instant celebrity, seemingly out of nowhere, when Oprah Winfrey nicknamed him "Tell It Like It Is Phil" and made him a regular on her show. Since 1998, his brutal honesty has shaken up hundreds of lives, and it regularly spikes the show's ratings. From that platform, he wrote three self-help books that topped the bestseller lists. Fans will get a daily dose of Dr Phil's tough medicine this fall, when his syndicated show debuts. But who is the man behind the TV persona? What did he do before he became a national phenomenon? What landed McGraw in psychology was the example set by his father Joe, who returned to school to study psychology at 40. He inherited his father's fierce independence and restless nature. As a 6-foot-4 inch, 174-pound high school linebacker in Kansas City, KS, he won a football scholarship to the University of Tulsa. But his playing days ended in his sophomore year, after he injured his head and neck on the field. Later, he returned to school to study psychology at the University of North Texas, picking up his master's and Ph.D. in just four years. When he wasn't hitting the books, he courted and married Robin, now his wife of 25 years. After he graduated, McGraw went into practice with his father in Wichita Falls, Texas. Very soon, he realised that his heart wasn't in one-on-one therapy, and he began to search for non-traditional ways to use his psychological training. The result was a series of successful businesses; one of them, a popular self-motivation seminar called Pathways, revealed Phil's charisma and ability to work with large groups. Later, he built a successful legal strategy business. That company, called Courtroom Sciences, Inc., helped high-profile trial lawyers to build airtight cases using psychology. Phil discovered he preferred the orderliness and instant results of courtroom work, while the adversarial nature of trial work got his competitive juices flowing. By the time he met Oprah Winfrey, he was already a financially successful and happily married father of two boys. But that encounter changed his life. It happened during the talk show host's big beef trial. A group of Texas cattlemen claimed that when Winfrey swore off hamburgers during an April 1996 show on mad cow disease, she cost them a large chunk of their livelihoods. And they wanted millions in damages. Oprah's attorneys contacted McGraw to help plot a way for Winfrey to beat the cattlemen on their own turf. Phil found Oprah in an uncharacteristic state of despair, but his coaching helped her win what looked like an impossible case, and she made him a star. His weekly appearances on Oprah, 'Tuesdays with Dr Phil', allowed him to do what he couldn't do in private practice. He won fans telling crybabies and wallowers to "get real." Tearful guests received common sense advice, delivered in a down-home Texan drawl, not self-help jargon. And with his tough demeanor, he became a relationship guru that men felt comfortable listening to. It all translated into instant popularity and a new self-help empire, as Dr Phil generated three New York Times bestsellers in as many years. First came 'Life Strategies' in 1999, then 'Relationship Rescue' in 2000, and finally 'Self Matters' in 2001. But perhaps the truest measure of his success is that he was spoofed on 'Saturday Night Live'. Phil has recently moved from Dallas to Los Angeles to launch his new syndicated show, 'Dr Phil', the most eagerly anticipated new show of the season.

On November 23rd of that year, this team was defeated by the University of Houston, 100-6, in one of the most lopsided college games in history. Scoring a touchdown for Houston, in this game, was wide receiver Larry Gatlin of Larry Gatlin & The Gatlin Brothers fame.
      We all have a social mask, right? We put it on, we go out, put our best foot forward, our best image. But behind that social mask is a personal truth, what we really, really believe about who we are and what we're capable of.
      The Internet is just bringing all kinds of information into the home. There's just a lot of distraction, a lot of competition for the parent's voice to resonate in the children's ears.
      There's a big difference between falling in love and being in love. There's a big difference between infatuation and falling in love.
      At the end of the day, whether or not those people are comfortable with how you're living your life doesn't matter. What matters is whether you're comfortable with it.
      I'm embarrassed every time I look a teacher in the eye, because we ask them to do so much for so little.
      My dad used to say, 'You wouldn't worry so much about what people thought about you if you knew how seldom they did.
      Eighty percent of all choices are based on fear. Most people don't choose what they want; they choose what they think is safe.
      If your neighbor has a completely different view on abortion, gay marriage, stem cell research, all of those things, you still are both Americans. Neither one of you is necessarily more patriotic than the other. Neither loves their country any more than the other one does.
      You have got to decide, look, this is who I am; this is my best way to present myself, and I'm going to ride that horse to the finish line. Not everybody will like it, but that's OK.
      There is nothing wrong with your marriage if you're dealing with bills and kids and the broken garbage disposal and in-laws and work demands. That's a normal marriage.
      You know, what we do know is that there is a high frequency of violence in the home of those who bully.
      I mean, if you degrade someone, you isolate them, you control them, you call them names, you demean them. That's a horrible existence for people.
      The truth is, I think we are a self-less society, not a selfish society. Because we're so busy now.
      Relationships are negotiated and if you deal with ultimatums and authority all the time, then you're not going to get anywhere.
      Oh, everybody wears a mask. We all put our best foot forward. We all try and make a statement, I'm not saying that's bad.
      I don't care how pumped up or psyched you are to start a new diet or a new program - that emotion will fade.
      Food is a coping mechanism; people are afraid of giving it up because then they'll feel confused and lost.
      If you've gone into a marriage and you haven't been clear about how you're going to handle money, how you want to raise kids, who is going to work or stay home or what have you, then you've set yourself up for failure.
      I do not believe, even remotely, that you have to have a partner in your life in order to be whole, in order to be complete, in order to be fulfilled. You just don't have to.
      Now, my body fat runs around 18 percent, which is normal and, you know, kind of in the middle of normal, actually.
      I think you're running into a lot of trouble if your idea of foreplay is, 'Brace yourself honey, here I come!'
      I tell you, if you're in the front row of the parade and you stop walking, pretty soon you're back in the tuba section. And if you want to lead the parade you've got to keep moving.
      I mean, look, teachers don't do their job for the money, obviously, because we pay them ridiculously little amounts for what they put in. Most of them come out of their own pocket for materials and things to help the children and all that.
      I have some wonderful friends from the Mideast that are as red, white and blue as anybody you know, that have been harassed, and I think it's a terrible, terrible thing.
      The problem is that for women, the average time is just over 14 minutes... men are left with about 12 minutes during which time they need to think of something to do!
      Take it from a guy: If you're in love with somebody, you will swim the stream, you will climb the mountain, you will slay the dragon. You're going to get to her somehow, some way.
      I've talked to so many people, men and women alike, that get overweight and their self-esteem just goes in the tank. They think they're judged. They think they're unattractive.
      Every one of us have things that we believe about ourselves when nobody else is looking, nobody else is listening, nobody else is monitoring what we're doing. We believe things about ourself.
      When I was practicing psychology, I used to tell myself if I ever get to where I'm just doing this for the money or I'm just going through the motions, I'll quit.
      Well, let me tell you, if you're 45, had three children and are post-menopausal, you're not going to weigh what you did the day you graduated from high school. Get that out of your head. That's a media-driven ideal that you're never going to healthfully obtain.
      If I was on the air and was just kind of a plain-vanilla personality that took the safe road and the safe way trying to please all of the people all of the time, I'd been gone in two weeks.
      I think every parent, every generation has wanted their children to do better and have a higher standard of living. But I think there's too much guilt.

Phibbing, Philandering, Phil?by Samantha Adamssam@craigandsam.comPhil McGraw dominates the headlines yet again, but who is he, really?  He was born in Oklahoma in a town where I went to school, even though I was born in Texas.  Knowing that Phil lived all over the place and hearing him claim to be a Texan just...well, it chapped my backside.  That's the first thing that made me wonder what he was hiding.  When he talked publicly about his meeting with Britney Spears, his ethics were in question.  When he claimed he was the one who decided to cancel the show with Britney Spears' family, after the family had so publicly pulled the plug, his sincerity was in question.  After reading a few articles, I realized I was looking at a jigsaw puzzle with bits of information scattered all over the place in different interviews given at different times.  Individually, they only revealed a certain aspect of Phil's life; whatever suited the topic at hand.  However, when the puzzle pieces are put together, a new, clearer big picture emerges prompting questions about myths surrounding Dr. Phil:Myth #1  Dr. Phil is a Texan.Myth #2  Dr. Phil is from a small town.Myth #3  His first marriage to his high school sweetheart ended with a mutual parting of the ways.Myth #4  After a football injury in Tulsa, he transferred to Texas college and continued his education.Myth #5  Robin Jameson McGraw was his college sweetheart.Myth #6  He boldly closed his practice in 1989 because he was unhappy and wanted to do more.Myth #7  He is a licensed psychologist.Before diving into these myths, a little background information is necessary.  The following summary is based on excerpts taken directly form interviews given by Dr. Phil, his current wife, Robin, and his ex-wife, Debbie Higgins McCall.  Supplemental facts were obtained from government agencies or acknowledged news sources.  Phillip Calvin McGraw was born in Vinita, Oklahoma September 1, 1950. A CNN transcript puts Dr. Phil in Oklahoma, by his own account, at the age of four. According to the minutes of a City Council meeting in Lakewood, Colorado, Dr. Phil attended "Belmar Elementary and lived on South Everett Street."  He told Reader's Digest in April of 2005 he lived in Denver in Grades 4-6 while his father, an alcoholic, sold drill bits to oil drilling companies.  His father quit or got fired and decided to pursue a degree in psychology. The elder McGraw was accepted at the University of Oklahoma, so he quit drinking and the family moved to Oklahoma City.  After his father got his PhD, Phil and his father moved to Mission, Kansas, part of the Kansas City metro, for Mr. McGraw's internship.    Phil went to school and played football in Mission, Kansas.  His high school sweetheart, Debbie Higgins (McCall) was a cheerleader. In a rare interview, she reveals the they both graduated in 1968.  She went to Southwest Missouri State in Springfield, while Phil went to the University of Tulsa on a football scholarship.  She could only afford one year of collage, so after that year, she returned home to Roeland Park, Kansas. Phil had also moved closer to family after a football injury.  His father had begun practicing psychology in Texas, so Phil moved to Texas.  Phil asked Debbie to move to Lubbock, where he had taken a job at a health spa. In November of 1970 they returned to Roeland Park to get married in Debbie's childhood church.  Eventually, they moved to Topeka, where Phil built and owned a health spa. The marriage ended when friends and neighbors questioned his commitment to the marriage. "When I confronted him about his infidelities he didn't deny these girls and told me that it had nothing to do with his feelings toward me, to grow up, that's the way it was in the world," McCall said. She left him in 1973 and moved back to Kansas City.On August 14, 1976, in Denton, Texas, Dr. Phil married Robin J. Jameson of Duncan, Oklahoma.  She is oftentimes referred to as Dr. Phil's college sweetheart.  In an interview with Goodhousekeeping, in the current edition, Robin said, "Phillip and I were together two and a half, almost three, years before we got married, and we used that entire time to learn."  In another interview with Hour of Power on October 8, 2006, Robin says, "And we will we have now been married 30 years. And we've been together 34 years, but in August it was 30 years that we've been married."In a CNN Interview, Dr. Phil explained his reasons for leaving the psychology field:  "I didn't like what I was doing, that was a gut check because I was making an awful lot of money doing it. And I had a talk with myself. I said, you know, you've been spewing all this all these years bucko, let's just see if you'll put your money where your mouth is and stop doing what you don't like anymore."So, assuming the above is correct, let's get back to those myths, now.Myth #1  Dr. Phil is a Texan.  Phil often harkens back to his southern youth and is partial to predicating a slang term with the phrase, "Now, I'm a Texan."  However, in interviews, Phil talks about living in Oklahoma as a small child, then Colorado, then Oklahoma City, then Kansas City (Mission) then Tulsa.  An article in the Dallas Observer claims by the age of 11 Phil was spending summers in Texas, driving trucks and flying planes.  However, the story does not reveal a source, and Phil has stated in interviews (see summary) he lived in Colorado or Oklahoma at that age. Let's say, for argument's sake, he did spend a few summers with his grandfather in Texas.  Does that really make him a Texan?  It doesn't appear Phil spent any substantial time in Texas until he was practically an adult.  So, where did he get all those quaint southern sayings?  According to the article in the Dallas Observer, perhaps from a former business partner, Thelma Box.  They had a seminar business together (that ended badly) and the sayings Phil uses today were reportedly taken right out of the program, for which she was instrumental.  And that accent?  Based on personal experience living in Oklahoma and in Texas, I can attest that the accents are very similar.Myth #2  Dr. Phil is from a small town.  Phil was born in a small town, but he spent most of his life growing up in big cities - Denver, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Tulsa.  Myth #3  His first marriage to his high school sweetheart ended with a mutual parting of the ways.  Not even close, according to his first wife, who claims she left him because of his infidelity.  Myth #4  After a football injury in Tulsa, he transferred to Texas college and continued his education.  This statement appears in almost every biography of Phil.  It implies that he transferred directly from Tulsa to a college in Texas and continued his education.  However, if reports from his first wife are accurate, Phil went into the health spa business and the couple lived in Kansas.  The "transfer" took about three years.  During that time he narrowly escaped charges for his questionable business practices.  His health spa schemes reportedly ripped off so many people, laws were rewritten to change the rules in Kansas for running health spas.  Phil ended up leaving town in the middle of the night to escape his financial and mounting legal problems.  Many other schemes have surfaced over the years according to these stories from various sources.(WARNING:  BOMB HERE!)Myth #5  Robin Jameson McGraw was his college sweetheart.  I have searched, and I can find no evidence that Robin attended college anywhere at any time.  Based on statements she has given in interviews, it appears she and Phil became a couple in 1972; and Phil wasn't in college during that time, either.  Robin turned 18 in 1972, and Phil turned 22.  Both McGraws have talked openly on Dr. Phil's show about being together for a while before they were married.  In the Good Housekeeping interview, Robin claims they were together "two and a half, almost three years" before they married in 1976.  That nudged the fringe of his first marriage.  In the 2006 interview with Hour of Power, Robin stated they had been married 30 years, but they had been together 34 years.  In 2006, if they had been together for 34 years, that would place the origin of their relationship in 1972.  Phil was married to Debbie Higgins from 1970 to 1973.  Debbie claims she left Phil because of his infidelity.   Myth #6  He boldly closed his practice in 1989 because he was unhappy and wanted to do more.  We all now know the real story behind what happened in 1989 with the "inappropriate dual relationship" with a 19-year-old female patient.  It's been well documented.  Ironically, this was the year he claims psychology became monotonous to him and he had his "gut check" moment when he decided to take the bold leap to close his practice and do something else.  What a coincidence.  Myth #7  He is a licensed psychologist.  (See #6)  He never completed the terms required to have his license reinstated. He is hasn't been licensed to practice psychology anywhere since 1989.Allegations about Dr. Phil abound across the Internet over shady business dealings, problems with his father, infidelity and slick maneuvering in business.  If any of this is true, there are serious credibility problems here.  Have we all been conned?  Could it be that Dr. Phil is not really a person, but merely a role played by a named Phillip McGraw who has no psychology license?  He seems to have an answer for everything that puts him on top.  In the face of adversity, he has the ability to finagle a situation to make it look like he has made the right decision, and he is in control (a la the Britney show).   Perhaps while trying to find his place in life, he stumbled upon a persona that worked and made seminars in Texas a success.  Maybe this persona gave him the charisma he needed to be a star, but it needed a matching background to justify the southern sayings and a deep accent that were crucial to his success.  Maybe Dr. Phil reminds us every chance he gets that he is from Texas, because he's reminding himself that he is this larger-than-life Texan persona called Dr. Phil.  If this is true, it's a shame.  Phillip McGraw could really some advice from Dr. Phil right now.  GET REAL.Samantha Adams

This incessantly upbeat human-behavior expert has been imploring viewers to "get real" ever since he became a regular on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the late 1990s. By 2002, McGraw's down-home demeanor and straightforward counsel was so popular that he earned his own eponymous talk show, in which he helped ordinary people deal with everything from addictions to money troubles to domestic abuse. Because of his touchy-feely persona, Dr. Phil---as he is affectionately known---is often lampooned. However, McGraw has shown he can also be self-deprecating, appearing as himself in the big-screen comedies Scary Movie 4 and Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail. And his astronomical success, including prime-time specials and best-selling books, means he's laughing louder than his detractors---all the way to the bank.Phil McGraw Fast Facts:
Went to the University of Tulsa on a football scholarship, but transferred to Midwestern State University after an injury. 
Dr. Phil Foundation helps provide disadvantaged and foster children with education, housing, job training and medical and mental health services.
