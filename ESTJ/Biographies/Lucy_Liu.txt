Lucy Alexis Liu /ˈluː/ (born Lucy Liu on December 2, 1968) is an American actress, model, artist, and occasional film producer and director. She became known for playing the role of the vicious and ill-mannered Ling Woo in the television series Ally McBeal (1998–2002), for which she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series. Her film work includes starring as one of the heroines in Charlie's Angels, playing one of the enemies of The Bride in Kill Bill, and appearances in Payback, Chicago, and animated hit Kung Fu Panda.
In 2012, Liu joined the cast of the TNT series Southland in the recurring role of Jessica Tang, for which she won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Drama Guest Actress. In 2008 she starred in her own television show, ABC comedy-drama, Cashmere Mafia, which ended after one abbreviated season. The show was one of only a few American television shows to have an Asian American series lead. She is currently co-starring in the Sherlock Holmes-inspired crime drama series Elementary, playing Joan Watson.
Lucy Liu was born on December 2, 1968 in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. In high school, she adopted her middle name Alexis.[2] She is the youngest of three children born to Cecilia, who worked as a biochemist, and Tom Liu, a trained civil engineer who sold digital clock pens to make a living.[3][4] Her parents worked many jobs when Lucy and her siblings were growing up.[5] Liu’s parents were immigrants of chinese descent and they met in New York.[3][6][7] She has an older brother, John,[8][9][10][11] and an older sister, Jenny.[12]
Liu has stated that she grew up in a “diverse” neighborhood. She learned to speak Mandarin at home and began studying English when she was 5.[13] She studied kali-eskrima-silat as a hobby when she was young.[14] Liu attended Joseph Pulitzer Middle School (I.S.145), and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986.[1] She later enrolled at New York University and transferred to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she was a member of the Chi Omega sorority. Liu earned a bachelor’s degree in Asian languages and cultures. Liu worked as a waitress at the Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase club circa 1988–89.[15]
Liu was discovered by an agent at the age of 19 while traveling on the subway. She did one commercial.[16] As a member of the Basement Arts student-run theater group,[17] she auditioned in 1989 for the University of Michigan's production of Alice in Wonderland during her senior year of college. Although she had originally tried out for only a supporting part,[18] Liu was cast in the lead role. While queuing up to audition for the musical Miss Saigon in 1990, she told The New York Times, “There aren’t many Asian roles, and it’s very difficult to get your foot in the door.”[19] In May 1992, Liu made her New York stage debut in Fairy Bones, directed by Tina Chen.[20]
Liu had small roles in films and TV, marking her debut. She was cast in both The X-Files in “Hell Money” and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys in “The March to Freedom,” before landing a role on Ally McBeal. Liu originally auditioned for the role of 'Nelle Porter' (played by Portia de Rossi), and the character Ling Woo was later created specifically for her. Liu’s part on the series was originally temporary, but high audience ratings secured Liu as a permanent cast member. Additionally, she earned an Emmy[21] nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.[18] In Payback (1999), Liu portrayed Pearl, a high-class BDSM prostitute with links to the Chinese mafia.
Liu was cast as Alex Munday, one of the three angels in the movie version of Charlie's Angels, alongside Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz. The film opened in November 2000 and earned more than $125 million in the United States. Charlie's Angels earned a worldwide total of more than $264 million. The sequel, Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, opened in June 2003 and also did well at the box office, earning $100 million in the U.S. and a worldwide total of more than $259 million. Liu also starred with Antonio Banderas in Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, a critical and box office failure.
In 2000 she hosted Saturday Night Live with Jay-Z. Liu starred as lawyer Grace Chin on Ugly Betty in the episodes “Derailed” and “Icing on the Cake.” In a 2001 episode of Sex and the City entitled “Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda” she guest starred as herself, playing a new client of character Samantha Jones who does public relations. She starred in the Sex and the City–inspired TV show Cashmere Mafia on ABC. Liu also made a cameo appearance on animated shows Futurama (as herself and robot duplicates in the episodes “I Dated a Robot” and “Love and Rocket”) and The Simpsons (on the season 16 episode ”Goo Goo Gai Pan.”)
In 2002 Liu played Rita Foster in Vincenzo Natali’s Brainstorm (a k a Cypher). Soon thereafter, she appeared as O-Ren Ishii in Quentin Tarantino’s 2003 film, Kill Bill. She won an MTV Award for Best Movie Villain for the part. Subsequently, Liu appeared on several episodes of Joey with Matt LeBlanc, who played her love interest in the Charlie's Angels films. She also had minor roles as Kitty Baxter in the film Chicago and as a psychologist opposite Keira Knightley in the thriller Domino. In Lucky Number Slevin, she played the leading love interest to Josh Hartnett. 3 Needles was released on December 1, 2006, Liu portrayed Jin Ping, an HIV-positive Chinese woman.[22]
In 2007 Liu appeared in Code Name: The Cleaner; Rise, a supernatural thriller co-starring Michael Chiklis in which Liu plays an undead reporter[13] (for which she was ranked number 41 on “Top 50 Sexiest Vampires”);[23] and Watching the Detectives, an independent romantic comedy co-starring Cillian Murphy. She made her producer debut and also starred in a remake of Charlie Chan, which had been planned as early as 2000.[18]
In 2007 Empire named Liu number 96 of their “100 Sexiest Movie Stars.”[24] The producers of Dirty Sexy Money created a role for Liu as a series regular. Liu played Nola Lyons, a powerful attorney who faced Nick George (Peter Krause).[25] Liu voiced Silvermist in Disney Fairies and Viper in Kung Fu Panda.[18]
In March 2010, Liu made her Broadway debut in the Tony Award–winning play God of Carnage as Annette on the second replacement cast alongside Jeff Daniels, Janet McTeer, and Dylan Baker.[26] In March 2012, she was cast as Joan Watson for Elementary. Elementary is an American Sherlock Holmes adaption, and the role Liu was offered is traditionally played by men.[27] She also has played police officer Jessica Tang on Southland, a television show focusing on the lives of police officers and detectives in Los Angeles as a recurring guest actor during the fourth season.[28][29] She received the Critics’ Choice Television Award for Best Drama Guest Actress for this role.[30]
Liu had previously presented her artwork under a pseudonym, Yu Ling (which is her Chinese name).[3][34] Liu, who is an artist in several media, has had several gallery shows showcasing her collage, paintings, and photography.[35] She began doing collage mixed media when she was 16 years old, and became a photographer and painter.[36] Liu attended the New York Studio School for drawing, painting, and sculpture from 2004 to 2006.[22]
In September 2006, Liu held an art show and donated her share of the profits to UNICEF.[36][37] She also had another show in 2008 in Munich. Her painting “Escape” was incorporated into Montblanc’s Cutting Edge Art Collection and was shown during Art Basel Miami 2008, which showed works by contemporary American artists.[38] Liu has stated that she donated her share of the profits from the NYC Milk Gallery gallery show to UNICEF.[39] In London, portion of the proceeds from her book Seventy Two went to UNICEF.[40]
In 2001 Liu was the spokesman for the Lee National Denim Day fundraiser, which raises millions of dollars for breast cancer research and education.[41] In 2004 Liu was appointed an ambassador for U.S. Fund for UNICEF.[40] She traveled to Pakistan and Lesotho, among several other countries.[18] She also hosted an MTV documentary, Traffic, for the MTV EXIT campaign in 2007. In 2008, Liu produced and narrated the short film The Road to Traffik, about the Cambodian heroine Somaly Mam. The film was directed by Kerry Girvin and co-produced by photographer Norman Jean Roy. This led to a partnership with producers on the documentary film Redlight.[42][43] Early in 2006, Liu received an “Asian Excellence Award” for Visibility.[44] Liu is a supporter of marriage equality for gays and lesbians, and she became a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign in 2011.[45] She has teamed up with Heinz to combat the widespread global health threat of iron deficiency anemia and vitamin and mineral malnutrition among infants and children in the developing world.[46]
In 1991 Liu underwent surgery after a breast cancer scare. “The doctor sort of felt and said it was cancer and it needs to come out. I went into shell-shock. It was pretty traumatising.” The lump was removed just two days after the doctor’s examination and was found to be benign.[47]
Liu has studied various religions, such as Kabbalah, Buddhism, and Taoism. She has stated, "I’m into all things spiritual—anything to do with meditation or charts or any of that stuff. I studied Chinese philosophy in school. There’s something in the metaphysical that I find very fascinating."[14]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Born to immigrants in Queens, New York, Lucy Liu has always tried to balance an interest in her cultural heritage with a desire to move beyond a strictly Asian-American experience. Lucy's mother is from Beijing, and her father is from Shanghai. Once relegated to "ethnic" parts, the energetic actress is finally earning her stripes as an across-the-board leading lady.Liu graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986 and enrolled in New York University; discouraged by the "dark and sarcastic" atmosphere of NYU, however, she transferred to the University of Michigan after her freshman year. She graduated from UM with a degree in Chinese Language and Culture, managing to squeeze in some additional training in dance, voice, fine arts, and acting. During her senior year, Liu auditioned for a small part in a production of Alice in Wonderland and walked away with the lead; encouraged by the experience, she decided to take the plunge into professional acting. She moved to Los Angeles and split her time between auditions and food service day jobs, eventually scoring a guest appearance as a waitress on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like NYPD Blue (1993), ER (1994), and The X Files (1993). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on Rhea Perlman's ephemeral sitcom Pearl (1996).Liu first appeared on the big screen as an ex-girlfriend in Jerry Maguire (1996) (she had previously filmed a scene in the indie Bang (1995), but it was shelved for two years). She then waded through a series of supporting parts in small films before landing her big break on Ally McBeal (1997). Liu initially auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter, which went to Portia de Rossi, but writer-producer David E. Kelley was so impressed with her that he promised to write a part for her in an upcoming episode. The part turned out to be that of growling, ill-tempered lawyer Ling Woo, which Liu filled with such aplomb that she was signed on as a regular cast member.The "Ally" win gave Liu's film career a much-needed boost--in 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the Mel Gibson action flick Payback (1999), and as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga Play It to the Bone (1999). The next year brought even larger roles: first as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in Jackie Chan's western Shanghai Noon (2000), then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in Charlie's Angels (2000).When she's not hissing at clients or throwing well-coiffed punches, Liu keeps busy with an eclectic mix of off-screen hobbies. She practices the martial art of Kali-Eskrima-Silat (knife-and-stick fighting), skis, rock climbs, rides horses, and plays the accordion. In 1993 she exhibited a collection of multimedia art pieces at the Cast Iron Gallery in SoHo (New York), after which she won a grant to study and create art in China. Her hectic schedule doesn't leave much time for romantic intrigue, but Liu says she prefers to keep that side of her life uncluttered.
      Graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor with a degree in Asian languages and cultures.
      Chosen by Goldsea Asian American Daily as one of the "100 Most Inspiring Asian Americans of All Time" (ranked #51).
      Award of Merit for voice-over in "The No Name Painting Association" at the Best Shorts Competition 2013.
      I grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens, with no money. I was taught not to take anything for granted. If you are too busy being a diva or a freak, then you are not enjoying it.
      [about Ally McBeal (1997)] It's so much fun playing her [Ling], but I have this fear that people are going to run away from me in terror on the streets. They think I'm going to bite their heads off or something.
      I'm so proud of my heritage, but yes, I think there's always a danger when people put you on a pedestal. Especially when you're just trying to live your life and pursue your dreams. The intention is not to represent Asian Americans, but to be an Asian American who is working as an actress. People often confuse the two. When you are "representing," you have the burden of some people projecting their hopes onto you. This can eventually lead to a certain amount of disappointment. I strive to not deny myself experiences that open up to me. I hope to live without looking back in regret. If people want to join me on the ride, then I'm happy to have them along.
      Martial arts are art forms and require a great deal of discipline and dedication. I so admire people who focus their lives on it, because it's not an easy thing to do.
      It's really taking a while but I do think it's becoming more acceptable to cast Asians in roles that weren't originally slated for someone who is Asian, which is so great.
      I try to believe like I believed when I was five...when my heart told me everything I needed to know.
      [on playing a female version of the "Dr. Watson" character in Elementary (2012)] I think flawed characters, having a history and a mysterious past, are always going to keep the audience engaged. Naturally, the connection between the two of them [i.e. with "Sherlock Holmes"] is his oddities and, you know, his inability to be as stable as most people would like to be. She's just as unstable, but not as obvious, because she's trying to distract her own problems with his problems.

=======================================================
Lucy Alexis Liu was born to Chinese immigrant parents in Queens, New York to a civil engineer father and biochemist mother. She is the youngest of three children, having an older brother and sister.
Determined to allow their daughter a good grounding for her American life, Liu was sent to the prestigious Stuyvesant High School where she graduated in 1986. She went on to New York University but only stayed for one year before transferring to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. She graduated in 1990 with a degree in Asian languages and culture.
Taking a shine to acting, dancing and singing, Liu auditioned for a supporting part in the university production of Alice in Wonderland in her final year. To her surprise, she won the lead role. Liu, an Asian- American student, found herself portraying Alice, a blue-eyed blonde. The performance spurred her to take up acting as a career.
Starting with a brief turn on Beverly Hills 90210, Liu was cast in many walk-on parts in shows like NYPD Blue, ER, The X Files and Tom Cruise vehicle Jerry Maguire. In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student, a regular on Rhea Perlman's sitcom Pearl.
Continuing the audition trail, Liu tried out for the role of Nell Porter in Ally McBeal, which eventually went to Portia de Rossi. Producers spotted Liu's talent and wrote the bitchy-aggressor character of Ling Woo. Initially, Ling Woo was supposed to appear on a handful of episodes but positive audience feedback secured Liu as a permanent cast member. The way Liu delivered such acerbic lines as, “Are you retarded, Jacob?'' to a young boy who believed in Santa Claus made her a viewer favourite.
Music from the Wicked Witch of the West was played each time Ling Woo walked into the room. She became one of the most popular characters in the show; the antithesis of Calista Flockhart's dithering McBeal. A scene where the pair locked lips became the stuff of small screen legend and titillation. She played Ling Woo for 36 episodes between 1998 and 2000 - a role which earned her an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.
She also found success as a visual artist, with mixed media compositions frequently on display in galleries in New York and Los Angeles. In 1994, she was given a grant to study in China based on her show at SoHo's Cast Iron Gallery. The time immersed in Chinese culture changed her approach to art and activism.
The successful two-year stint as Ling Woo opened doors to film roles where Liu would eventually rise to Hollywood A-lister. In 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the Mel Gibson action flick Payback. Then came a role as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga Play It to the Bone. By 2000 she starred alongside Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in Shanghai Noon and then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in Charlie's Angels.
As one of the three Angels, she was awarded equal status with the infinitely more famous Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz. However, there were rumours that Liu was difficult on set. It was said that she hit co-star Bill Murray. Later, the rumour was scaled down to a mere verbal argument. She was also reportedly unhappy at not being given the same treatment as Barrymore and Diaz. Liu denied the behaviour saying, “It's too bad people keep saying that I am the cause of all these arguments. I never started any fights.’’
One of the film’s producers stepped in to back her up by admitting there were some on set problems but that they were “normal occurrences between people’’. The Angel’s role proved Liu had a strong physicality and set her up nicely for an upcoming part in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill.
On a visit to the UK, while promoting Charlie’s Angels, Liu revealed an unlikely passion for Manchester United. She told reporters that she started supporting the Red Devils when she found out that she had relatives in northern England. Her all-time favourite player is David Beckham. “I think he's lovely. He's definitely the best player,” she was quoted as saying at the time.
In 2003, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill was released. Liu now replaced Uma Thurman who had to drop out of the project because she was pregnant with her second child. Liu played O-Ren Ishii (Cottonmouth), one of the major villains. She was able to put her martial arts skills to the test in the role. She said: “This particular movie was different because I was doing something I'd never done before ever, and working on the Samurai sword is very different because your body position has to be very still. It's a much quieter way of fighting.’’
In her spare time, she practices kali-eskrima-silat, a martial art involving sticks and knives. But while she was able to show off her skills in the Charlie's Angels movies and Shanghai Noon, she has never had to use them to defend herself in real life. “Thank God. But it has made me more aggressive,’’ the 1.57m actress once said: “If somebody is confrontational or rude, it makes me more confident. Its like: ‘No, you don't treat somebody that way.' It gives you an inner strength. And that's what martial arts should be; it should come from inside.’’
While tending to be quiet about her private life, the star was said to have seduced George Clooney with oysters and once set her heart on Matt Damon. In 2004, it was widely reported Liu planned to marry her writer boyfriend Zach Helm after dating for about a year. Liu described him as her soulmate and said the wedding would not be a glitzy Hollywood affair. She told reporters: “Neither of us is into big showy events. It will be for friends and family. It should be an emotional time, not another movie set.'' However, the couple broke it off before they could make it up the aisle.
As a UNICEF goodwill Ambassador, Liu has been the public figurehead for at least two major awareness campaigns: in 2007 she toured the Congo and in 2005 she visited parts of Pakistan devastated by earthquake.
In 2006, Liu played Jin Ping in 3 Needles, a look at the worldwide AIDS crisis. It was during this film that she took her mother on set with her for the first time. “But she couldn't understand why I was doing the same thing over and over again for no money,” she admitted.

Despite initially auditioning for the more subdued role of Nelle Porter (the part ultimately went to Portia de Rossi), this lovely Asian-American actress made her name and earned an Emmy nod as domineering lawyer Ling Woo on Ally McBeal. Although TV guest spots early in her career proved she could play meek, particularly her recurring role on ER as the soft-spoken mother of an AIDS-stricken child, audiences preferred her feistier side. Able to inspire both dread and desire with the cock of an eyebrow, Liu fared best in big-screen supporting parts that showcased her martial-arts prowess and quirky comedic talents, like her kick-ass turns in Kill Bill: Vol I and the Charlie's Angels franchise. But Liu's artistic talents go beyond the stage and screen. She's also an accomplished painter and photographer who has had exhibits in Los Angeles and New York.Lucy Liu Fast Facts:

Elementary Finale: Is Mycroft Really Being Framed?May 14, 2014 06:37 PM ETby Natalie AbramsSherlock Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller) will have at least one last big mystery to solve before Elementary signs off for Season 2 — and this particular case could be life or death.
Mycroft Holmes (Rhys Ifans) has been somewhat of a mystery since making his first appearance earlier this season, and for good reason: The languid lout has been lying to his brother the whole time. It turns out, Mycroft has been working as an asset for MI-6, using his restaurants as a way to gather intel for Britain's secret intelligence agency.
But, in another twist, Mycroft left MI-6 years ago, only forced to recently return to secretly protect his brother from prosecution after unknowingly helping a terrorist during his drug spiral in London. That being said, it seemed easy to fall in line with Sherlock's theory that Mycroft was being framed for the murder of an MI-6 analyst who had uncovered a mole within the agency. But what if Mycroft isn't being framed at all and actually is the mole?

Question: I started watching Scandal from the start, when it was simply a problem-of-the-week plot mixed in with a little soap opera with Olivia and the President. They lost me a little bit last year when they temporarily dropped that element to completely focus on the soap opera element when the president was shot. With the addition of the B613 storyline (and possible new Harrison storyline), I feel the show has lost its focus. I was highly enjoying Lisa Kudrow's story and performance only to have the show dragged down by B613's machinations and apparent manipulation of Quinn. I get the fear the show could be the political Love Boat where the guest stars get all the meaty storylines, but I watch shows like Strike Back for my spy action and adventure. Have these writers learned nothing from the mistakes countless shows including Alias and recently Revenge have made with these over-the-top secret maniacal agencies? — Brian
Is this Alice or Alias? Something to ponder while navigating the deluxe rabbit-hole theme-park ride of ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland spinoff (Thursday, 8/7c), in which a feisty and literally kick-ass Alice (Sophie Lowe) battles her way out of insane-asylum confinement with Sydney Bristow-level brio. She even has a Will Tippen-like sidekick in the sheepishly raffish Knave of Hearts (Michael Socha of the British Being Human), who stands by as Alice goes all action heroine.

Lucy LiuAKA Lucy Alexis LiuBorn: 2-Dec-1968Birthplace: Queens, NYGender: FemaleRace or Ethnicity: AsianSexual orientation: See Note [1]Occupation: ActorNationality: United StatesExecutive summary: Ling on Ally McBealLucy Liu is the daughter of Chinese immigrants to America, and was raised in an Italian neighborhood in New York City. While studying Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of Michigan, she auditioned for a small role in the school production of Alice in Wonderland as envisioned by Andre Gregory, assuming she was the wrong ethnicity to play the lead. But she was cast as Alice, drew good notices, and decided to become an actress.
When Liu first came to Hollywood, she earned the rent by working in a massage parlor and as a waitress, and in her first professional role she played a waitress at the Peach Pit diner in an early episode of Beverly Hills, 90210. In 1995 she played the mother of an AIDS patient in several episodes on ER. In her first noteworthy big screen role, she played one of Tom Cruise's ex-girlfriends in Jerry Maguire, then took a featured role as a college student obsessed with getting good grades on the mid-1990s sitcom Pearl with Rhea Perlman and Malcolm McDowell. She played a stripper in City of Industry with Harvey Keitel and a dominatrix in Payback with Mel Gibson. Her biggest break came on TV's Ally McBeal with Calista Flockhart, where Liu played the brutally honest, ever-litigious Ling Woo.
She had an almost-starring role as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in Shanghai Noon with Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. She played one of Charlie's Angels with Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz, but reportedly did not get along with Bill Murray on the set, leading to Murray's replacement by Bernie Mac in the sequel. She starred opposite Antonio Banderas in the action flop Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, had a small but pivotal role as a murdering mistress in the jails of Chicago with Renée Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, played the deadly crimelord Cottonmouth, leader of the Crazy 88s, in Kill Bill Vol. 1 with Uma Thurman, and starred as the risen-from-the-dead reporter in the thriller Rise with Michael Chiklis.
Liu speaks fluent Mandarin and Italian and adequate French and Japanese, plays the accordion, and is proficient in Kali Eskrima Silat, a form of Indonesian knife and stick fighting. She produced Freedom's Fury, a 2006 documentary about the 1956 Olympic semifinal water polo match between Hungary and Russia, held just after Russia invaded Hungary.
[1] No known liaisons with females. But this juicy but inconclusive quote from Jane magazine, which is no longer published: "I think people sometimes get the wrong impression when they're like, Oh, well, so-and-so was straight and then she was gay, and now she's straight again, you know? But it's like, how many times do I have to kiss a woman before I'm gay? Everybody wants to label people. Sometimes you just fall in love with somebody, and you're really not thinking about what gender or whatever they happen to be. It think that if I happen to fall in love with a woman, everyone's going to make a big deal out of it. But if I happen to fall in love with a man, nobody cares."
