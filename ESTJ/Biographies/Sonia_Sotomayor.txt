Sonia Maria Sotomayor (/ˈsoʊnjə ˌsoʊtoʊmaɪˈjɔr/, Spanish: [ˈsonja sotomaˈʝor];[3] born June 25, 1954) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, serving since August 2009. Sotomayor is the Court's 111th justice, its first Hispanic justice, and its third female justice.
Sotomayor was born in The Bronx, New York City and is of Puerto Rican descent. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1976 and received her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was an editor at the Yale Law Journal. She was an advocate for the hiring of Latino faculty at both schools. She worked as an assistant district attorney in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the New York City Campaign Finance Board.
Sotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991, and her nomination was confirmed in 1992. In 1997, she was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was slowed by the Republican majority in the United States Senate, but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.
In May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court to replace retired Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. On the court, Sotomayor has been a reliable member of the liberal bloc when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.
Sonia Maria Sotomayor[4] was born in the Bronx, a borough of New York City.[5] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1921),[6] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[7][8][9] and her mother was Celina Báez (born 1927),[10] an orphan[11] from the neighborhood of Santa Rosa in Lajas, a still mostly rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[9] They left Puerto Rico, met, and married during World War II after Celina served in the Women's Army Corps.[12][13] Juan Sotomayor had a third-grade education, did not speak English, and worked as a tool and die worker;[7] Celina Baez worked as a telephone operator and then a practical nurse.[6] Sonia's younger brother, Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1957), is a physician and university professor in the Syracuse, New York, area.[14][15]
Sotomayor was raised a Catholic[2] and grew up among other Puerto Ricans who settled in the South Bronx and East Bronx; she self-identifies as a "Nuyorican".[12] At first, she lived in a South Bronx tenement.[16] In 1957, the family moved to the well-maintained, racially and ethnically mixed, working-class Bronxdale Houses housing project[16][17][18] in Soundview (which has at times been considered part of both the East Bronx and South Bronx).[19][20][21] Her relative proximity to Yankee Stadium led to her becoming a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees.[22] The extended family got together frequently[16] and regularly visited Puerto Rico during summers.[23]
Sonia grew up with an alcoholic father and a mother who was emotionally distant; she felt closest to her grandmother, who she later said gave her a source of "protection and purpose".[11] Sonia was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age seven,[7] and began taking daily insulin injections.[24] Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old.[6][16] After this, she became fluent in English.[7] Sotomayor has said that she was first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the Perry Mason television series.[7][22][24] She reflected in 1998: "I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew that when I was ten. Ten. That's no jest."[22]
Celina Sotomayor put great stress on the value of education; she bought the Encyclopædia Britannica for her children, something unusual in the housing projects.[12] Despite the distance between the two, which became even worse after her father's death and which was not fully reconciled until decades later,[11] Sotomayor has credited her mother with being her "life inspiration".[25] For grammar school, Sotomayor attended Blessed Sacrament School in Soundview,[26] where she was valedictorian and had a near-perfect attendance record.[21][27] Although underage, Sotomayor worked at a local retail store; she also worked at a hospital.[28] Sotomayor passed the entrance tests for, then commuted to, Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx.[29][30] Meanwhile, the Bronxdale Houses had fallen victim to increasing heroin use, crime, and the emergence of the Black Spades gang.[16] In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City in the Northeast Bronx.[16] At Cardinal Spellman, Sotomayor was on the forensics team and was elected to the student government.[29][30] She graduated as valedictorian in 1972.[12]
When Sotomayor entered Princeton University on a full scholarship,[31] there were few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20).[12][32] She knew only of the Bronx and Puerto Rico,[33] and she later described her initial Princeton experience as like "a visitor landing in an alien country."[34] She was too intimidated to ask questions for her first year there;[34] her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics.[35] She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence.[12][32][35] She became a moderate student activist[29][36] and co-chair of the Acción Puertorriqueña organization, which looked for more opportunities for Puerto Rican students and served as a social and political hub for them.[12][37][38] She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.[39] Sotomayor focused in particular on faculty hiring and curriculum; at the time, Princeton did not have a single full-time Latino professor nor any class on Latin America.[40] Sotomayor later addressed the curriculum issue in an opinion piece in the college paper: "Not one permanent course in this university now deals in any notable detail with the Puerto Rican or Chicano cultures."[41] After a visit to university president William G. Bowen in her sophomore year did not produce results,[38] the organization filed a formal letter of complaint in April 1974 with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, saying the school discriminated in its hiring and admission practices.[37][40][42] Sotomayor told The New York Times at the time that "Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making substantive efforts to change,"[42] and she wrote opinion pieces for the Daily Princetonian with the same theme.[12] The university began to hire Latino faculty,[36][40] and Sotomayor established an ongoing dialogue with Bowen.[39] Sotomayor also successfully persuaded historian Peter Winn to create a seminar on Puerto Rican history and politics.[40] Sotomayor joined the governance board of Princeton's Third World Center and served on the university's student–faculty Discipline Committee, which issued rulings on student infractions.[39][43] She also ran an after-school program for local children[36] and volunteered as an interpreter for Latino patients at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital.[12][33][44]
A history major, Sotomayor received almost all A's in her final two years of college.[43] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis at Princeton on Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, and on the territory's struggles for economic and political self-determination.[12] The 178-page work, "La Historia Ciclica de Puerto Rico: The Impact of the Life of Luis Muñoz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto Rico, 1930–1975",[45] won honorable mention for the Latin American Studies Thesis Prize.[46] As a senior, Sotomayor won the Pyne Prize, the top award for undergraduates, which reflected both strong grades and extracurricular activities.[12][29][43] In 1976, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa[12][47] and awarded an A.B. from Princeton, graduating summa cum laude.[48] Sotomayor has described her time at Princeton as a life-changing experience.[49]
On August 14, 1976, just after graduating from Princeton, Sotomayor married Kevin Edward Noonan, whom she had dated since high school,[8][12] in a small chapel at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.[30] She used the married name Sonia Sotomayor de Noonan.[50][51][52] He became a biologist and a patent lawyer.[12]
In the fall of 1976, Sotomayor entered Yale Law School, again on a scholarship.[22] This, too, was a place with very few Latinos.[38] She fit in well and was known as a hard worker, but she was not considered among the top stars of her class.[17][51] Yale General Counsel and professor José A. Cabranes was an early mentor to her and helped her to understand how she could be successful within "the system".[53] She became an editor of the Yale Law Journal[8] and was also managing editor of the student-run Yale Studies in World Public Order publication, which is now known as the Yale Journal of International Law.[54] Sotomayor published a law review note on the effect of possible Puerto Rican statehood on the island's mineral and ocean rights.[12][29] She was a semi-finalist in the Barristers Union mock trial competition.[54] She was co-chair of a group for Latin, Asian, and Native American students, and in her advocacy pushed for hiring more Hispanics for the faculty of the law school.[32][38]
Following her second year, she gained a job as a summer associate with the prominent New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.[55] By own her later evaluation, her performance there was lacking.[56] She did not receive an offer for a full-time position, an experience that she later described as a "kick in the teeth" and one that would bother her for years.[55][56] In her third year, she filed a formal complaint against the established Washington, D.C., law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge for suggesting during a recruiting dinner that she was at Yale only via affirmative action.[29][38] Sotomayor refused to be interviewed by the firm further and filed her complaint with a faculty–student tribunal, which ruled in her favor.[38][40] Her action triggered a campus-wide debate,[53] and news of the firm's subsequent December 1978 apology made The Washington Post.[50] In 1979, she was awarded a J.D. from Yale Law School.[8] She was admitted to the New York Bar in 1980.[52][57]
On the recommendation of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired out of law school as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979.[8][53] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem."[58] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court.[59] Working in the trial division,[60] she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders.[8][12][61] She also worked on cases involving police brutality.[31] She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses.[61][62] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate.[61] She helped convict the "Tarzan Murderer" (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason) in 1983 in her highest-profile case.[59][63] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous."[58] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: "The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other."[7] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time.[29] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness.[22][59][64] One of her job evaluations labelled her a "potential superstar".[62] Morgenthau later described her as "smart, hard-working, [and having] a lot of common sense,"[65] and as a "fearless and effective prosecutor."[31] She stayed a typical length of time in the post[58] and had a common reaction to the job: "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life."[66]
Sotomayor and Noonan divorced amicably in 1983;[62] they did not have children.[20] She has said that the pressures of her working life were a contributing factor, but not the major factor, in the breakup.[64][67]
From 1983 to 1986, Sotomayor had an informal solo practice, dubbed Sotomayor & Associates, located in her Brooklyn apartment.[68] She performed legal consulting work, often for friends or family members.[68]
In 1984, she entered private practice, joining the commercial litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate.[7][69] One of 30 attorneys in the law firm,[69] she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration.[7][31][70][71] She later said, "I wanted to complete myself as an attorney."[22] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job.[69] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than be part of a larger law firm.[69] Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States;[29] much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods.[12][69] In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle.[12][69] She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run "much like a drug operation", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by "Fendi Crush", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green.[72] At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes.[69] In a 1986 appearance on Good Morning America that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college.[67] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm;[35][54] she was paid well but not extravagantly.[73] She left in 1992 when she became a judge.[8]
In addition to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles.[74] She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent.[74] Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron.[65][74] In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor to the board of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992.[75] As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history,[75] the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and AIDS hospices.[7] Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective.[65][74] She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.[74][75]
Sotomayor was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 as one of the founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years.[7][76] There she took a vigorous role[74] in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure.[77] Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members.[65][74] She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.[74]
Based upon another recommendation from Cabranes,[65] Sotomayor was a member of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992.[78] There she was a top policy maker[7] who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights.[78] The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.[78]
During 1985 and 1986, Sotomayor served on the board of the Maternity Center Association, a Manhattan-based non-profit group which focused on improving the quality of maternity care.[79][80][81]
Sotomayor had wanted to become a judge since she was in elementary school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.[7] Moynihan had an arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly one out of every four New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House.[49][82][83] Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York.[20] When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said "Have we got a judge for you!"[7] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.[12][74] D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor,[84] who was seen as politically centrist at the time.[7][20] Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all."[7]
Sotomayor was thus nominated on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker, Jr.[5] Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee.[7][84][85] Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee.[84][86] D'Amato objected strongly;[86] some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent[60][84] of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.[5]
Sotomayor became the youngest judge in the Southern District[87] and the first Hispanic federal judge in New York State.[88] She became the first Puerto Rican woman to serve as a judge in a U.S. federal court.[89] She was one of seven women among the district's 58 judges.[7] She moved from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, back to the Bronx in order to live within her district.[7]
Sotomayor generally kept a low public profile as a district court judge.[22] She showed a willingness to take anti-government positions in a number of cases, and during her first year in the seat, she received high ratings from liberal public-interest groups.[20] Other sources and organizations regarded her as a centrist during this period.[7][20] In criminal cases, she gained a reputation for tough sentencing and was not viewed as a pro-defense judge.[90] A Syracuse University study found that in such cases, Sotomayor generally handed out longer sentences than her colleagues, especially when white-collar crime was involved.[91] Fellow district judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum was an influence on Sotomayor in adopting a narrow, "just the facts" approach to judicial decision-making.[53]
As a trial judge, she garnered a reputation for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight schedule.[20] Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, "She does not have much patience for people trying to snow her. You can't do it."[20]
On March 30, 1995, in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc.,[92] Sotomayor issued a preliminary injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new collective bargaining agreement and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, the day before the new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.[22][93][94] The decision raised her profile,[12] won her the plaudits of baseball fans,[22] and had a lasting effect on the game.[95]
In Dow Jones v. Department of Justice (1995),[96] Sotomayor sided with the Wall Street Journal in its efforts to obtain and publish a photocopy of the last note left by former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Sotomayor ruled that the public had "a substantial interest"[97] in viewing the note and enjoined the U.S. Justice Department from blocking its release.
In New York Times Co. v. Tasini (1997), freelance journalists sued the New York Times Company for copyright infringement for the New York Times' inclusion in an electronic archival database (LexisNexis) of the work of freelancers it had published. Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancer's work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.[98]
In Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group (also in 1997), Sotomayor ruled that a book of trivia from the television program Seinfeld infringed on the copyright of the show's producer and did not constitute legal fair use. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's ruling.
On June 25, 1997, Sotomayor was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was vacated by J. Daniel Mahoney.[5] Her nomination was initially expected to have smooth sailing,[22][99] with the American Bar Association giving her a "well qualified" professional assessment,[100] but as The New York Times described, "[it became] embroiled in the sometimes tortured judicial politics of the Senate."[101] Some in the Republican majority believed Clinton was eager to name the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice and that an easy confirmation to the appeals court would put Sotomayor in a better position for a possible Supreme Court nomination (despite there being no vacancy at the time nor any indication the Clinton administration was considering nominating her or any Hispanic), and therefore they decided to slow her confirmation.[17][99][101] Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh weighed in that Sotomayor was an ultraliberal who was on a "rocket ship" to the highest court.[99]
During her September 1997 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sotomayor parried strong questioning from some Republican members about mandatory sentencing, gay rights, and her level of respect for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.[85] After a long wait, she was approved by the committee in March 1998, with only two dissensions.[85][99] However, in June 1998, the influential Wall Street Journal editorial page opined that the Clinton administration intended to "get her on to the Second Circuit, then elevate her to the Supreme Court as soon as an opening occurs"; the editorial criticized two of her district court rulings and urged further delay of her confirmation.[102] The Republican block continued.[22][99]
Ranking Democratic committee member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican use of a secret hold to slow down the Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee.[99][103] The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.[104]
During 1998, several Hispanic organizations organized a petition drive in New York State, generating hundreds of signatures from New Yorkers to try to convince New York Republican senator Al D'Amato to push the Senate leadership to bring Sotomayor's nomination to a vote.[105] D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year,[105] helped move Republican leadership.[12] Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote.[101] With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch,[101] Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote.[106] She received her commission on October 7.[5] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: "That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [that] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today."[22]
Over her ten years on the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions where she was in the majority.[12] The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming two[12]—not high numbers for an appellate judge of that many years[17] and a typical percentage of reversals.[107]
Sotomayor's circuit court rulings led to her being considered a political centrist by the ABA Journal[71][108] and other sources and organizations.[71][87][108][109][110][111] Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations.[112][113][114] In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues.[17] Sotomayor tended to write narrow rulings that relied on close application of the law rather than import general philosophical viewpoints.[17] A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent, an emphasis on the facts of a case, and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role.[115] Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose.[116] Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.[117]
Across some 150 cases involving business and civil law, Sotomayor's rulings were generally unpredictable and not consistently pro-business or anti-business.[118] Sotomayor's influence in the federal judiciary, as measured by the number of citations of her rulings by other judges and in law review articles, increased significantly during the length of her appellate judgeship and was greater than that of some other prominent federal appeals court judges.[119] Two academic studies showed that the percentage of Sotomayor's decisions that overrode policy decisions by elected branches was the same as or lower than that of other circuit judges.[120]
Sotomayor was a member of the Second Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.[98] In October 2001, she presented the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial Lecture at UC Berkeley School of Law;[15] titled "A Latina Judge's Voice"; it was published in the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal the following spring.[121][122] In the speech, she discussed the characteristics of her Latina upbringing and culture and the history of minorities and women ascending to the federal bench.[123] She said the low number of minority women on the federal bench at that time was "shocking".[38] She then discussed at length how her own experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge.[123] In any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent.[38] An expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time.[124] Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's opinions.[125]
In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor gained a reputation for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes to the point of brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions.[12][126] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a "hot bench", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions.[126][127] Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns.[127] The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor.[12] Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, "She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, temperamental."[126] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, "She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand."[126] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been "totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational."[126] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, "Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple."[126] Sotomayor's law clerks regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.[128]
In 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, to President George W. Bush as an acceptable nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.[129]
In the 2002 decision Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush,[130] Sotomayor upheld the Bush administration's implementation of the Mexico City Policy, which states that "the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations."[131] Sotomayor held that the policy did not constitute a violation of equal protection, as "the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds."[130]
In Pappas v. Giuliani (2002),[132] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the New York Police Department could terminate from his desk job an employee who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the First Amendment protected speech by the employee "away from the office, on [his] own time", even if that speech was "offensive, hateful, and insulting", and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.[133]
In 2005, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for United States v. Quattrone.[134] Frank Quattrone had been on trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. Some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order to forbid the publication of the juror's names. In United States v. Quattrone, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be free to publish the names of the jurors. The first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, and the district court ordered the media not to publish the names of jurors, even though those names had been disclosed in open court. Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press to "to report freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom".[134]
In 2008, Sotomayor was on a three-judge panel in Doninger v. Niehoff[135] that unanimously affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge Debra Livingston, the district court's judgment that Lewis S. Mills High School did not violate the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running for student government after she called the superintendent and other school officials "douchebags" in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged students to call an administrator and "piss her off more".[135] Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech "foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment",[136] which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.[135] Although Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who disagree with it.[137]
Sotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo (2009).[138] Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's per curiam opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in Presser v. Illinois, a Supreme Court case from 1886, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment "is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state".[138] With respect to the Presser v. Illinois precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has "the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,"[139] and the recent Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. Heller (which struck down the district's gun ban as unconstitutional) did "not invalidate this longstanding principle".[138] The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks.[140] On June 2, 2009, a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with Maloney v. Cuomo, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.[139]
In N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut (2004),[141] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues’ decision to uphold a series of strip searches of "troubled adolescent girls" in juvenile detention centers. While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due to "the severely intrusive nature of strip searches",[141] they should not be allowed "in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime".[141] She argued that an "individualized suspicion" rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than the majority's rule.[141]
In Leventhal v. Knapek (2001),[142] Sotomayor rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge by a U.S. Department of Transportation employee whose employer searched his office computer. She held that, "Even though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights"[142] because here "there were reasonable grounds to believe" that the search would reveal evidence of "work-related misconduct".[142]
In 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in Swedenburg v. Kelly that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as Swedenburg v. Kelly and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.[143]
Sotomayor was involved in the high-profile case Ricci v. DeStefano that initially upheld the right of the City of New Haven to throw out its test for firefighters and start over with a new test, because the City believed the test had a "disparate impact"[144] on minority firefighters. (No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The City was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The City chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the City's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put much extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned summary order (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.[145] Sotomayor's former mentor José A. Cabranes, by now a fellow judge on the court, objected to this handling and requested that the court hear it en banc.[146] Sotomayor voted with a 7–6 majority not to rehear it and a slightly expanded ruling was issued, but a strong dissent by Cabranes led to the case reaching the Supreme Court in 2009.[146] There it was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the white firefighters had been victims of racial discrimination when they were denied promotion.[147]
In Clarett v. National Football League (2004),[148] Sotomayor upheld the National Football League's eligibility rules requiring players to wait three full seasons after high school graduation before entering the NFL draft. Maurice Clarett challenged these rules, which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players, on antitrust grounds. Sotomayor held that Clarett's claim would upset the established "federal labor law favoring and governing the collective bargaining process".[149]
In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit (2005),[150] Sotomayor wrote a unanimous opinion that the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement to buy or sell stocks.[107] The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.[107]
In Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp. (2001),[151] she ruled that the license agreement of Netscape's Smart Download software did not constitute a binding contract because the system didn't give "sufficient notice" to the user.[152]
In Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko (2000),[153] Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that an existing Supreme Court doctrine, known as "Bivens"—which allows suits against individuals working for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the Bivens doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling.
In Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education (1999),[154] the parents of a black student alleged that he had been harassed due to his race and had been discriminated against when he was transferred from a first grade class to a kindergarten class without parental consent, while similarly situated white students were treated differently. Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was "contrary to the school's established policies" as well as its treatment of white students, which "supports the inference that race discrimination played a role".
In Krimstock v. Kelly (2002),[155] Sotomayor wrote an opinion halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding those vehicles for "months or even years" during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the City's continued possession of their property.
In Brody v. Village of Port Chester (2003 and 2005),[156] a takings case, Sotomayor first ruled in 2003 for a unanimous panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York was permitted to challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.[157]
In Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006),[158] an unrelated case brought about by the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.[159][160]
President Barack Obama meets with Judge Sonia Sotomayor and Vice President Joseph Biden prior to an announcement in the East Room, May 26, 2009
Since President Barack Obama's election there was speculation that Sotomayor could be a leading candidate for a Supreme Court seat.[71][108][109][161][162] New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during his term.[163] The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, about the possibility of her nomination.[164] On April 30, 2009, Justice David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in June 2009.[165] On May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, "I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally."[166] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[167] She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.[168]
Sotomayor's nomination won praise from Democrats and liberals, and Democrats appeared to have sufficient votes to confirm her.[169] The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in some form in a number of her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture:[123][169] "I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."[15] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention.[170][171] The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a "racist" (although the latter later backtracked from that claim),[172] while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling.[173][174] Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark,[175] and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been "poor".[173] Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, "ultimately and completely" a judge follows the law regardless of personal background.[176] Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in Ricci v. DeStefano received the most attention during the early nomination discussion,[177] and in the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29.[147] Some of the fervor with which conservatives and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.[178]
A Gallup poll released a week after the nomination showed 54 percent of Americans in favor of Sotomayor's confirmation compared with 28 percent in opposition.[179] A June 12 Fox News poll showed 58 percent of the public disagreeing with her "wise Latina" remark but 67 percent saying the remark should not disqualify her from serving on the Supreme Court.[180] The American Bar Association gave her a unanimous "well qualified" assessment, its highest mark for professional qualification.[100] Following the Ricci overruling, Rasmussen Reports and CNN/Opinion Research polls showed that the public was now sharply divided, largely along partisan and ideological lines, as to whether Sotomayor should be confirmed.[181][182]
Sotomayor's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, during which she backed away from her "wise Latina" remark, declaring it "a rhetorical flourish that fell flat" and stating that "I do not believe that any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment."[183][184] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions.[185] Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings – where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation – might be more reflective of her speeches.[186][187] Sotomayor defended her position in Ricci as following applicable precedent.[183] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.[188] In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law.[189] On July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sotomayor's nomination; the 13–6 vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and only one Republican supporting her.[190] On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31.[191] The vote was largely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and nine Republicans supporting her.[192] (A year later, Obama's second court pick, Elena Kagan, won confirmation by a 63–37 vote.[193])
President Obama commissioned Sotomayor on the day of her confirmation;[194] Sotomayor was sworn in on August 8, 2009, by Chief Justice John Roberts.[195] Sotomayor is the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court.[191][192][196] (Some attention has been given to Justice Benjamin Cardozo – a Sephardic Jew believed to be of distant Portuguese descent – as the first Hispanic on the court when appointed in 1932, but his roots were uncertain, the term "Hispanic" was not in use as an ethnic identifier at the time, and the Portuguese are generally excluded from its meaning.[197][198][199]) Sotomayor is also the third woman to serve on the Court, following Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her appointment gives the Court a record six Roman Catholic justices serving at the same time.[30]
The four women who have served on the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan
Sotomayor cast her first vote as an associate Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case.[200] She was given a warm welcome onto the Court[201] and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony.[202] Sotomayor heard arguments in her first case on September 9 during a special session. The case, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, involved the First Amendment rights of corporations in campaign finance[203] and became one of the most controversial and consequential decisions in a number of years, and one in which Sotomayor dissented.[204][205] Her first major written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights.[204][206]
As her first year neared completion, Sotomayor said it had been exciting, challenging and a little scary;[207] she told friends she felt swamped by the intensity and heavy workload of the job.[206] In succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor had done little to change the philosophical balance of the Court.[204][205][206] Sotomayor voted with Justices Ginsburg and Breyer 90 percent of the time, one of the highest agreement rates on the Court.[204][208]
In two very high-profile June 2012 decisions at the end of her third term, Sotomayor was part of a 5–3 majority in Arizona v. United States that struck down several aspects of the Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law,[209] and in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius was part of a landmark 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). While many cases are decided unanimously or with different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.[210]
On January 20 and 21, 2013, she administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[211] Later in 2013, her unjoined concurrence in the prior year's United States v. Jones decision, in which she said that in the digital age, "It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties," was cited by federal judge Richard Leon in his ruling that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment.[212] Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among those who said that Sotomayor's Jones concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, "in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks."[212]
By the end of her fifth year on the court, Sotomayor had become especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race or ethnic identity.[213]
Sotomayor was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007.[214] There she taught trial and appellate advocacy as well as a federal appellate court seminar.[214] She has been a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School since 1999, a paying, adjunct faculty position.[80][215] There she created and has co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship every semester since 2000; it combines classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work.[215] She became a member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011.[44][216] In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove.[217] On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.[218]
Sotomayor has maintained a public presence since joining the federal judiciary.[219] She has given over 180 speeches since 1993, about half of which either focused on issues of ethnicity or gender or were delivered to minority or women's groups.[219] Her speeches have tended to give a more defined picture of her worldview than her rulings on the bench.[164] The themes of her speeches have often focused on ethnic identity and experience, the need for diversity, and America's struggle with the implications of its diverse makeup.[164] She has also presented her career achievements as an example of the success of affirmative action policies in university admissions, saying "I am the perfect affirmative action baby" in regard to her belief that her admission test scores were not comparable to those of her classmates.[220][221] During 2012, Sotomayor made two appearances as herself on the children's television program Sesame Street, explaining what a career is and demonstrating how a judge hears a case.[222][223]
Sotomayor long lived in Greenwich Village in New York City and had few financial assets other than her home.[164] She enjoys shopping, traveling, and giving gifts and helps support her mother and her mother's husband in Florida.[224] Regarding her short financial disclosure reports, she has said, "When you don't have money, it's easy. There isn't anything there to report."[128] As a federal judge, she is entitled to a pension equal to her full salary upon retirement.[224] Upon joining the Supreme Court, she took up residence in Washington but sorely missed the faster-paced life of New York.[55] After renting in the Cleveland Park neighborhood for three years, in 2012 she purchased a condominium in the U Street Corridor.[225] She said, "I picked [that area] because it's mixed. I walk out and I see all kinds of people, which is the environment I grew up in and the environment I love."[55]
She takes several daily insulin injections,[226] and her diabetes is considered to be well controlled.[227] Sotomayor does not belong to a Catholic parish or attend Mass, but does attend church for important occasions.[30] She has said, "I am a very spiritual person [though] maybe not traditionally religious in terms of Sunday Mass every week, that sort of thing. The trappings are not important to me, but, yes, I do believe in God. And, yes, I do believe in the commandments."[55]
She maintains ties with Puerto Rico, visiting once or twice a year, speaking there occasionally, and visiting cousins and other relatives who still live in the Mayagüez area.[9][10][13] She has long stressed her ethnic identity, saying in 1996, "Although I am an American, love my country and could achieve its opportunity of succeeding at anything I worked for, I also have a Latina soul and heart, with the magic that carries."[23]
Sotomayor said of the years following her divorce, that "I have found it difficult to maintain a relationship while I've pursued my career."[64] She has talked of herself as "emotionally withdrawn" and lacking "genuine happiness" when living by herself; after becoming a judge, she said she would not date lawyers.[62] In 1997, she was engaged to New York construction contractor Peter White, but the relationship had ended by 2000.[8][62]
In July 2010, Sotomayor signed a contract with Alfred A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life.[228] She received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work,[229] which was published in January 2013 and titled My Beloved World[55] (Mi mundo adorado in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life up to 1992, with recollections of growing up in housing projects in New York and descriptions of the challenges she faced.[55] It received good reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times describing it as "a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. ... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication."[230] She staged a book tour to promote the work,[231] and it debuted atop the New York Times Best Seller List.[232]
On December 31, 2013, Sotomayor pressed the ceremonial button and lead the final 60-second countdown at the Times Square New Year's Eve ball drop, being the first United States Supreme Court justice to perform the task.[233][234]
Sotomayor has received honorary law degrees from Lehman College (1999),[98] Princeton University (2001),[98] Brooklyn Law School (2001),[98] Pace University School of Law (2003),[235] Hofstra University (2006),[80] Northeastern University School of Law (2007),[236] Howard University (2010),[207] St. Lawrence University (2010),[237] New York University (2012),[238]Yale University (2013),[239] and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).[240]
She was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2002.[241] She was given the Outstanding Latino Professional Award in 2006 by the Latino/a Law Students Association.[242]
In June 2010, the Bronxdale Houses development, where Sotomayor grew up, was renamed after her. The Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Justice Sonia Sotomayor Community Center comprise 28 buildings with some 3,500 residents. While many New York housing developments are named after well-known people, this was only the second to be named after a former resident.[243] In 2011, the Sonia M. Sotomayor Learning Academies, a public high school complex in Los Angeles, was named after her.[244]

                           I do believe that every person has an equal opportunity to be a good and wise judge, regardless of their background or life experiences.  Sonia Sotomayor
Sotomayor gets sworn in to the US Supreme CourtSonia Sotomayor is known for being the first Hispanic justice nominee on the United States Supreme Court. She is recognized as a somewhat controversial and outspoken candidate whose words are sometimes misinterpreted yet she is distinguished for her many years of judicial service. In 2009, she became the Courts 111th Justice, the first Hispanic Justice and third woman to serve in the US Supreme Court. 
Through her hard work and dedication, Sotomayor has become a role model to follow for all those Hispanics that are trying to get an education and a great career. For Sotomayor, it did not come easy, but she made success a necessity not an option. She is living proof of the American Dream. 
Sonia Sotomayor was born on June 25th 1954, in the Bronx, New York in a public housing project. Her parents, Juan and Celina Sotomayor were Puerto Ricans that came to New York during World War II. Her father was a tool and die maker with a third grade education and did not speak English. Her mother served in the Womens Auxiliary Corps during the war then became a nurse. She raised Sonia and her younger brother Juan, who is now a physician in Syracuse, New York. 
Sonia had a rough childhood, facing various obstacles. She was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes (Type I) when she was eight years old. Then her father died when she was nine years of age and her mother was left alone to raise her and her brother Juan. She spoke mostly Spanish up until the death of her father and turned to reading as a consolation. She fell in love with Nancy Drew, a detective in the popular childrens mystery series, which inspired a love of reading and learning. It was from these books that ultimately sparked her interest in the law even though she was told that her diabetes would not allow her to follow that line of work. 
Sonia Sotomayor at age 8Sotomayor mentioned that another fictional character was who inspired her to the next choice she made. 
"I noticed that [defense attorney] Perry Mason was involved in a lot of the same kinds of investigative work that I had been fascinated with reading Nancy Drew, so I decided to become a lawyer," Sotomayor told the American Bar Association publication in 2000. "Once I focused on becoming a lawyer, I never deviated from that goal." 
Her mom, Celina Sotomayor, sent both her and her brother to private Catholic schools. It was her mother who, since an early age, made Sonia and Juan believe in the power of education. It was her tremendous work ethic and her valiant effort to battle juvenile diabetes that helped Sotomayor excel on school. She was valedictorian of her class at Blessed Sacrament and at Cardinal Spellman High School in New York. 
She went on to Princeton University where she graduated 1976 as a summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, as well as being the co-recipient of the M. Taylor Pyne Prize, which is the highest honor Princeton awards to an undergraduate. She then earned her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was the editor of the Yale Law Journal and as managing editor of the Yale Studies in World Public Order. 
On the cover of Time MagazineOne of her Yale Law School classmates, Robert Klonoff described Judge Sotomayors intellectual toughness by saying, "She would stand up for herself and not be intimidated by anyone." [Washington Post, 5/7/09]  
Sotomayor has worked at almost every level in the judicial system over a span of three decades. In 1979, fresh out of Yale Law School, Sotomayor became an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan in 1979 where she tried many criminal cases over a span of five years and spent almost every day in the courtroom. She entered private practice in 1984 and became a partner in 1988 at the firm Pavia and Harcourt. 
Her judicial service began in October 1992 when President George H.W. Bush appointed her to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. From 1992-1998 she presided around 450 cases in which she earned a reputation as a sharp and fearless jurist who does not let powerful interests bully her into departing from the rule of law. 
President William H. Clinton appointed Judge Sotomayor to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1998. She also served as an adjunct professor at the NYU School of Law in 1998 and a lecturer at Columbia Law School in 1999. 
Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor (washingtonindependent.com)With all her achievements and recognitions, Sotomayor has also been highly criticized and had the majority of Senate Republicans oppose her nomination for Supreme Court Justice. She was under close observation and was attacked by critics for when she remarked, Personal experiences and gender have a lot to do with judges decisions. She was also, at one point, criticized for being racist when she made the comment saying, I would hope a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasnt lived that life.
But that belief she has sustained throughout her life is what has allowed her to be where she is today. She has always been true to her word and has defended what she thinks is right. As many people have agreed with her, Personal experiences affect what judges choose to see, and there is nothing wrong with that because it allows for a fair decision. 
Sotomayors personality not only made her liked and respected in the courtroom, but by the people that surrounded her as well. Robin Kar, who was a clerk for Sotomayor from 1998 to 1999, described her as a "warm, extraordinarily kind and caring person." 
Sotomayor with President Obama and Vice-President Biden (gettyimages)Kar remarked, "She has an amazing story, but she's also just an amazing person." He also added that she has the ability to get to know all of the people around her. "She was the judge who, in the courthouse for example, knew all of the doormen, knew the cafeteria workers, who knew the janitors -- she didn't just know all of the other judges and the politicians. She really went out of her way to get to know everyone and was well loved by everyone," which truly shows the kind of person Sotomayor is. 
Sonia Sotomayors humility is another great trademark of hers. She mentions, I stand on the shoulders of countless people, yet there is one extraordinary person who is my life aspiration - that person is my mother, Celina Sotomayor. To us, Sotomayor is a one of a kind hero, but to Sonia, her mother is the true hero. She taught her that hard-working mentality and led her to everything she has accomplished. Celina now lives in Florida and she still speaks with her everyday. 
On May 26th 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court Justice. After controversial hearings, Sotomayor became the first Hispanic Justice and third woman on the U.S. Supreme Court. Through hard work and dedication, she has accomplished everything she has set out to do. She has demonstrated that as long as you put your mind to something, you can do it! She is a perfect role model and a prime example that anything is possible. She is a great representative of the Hispanic community and for that we consider her our hero!

The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court sit for their official photograph on October 8, 2010, at the Supreme Court. Front row, from left: Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Back row, from left: Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito Jr. and Elena Kagan.
In 2005, Chief Justice John G. Roberts was nominated by President George W. Bush to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as an associate justice. After Chief Justice William Rehnquist died, however, Bush named Roberts to the chief justice post. The court has moved to the right during his tenure, although Roberts supplied the key vote to uphold President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.
Justice Antonin Scalia was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to fill the seat vacated by Justice William Rehnquist when he was elevated to chief justice. A constitutional originalist -- and a colorful orator -- Scalia is a member of the court's conservative wing. He is currently the court's longest-serving justice.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. He is a conservative justice but has provided crucial swing votes in many cases, writing the majority opinion, for example, in Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down that state's sodomy law. 
Justice Clarence Thomas is the second African-American to serve on the court, succeeding Justice Thurgood Marshall when he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991. He is a conservative, a strict constructionist who supports states' rights.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, she is a strong voice in the court's liberal minority.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer was appointed to the court in 1994 by President Bill Clinton. He is considered a member of the court's liberal minority.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006 and is known as one of the most conservative justices to serve on the court in modern times.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor is the court's first Hispanic and third female justice. She was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 and is regarded as a resolutely liberal member of the court.
Justice Elena Kagan is the fourth female justice and a member of the court's liberal wing. She was appointed in 2010, at the age of 50, by President Barack Obama and is the court's youngest member.
Sotomayor's parents moved from Puerto Rico to New York in the 1940s. Her father died when she was nine.
1992-1998 - Associate judge at the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, nominated by President George H.W. Bush.
April 1995 - Sotomayor issues an injunction which ends the eight-month long Major League Baseball strike.
June 25, 1997 - President Bill Clinton nominates Sotomayor to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
October 2, 1998 - Sotomayor is confirmed by the Senate after Republican opposition delays the vote for more than a year.
May 26, 2009 - Is nominated by President Barack Obama to replace Justice David Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court.
August 6, 2009 - Sotomayor is confirmed by the U.S. Senate (68 - 31). She becomes the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.
August 8, 2009 - Sotomayor is sworn in as the 111th Justice of the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Roberts.
June 4, 2010 - The Bronxdale Houses public housing project she grew up in is renamed the Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Community Center.
July 12, 2010 - Commits to write and publish her memoir with Alfred A. Knopf. It is later revealed that Sotomayor received a $1.175 million advance, according to financial disclosure forms released in 2011.
January 15, 2013 - Sotomayor releases her memoir "My Beloved World," which discusses her father's alcoholism, her struggle with diabetes and her divorce.

  Who is Sonia Sotomayor?Story Highlights Sotomayor: "I am an ordinary person ... blessed with extraordinary opportunities"  Sonia Sotomayor, 54, was born in Bronx to parents from Puerto Rico  Supreme Court nominee grew up in a public housing project in the South Bronx  Named district judge by George H.W. Bush; elevated to current seat by Bill Clinton  Next Article in Politics »  Read VIDEO PHOTOSGALLERYBACKGROUND   
 As a child, she aspired to be like Nancy Drew, the detective in the popular children's mystery series. But at the age of 8, she was diagnosed with diabetes and told she would not be able to pursue that line of work. Sotomayor said it was another fictional character that inspired her next choice.   "I noticed that [defense attorney] Perry Mason was involved in a lot of the same kinds of investigative work that I had been fascinated with reading Nancy Drew, so I decided to become a lawyer," Sotomayor told the American Bar Association publication in 2000. "Once I focused on becoming a lawyer, I never deviated from that goal."  See Sotomayor's life in photos » Sotomayor's parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II. Her father worked in a factory and didn't speak English.   She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project, not too far from the stadium of her favorite team -- the New York Yankees. Her father died when she was 9, leaving her mother to raise her and her younger brother on her own. Related: Sotomayor well known in sports    Her mother, whom Sotomayor describes as her biggest inspiration, worked six days a week to care for her and her younger brother, and instilled in them the value of an education.  Background on Sotomayor » Sotomayor later graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and went on to attend Yale law school, where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal.  
   In her three-decade career, she has worked at nearly every level of the judicial system, and on Tuesday she became President Obama's pick to replace retiring Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court.  Watch Sotomayor accept the nomination » Sotomayor thanked Obama for "the most humbling honor of my life." "I hope that as the Senate and American people learn more about me, they will see that I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences. Today is one of those experiences," she said.   The 54-year-old judge, if confirmed, would become the first Hispanic to serve on the high court. She would also be the third female named to the Supreme Court, and the second on the current court.  See who's already on the Supreme Court » Sotomayor is touted by supporters as a justice with bipartisan favor and historic appeal. She currently serves as a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The liberal-leaning justice was named a district judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and was elevated to her current seat by President Clinton.  Supporters say her appointment history, along with what they describe as her moderate-liberal views, will give her some bipartisan backing in the Senate.   Sotomayor presided over about 450 cases while on the district court. Prior to her judicial appointments, Sotomayor was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes.    Robin Kar, who clerked for Sotomayor from 1998 to 1999, described her as a "warm, extraordinarily kind and caring person."  Watch Kar recall his work with Sotomayor » "She has an amazing story, but she's also just an amazing person," he said, adding that she has a knack for getting to know those around her. "She was the judge who, in the courthouse for example, knew all of the doormen, knew the cafeteria workers, who knew the janitors -- she didn't just know all of the other judges and the politicians. She really went out of her way to get to know everyone and was well loved by everyone." Conservatives argue Sotomayor has a "hard-left record" and believes that judges should consider experiences of women and minorities in their decision-making. They also described her as a "bully" who "abuses lawyers." Asked about allegations that she tends to be prickly with her colleagues, Kar said, "I would say no to that. What I would say is that she has a reputation for being prickly on the bench, which is a bit different." Kar said if attorneys have with a weak argument, "she's very quick ... and intellectually demanding." "They'll have a hard time if they show up in her court without really doing their homework," he said.  Margarita Rosa, a Princeton classmate of Sotomayor, said she's always known the high court nominee to be "measured and methodical" in her decision-making. "She really looks at the facts and she is, I think, very evenhanded and fair -- but does bring to the table a very valuable understanding of the challenges and experiences, I think, of average people," she said. Obama has said he hopes confirmation hearings will be held in July, with the confirmation completed before Congress leaves for the summer.  Sotomayor was confirmed to her current seat by the Senate in 1998, a process that took more than a year. The final vote was 67-29. Though a majority of Senate Republicans opposed her nomination, she did win several key Republican votes that year, which could prove critical in this year's confirmation fight. 
 In 1998, the New York judge won the support of 25 Republicans, including eight senators who still serve. If Sotomayor is able to maintain the support of just a few of those GOP senators this year, Senate Republicans would face an almost impossible task in defeating her nomination, even by filibuster, which requires 40 votes. Currently, Republicans hold 39 senate seats. All 29 votes against her 1998 nomination were from Republicans, 11 of whom still serve.

Sonia Sotomayor is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She was the first nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States by President Barack Obama.
On Tuesday, May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill the seat of the retiring David Souter. Judge Sotomayor was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 6, 2009 on a super majority 68-31 vote.[1][2]
Sotomayor is only the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court (after O'Connor and Ginsburg) and one of three current female Justices. Sotomayor has the distinction of serving as the first Hispanic Justice. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted in favor of her confirmation on July 28, 2009 in a 13-6 vote with one Republican, Senator Lindsey Graham, voting in favor.[3][4]
Sotomayor has been described as both outspoken and "quite brash" on the bench characteristics that could help her carve out a place on the nation's highest court.[5][6]
Sotomayor's confirmation hearings were considered to be something of a formality as Democrats had enough votes to circumvent any Republican attempts to block her confirmation.[7][8]
Sonia Sotomayor was born on June 25, 1954 in the Bronx borough of New York City, New York and both of her parents were born in Puerto Rico.[9][6][10]
Sotomayor graduated valedictorian from Cardinal Spellman High School, a private Catholic school in New York City in 1972.[11] At the time of her confirmation, Sotomayor was the sixth sitting Catholic on the court, alongside Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.[12][13]
Sotomayor graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a bachelor's degree in History in 1976. While at Princeton, she received the M. Taylor Pyne Honor Prize.[14][15] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis on "The Impact of the Life of Luis Munoz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto Rico, 1930-1975."[16][17]
Upon graduating Princeton University, Sotomayor would attend Yale Law School, where she was awarded her Juris Doctor degree in 1979.[18]  She co-chaired the Latin American and Native American Students Association and was published in the Yale Law Journal (where she served as an editor) with the note "Statehood and the Equal Footing Doctrine: The Case for Puerto Rican Seabed Rights" which, as the title suggests, analyzed issues regarding Puerto Rico's ability to maintain rights to its seabed if it pursued statehood.[19][20][6]
Sotomayor joined the office of Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau in 1979. She served as an Assistant District Attorney from 1979 until entering private practice in 1984. One of Sotomayor's former colleagues said, "I think she wanted to make sure that her cases were solid and that she was dispensing justice before just locking someone up or putting them away, as opposed to being an overzealous prosecutor who believed that if you were arrested you were automatically guilty.[21][22]
In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during Sotomayor's  Supreme Court confirmation hearings, New York County District Attorney Morgenthau recounted Assistant District Attorney Sotomayor's time in his office.[23]
 ...one of the brightest and most mature, hard-working, standout who was marked for rapid advancement.[23] [24]
 Assistant District Attorney Sotomayor soon developed a reputation. Unlike many prosecutors, she simply would not be pushed around by judges or by attorneys. Some judges were eager to dispose of cases cheaply to clear their calendars. ADA Sotomayor instead fought for the right conclusion in each case.[23] [24]
In 1984, Sotomayor left Morgenthau's office to enter private practice. She would spend the next eight years (1984-1992) as a civil attorney with the New York City law firm of Pavia & Harcourt. From April 1984 to December 1987, Sotomayor was an associate with the firm, making partner in 1988.[27]
During her time in private practice, Sotomayor would also run a solo practice, Sotomayor & Associates, out of her Brooklyn apartment from 1983 to 1986. This did, in fact, overlap her time as an assistant district attorney by approximately one year. Little is know about Sotomayor & Associates other than what the judge herself answered in her Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire.[27][[ According to Sotomayor, the practice was an outlet to help "family and friends in their real estate, business and estate planning decisions."[28] Some questions were raised about Sotomayor's solo practice, such as: why she added the "& Associates" when she was practicing solo, why she never registered the business, whether or not she was compensated for her services while also drawing a check from New York County and the exact time frame of the practice, but there is no evidence that she did anything illegal or technically unethical.[28]
Sotomayor's private practice years would mark her last as an attorney as she joined the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as a federal district judge in 1992.[18]
Sonia Sotomayor served as a judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York from 1992 until rising to the bench of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1998.
On the recommendation of U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Sotomayor was nominated to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H.W. Bush on November 27, 1991 to a seat vacated by John Walker.
Her appointment was held up for nearly a year under the 'anonymous hold' loophole in the Senate confirmation process despite approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee and a "Qualified" rating by the American Bar Association.[29][30] Sotomayor was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 11, 1992 with the unanimous consent of the Senate, receiving her commission on August 12, 1992. When she joined the court, she was its youngest judge.[31]
As a federal district judge, Sotomayor did not hear many controversial cases and kept a regularly low profile with regard to constitutional issues. She did gain notoriety after several high profile rulings regarding the Major League Baseball strike of 1994, the Wall Street Journal's publishing of the controversial "suicide note" left by former Clinton White House counsel Vince Foster and copyright issues related to a trivia book about the television show Seinfeld. As a federal district judge, Sotomayor had one of her decisions overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States.

Carol Publishing Group] 150 F.3d 132 (1998)Judge Sotomayor ruled (and was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that SAT: The Seinfeld Aptitude Test infringed on the copyright of the television show Seinfeld. The case is often used in law schools as a modern application of the fair use doctrine.[32][33]

Sotomayor's decision was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and that reversal was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 7-2 vote (Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer dissenting).[34][35][36]
  • Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc. (1995)  Judge(s):Sonia Sotomayor     *[ Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc] 67 F3d 1054 (1995)Judge Sotomayor's decision to grant a temporary injunction against the Major League Baseball owners on March 31, 1995 ended the 232-day baseball strike of 1994. The injunction prevented the owners from installing replacement players and temporarily reinstated a five-year-old collective bargaining agreement allowing the 1995 season to take place and allowing players and owners to come to a new agreement nearly a year later. Her decision was later upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.[37][38][39][40][34][41]
  • Dow Jones v. U.S. Department of Justice (1995)  Judge(s):Sonia Sotomayor     *[ Dow Jones v. U.S. Department of Justice] 880F. Supp. 145 (1995)In 1995, Judge Sotomayor ruled in favor of the Wall Street Journal allowing them to print a photocopy of the final note written by Clinton White House deputy counsel Vince Foster who died in 1993. While the death of Vince Foster was ruled a suicide, it remains a mystery to many and a source of many conspiracy theories. As a result, Sotomayor ruled that the "substantial" public interest in the Foster story outweighed any violation of his family's privacy.[42][43][44]
Sonia Sotomayor served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1998 until her confirmation as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in 2009.
On the recommendation of U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Sotomayor was nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  by President Bill Clinton on June 25, 1997 to a seat vacated by Daniel Mahoney. Again, Sotomayor fell victim to politics when her appointment was held up for nearly six months after a March 1998 approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee as Republicans were concerned she would be President Clinton's choice as a Supreme Court Justice.[45] Sotomayor was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 2, 1998 on a super majority 67-29-2 vote, receiving her commission on October 7, 1998.[46]
A substantial majority of judicial evaluators at the American Bar Association ranked Sotomayor in 1997 as "well qualified" for a position on the federal appellate bench, while a minority of evaluators found her "qualified."[47]
In filling out her Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire, Sotomayor wrote that "judges must be extraordinarily sensitive to the impact of their decisions and function within, and respectful of, the Constitution."[22]

During more than a decade as a circuit court judge, Sotomayor has heard appeals on more than 3,000 cases and wrote in excess of 380 opinions for the majority. She had six of those decisions reviewed by the United States Supreme Court with four of them overturned and two upheld. Studies find her judgeship to have been moderate with respect to political leanings. A study of her 226 majority opinions from 2001 to 2009 found that 38% of her opinions could be clearly defined as liberal in nature with 49% of them falling clearly on the conservative end of the spectrum. She tends to be more conservative in criminal cases and tends to be more liberal in her dissenting opinions according to studies.[48][22]
  • Ricci v. DeStefano (2008)  Judge(s):Sonia Sotomayor     *[ Ricci v. DeStefano] 530 F.3d 87 (2008)In what is considered to be the judge's most high-profile case, Sotomayor joined a finding in favor of the city of New Haven rejecting a lawsuit filed by 17 white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter claiming race discrimination when the city of New Haven denied promotions following a promotion examination that yielded no black candidates eligible for advancement. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the decision stating the decision to cancel the promotions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which guarantees equal employment opportunity. The Court found that Sotomayor's ruling would allow the city to "experiment" with tests until they found one that produced "a more desirable racial distribution."[49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][6][58][59][60]
  • Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency (2007)  Judge(s):Sonia Sotomayor     *[ Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency] 475 F3d 83 (2007)Sotomayor found in favor of environmental group Riverkeeper who challenged an EPA ruling on the Clean Water Act's "best technology" rule involving power plants need to intake water as weighed against the risk to aquatic life in surrounding waters. In her ruling, she held "Congress has already specified the relationship between cost and benefits in requiring that the technology designated by EPA be the best available." Sotomayor's decision was overturned by the United States Supreme Court in a 6-3 vote where the Court held that EPA could not weigh the costs of changes to power plants versus the value of organisms in dollar terms, but could consider only what costs "may reasonably be borne" by power plants when determining the best technology rule available.[61][56][50]
  • Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush (2002)  Judge(s):Sonia Sotomayor     *[ Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush] 304 F3d 183 (2002)In a case involving the conservative Mexico City Policy - announced by Ronald Reagan in 1984 and subsequently rescinded by President Bill Clinton and reauthorized by President George W. Bush, Sotomayor found that the federal government is within its rights to deny federal aid to foreign organizations that support or perform abortions. She dismissed claims by the pro-choice Center for Reproductive Law and Policy that the Mexico City Policy violated the First Amendment right to association as well as Fifth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection. In her finding, Sotomayor cited the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 which authorizes the President "to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for voluntary population planning" as well as multiple  Supreme Court precedents. In her decision, Sotomayor wrote, "the  Supreme Court has made clear that the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds."[62][63][6]
  • Malesko v. Correctional Services Corporation (2000)  Judge(s):Sonia Sotomayor     *[ Malesko v. Correctional Services Corporation] 229 F3d 374 (2000)In this case, Sotomayor found that an inmate living in a halfway house could sue a government contractor for forcing him to climb five flights of stairs despite a heart condition after the inmate suffered a heart attack, fell down the stairs and injured himself. Sotomayor held "extending Bivens liability to reach private corporations furthers [its] overriding purpose: providing redress for violations of constitutional rights." (Bivens was a 1971 Supreme Court case that allowed some people whose rights have been violated by federal agents to sue.) The Supreme Court overturned Sotomayor's decision in a 5 to 4 ruling stating that only individual agents, not corporations, could be sued for such violations.[64][56][50]
On Tuesday, May 26, 2009, President Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill the seat of Justice David Souter. Sotomayor was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 6, 2009 on a super majority 68-31 vote.[65][66][1][67]
Sotomayor's name had initially emerged as a potential Supreme Court nominee in early February 2009 when Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's diagnosis of early stage colon cancer was announced.[68] When David Souter announced his retirement, Sotomayor's name went from "a contender" to one of the names considered to clearly be on Obama's short list for a nomination.[69][6]
Sotomayor joining the Court was not expected to shift the ideological balance of power on the court, since she was considered a liberal jurist who was expected to fill the seat of another reliably liberal vote in David Souter.[6]
Her most high-profile and controversial ruling prior to her Supreme Court appointment was the affirmative action case Ricci v. DeStefano. For more on this ruling, see Notable cases on the Second Circuit. This ruling led some conservative Republicans in the United States Senate to label Sotomayor as a judicial activist.[6][50][70][71][56][72][59]
Interestingly, liberal groups expressed concerns of their own over Sotomayor's lack of strong rulings in support of liberal causes. Specifically, they have expressed concern over one ruling on abortion in Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush in which she ruled in favor of the Bush administration's right to deny federal aid to foreign organizations that support or provide abortions.[73][6]
Another ruling that liberals criticized was U.S. v. Falso, a child pornography case in which Sotomayor sided with police despite defense claims that Falso's Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the police did not have probable cause to search his home. Sotomayor applied a "good faith exception" noting that police had obtained a warrant based on prior bad acts and regular e-mails received from a child pornography website.[74][75]
As the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, Sotomayor made history with her confirmation on August 6, 2009. She is only the third woman to serve on the nation's highest court.[6][1][76]
Justice Sotomayor took the Constitutional and Judicial Oaths of Office on August 8, 2009, which were administered by Chief Justice John Roberts.[77]
In a political slip-of-the-tongue during a 2005 visit to Duke University, Sotomayor said that "a court of appeals is where policy is made." She was quick to qualify the remark when she said, "I know this is on tape, and I should never say that because we don't 'make law. OK. I know. I'm not promoting it. I'm not advocating it."[78] Sotomayor made it abundantly clear during her confirmation hearings that she did not want to be viewed as a judicial activist. In her opening statement, she declared her judicial philosophy to be "fidelity to the law." "The task of a judge is not to make law. It is to apply the law."[58]
In a 2003 lecture before a criminal law class at the University of Indiana School of Law, Sotomayor inadvertently defended the Bush Administration's right to hold enemy combatants to a different set of legal standards than American citizens. "So we have suspected enemy combatants detained in secret and given different process than criminals. One can certainly justify that type of detention under precedents and current law."[79] Sotomayor would go on to raise questions as to the limits of encroachment on the civil liberties of Americans in her speech, but she continued to limit her opinions to law and precedent.[80]
To read the whole speech, see: The New York Times, "Judge Sotomayor's 2003 Lecture at Indiana Law School".
In a 2001 speech at the University of California at Berkeley, Sotomayor acknowledged that a judge's gender and ethnic background "may and will make a difference in our judging." During her remarks, she said "Justice  O'Connor has often been cited as saying that a wise old man and a wise old woman will reach the same conclusion in deciding cases. I am also not sure that I agree with the statement ... I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."[81] Sotomayor's remarks came during a U.C. Berkeley School of Law symposium titled Raising the Bar: Latino and Latina Presence in the Judiciary and Struggles for Representation.[6][78][82][59]

 The first Hispanic and third woman appointed to the United States Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor has become an instant American icon. Now, with a candor and intimacy never undertaken by a sitting Justice, she recounts her life from a Bronx housing project to the federal bench, a journey that offers an inspiring testament to her own extraordinary determination and the power of believing in oneself.Here is the story of a precarious childhood, with an alcoholic father (who would die when she was nine) and a devoted but overburdened mother, and of the refuge a little girl took from the turmoil at home with her passionately spirited paternal grandmother. But it was when she was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes that the precocious Sonia recognized she must ultimately depend on herself.  She would learn to give herself the insulin shots she needed to survive and soon imagined a path to a different life. With only television characters for her professional role models, and little understanding of what was involved, she determined to become a lawyer, a dream that would sustain her on an unlikely course, from valedictorian of her high school class to the highest honors at Princeton, Yale Law School, the New York County District Attorney’s office, private practice, and appointment to the Federal District Court before the age of forty. Along the way we see how she was shaped by her invaluable mentors, a failed marriage, and the modern version of extended family she has created from cherished friends and their children. Through her still-astonished eyes, America’s infinite possibilities are envisioned anew in this warm and honest book, destined to become a classic of self-invention and self-discovery.

Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2013: Happily, it is becoming a familiar story: The young, smart, and very hardworking son or daughter of immigrants rises to the top of American professional life. But already knowing the arc of Sonia Sotomayor’s biography doesn’t adequately prepare you for the sound of her voice in this winning memoir that ends, interestingly, before the Yale Law School grad was sworn in as the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice. Hers is a voice that lands squarely between self-deprecating and proud, grateful and defiant; a voice lilted with bits of Puerto Rican poetry; a voice full of anger, sadness, ambition, and love. My Beloved World is one resonant, glorious tale of struggle and triumph. --Sara Nelson
       *Starred Review* When Sotomayor joined the U.S. Supreme Court in 2009, she made history as the first Hispanic on the high court. She’d also achieved the highest dream of a Puerto Rican girl growing up in a Bronx housing project longing to someday become a judge. In this amazingly candid memoir, Sotomayor recalls a tumultuous childhood: alcoholic father, emotionally distant mother, aggravating little brother, and a host of aunts, uncles, and cousins, all overseen by her loving, domineering paternal grandmother. When she was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at eight years of age, she knew she had to learn to give herself the insulin shots. That determination saw her through Catholic high school, Princeton, and Yale Law School, at each step struggling to reconcile the poverty of her childhood with the privileges she was beginning to enjoy. No rabble-rouser, she nonetheless was active in student groups supporting minorities. At Yale, she learned how to think about jurisprudence, but readers looking for clues to her judicial thinking will be disappointed as she deliberately demurs. She recounts complicated feelings toward her parents and her failed marriage as she advanced to the DA’s office, private practice, the district court, and, triumphantly, the Supreme Court. Sotomayor offers an intimate and honest look at her extraordinary life and the support and blessings that propelled her forward.       HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: A media blitz will attend the release of this already newsworthy memoir by the Supreme Court’s first Hispanic justice. --Vanessa Bush

  This book was very well written and is a very remarkable life story.sarah carterWhat I liked most is that she inspired young woman that they can achieve great success with hard work and perseverance.VIVIANThis is a fascinating look at the early life and coming-of-age story of Sonia Sotomayor, Supreme Court Justice.L. Diebert
  Full disclosure, I am a lawyer, so I have perhaps an above average interest in Sonia Sotomayor. Prior to reading this book, I did not know much about her, and I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn more. On the whole, I enjoyed this book. I was not a fan of the writing style. I suppose it was meant to be conversational, but I found it a bit stilted at times and overly formal. I find any reviews that this book is not heavy enough on Justice Sotomayor's legal doctrine laughable. One, it is a memoir. Two, she is clear in her preface that she will not be covering that topic. Three, the books stops when she is appointed to the federal bench in 1992. If you want to know a Supreme Court Justice's doctrine, read through their opinions, concurrences and dissents. Don't look to a memoir that focuses mostly on her coming of age and early years as an attorney.The book was engaging, and really demonstrates what hard work can accomplish. As she notes, she may not have been qualified when she made it to certain points in her life, but she worked her tail off to show that she was more than deserving, which can be seen by all types of objective achievements. I particularly enjoyed the sections of the book that discussed her work at the DA's office. If I had one major complaint, it would be that she was a tad bit too self-congratulatory. That could be my own stereotypes speaking, however! I have to push myself to decide whether I would feel the same way if she were a man. The fact is that she has accomplished more than most people can dream of, with far fewer tools. That can only come from intelligence, hard work and savvy, which she certainly should feel proud about. Good, quick read for anyone looking to learn more about Justice Sotomayor.
I did not quite know what to expect regarding this memoir by Justice Sotomayor of her pre-judicial life. As a student of the Court for 40 years or so, a lawyer for 35 years, and a trained political scientist, I have found judicial biographies and the few judicial memoirs highly insightful into the character and actions of particular Justices. Justice Sotomayor is certainly the least known of the current Court, at least to me, and I was pleasantly surprised how absolutely candid her book is. It tells one a great deal about her, her background, and her character. The only other candid and insightful memoir that compares with this one is Justice Thomas' "My Grandfather's Son," distinctive for its remarkable honesty and perspective on his thinking and the factors that shaped it. A number of her topics stand out:First, she affords the reader a remarkable perspective on affirmative action, which she readily admits touched upon her own life in terms of Princeton, Yale Law, and her selection as a U.S. District Judge. Her attitude is much more supportive of the concept than Thomas was in his sometimes angry discussion of the issue in his book. Sotomayor places emphasis upon affirmative action as providing an opportunity to work very hard, unbelievably hard, and to demonstrate what your true capabilities are. She discusses this concept several times at different stages of her book, and I am very appreciative for helping to develop my thinking on this important issue.Second, I found her story most fascinating because it is, in microcosm, the story of Puerto Rican challenges in Hispanic New York. I knew very little about this culture before reading the book.Read more ›
Memoirs today come out of a black hole, many of them tainted by allusions to fact later revealed to be the heady stuff of fiction.  It has happened so often the genre, it seems, doesn't know what it wants to be.  So it is refreshing right out of the box to run into the preface of Justice Sotomayor, who lays down her rules for writing...rules of engagement, as it were.  She takes as firm a stand as we are likely to read against blended characters, and a reader gets the impression there isn't going to be a recall of this book, a retraction, let alone a major scandal involving facts that turn out to be chimera.  Considering the disasters we've come to expect from memoir, it's a great start.I winced when the Justice gave herself an insulin injection on 60 Minutes; the incident repeats itself in the opening chapter, one that it reads more like a Dennis Lehane sequence, and the only thing keeping it from continuing on in this manner are the interjections, the lessons of a lived life, that every so often bubble up and infuse the text with didactic mannerisms.  But even with them, the text flows easily, readers are  engulfed in the lustrous prose because the language is steeped in verisimilitude with its seances, Abuelita and bisabuela, the neuropathy of a father bathed in alcoholism - the characters all alive, vivid, and brilliantly real.  At some moments, you could be in the magical world of Marquez, as in: "vines snaked under iron fences and up balustrades.  Chickens scrabbled under hibiscus bushes and bright yellow canario flowers.  I watched the afternoon rains pour down like a curtain...".  In other places, the regret of Joan Didion: "ballet class was a brief torture.Read more ›
      This was an excellent book  I very much enjoyed her writing style. She conveyed her story with rich language that was never overblown.
      Great book.  I love autobiographies.  Sonia is a very strong woman.  She overcame obstacles in her life and went on to succeed.  I had trouble putting the book down.
      This a story about a person overcoming great odds, not about politics.  A minority, living in public housing, with a single mom and being a diabetic.
      Absolutely loved this memoir.  It does almost read like a novel.Some of the details of lawyering drag it down the slightest bit, however,I learned so much about the...
      I am a physician but had no idea of the scope and breadth of the legal profession.  She is certainly an impressive individual and extremely capable.
      I did not expect such warm and wonderful prose that was completely down to earth. A really engaging read. Very little about politics or her current position.
      I believe that Ms. Sotomayor was and is a terrific choice for Supreme Court Justice.  However, this autobiography/memoir is a bit sentimental and pedestrian.
      Some of the ideas stated by Ms. Sotomayor on how to have a satisfying, fruitful life will stay with me forever.
      Excellent and riveting. Revelatory and personal. Of particular interest to lawyers. Does she tell too much? Give too much advice?  You decide.
      Her story was told with humility and conversationally. Our book club enjoyed reading about Sonia's upbringing and her path to the Supreme Court.
