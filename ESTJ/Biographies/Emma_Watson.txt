This article is about the actress.  For other people named Emma Watson, see Emma Watson (disambiguation).
Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson[3] (born 15 April 1990)[4] is an English actress and model. She rose to prominence playing Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series; she was cast as Hermione at the age of nine, having previously acted only in school plays.[4] She starred in all eight Harry Potter films, alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint.[5] Watson's work on the Harry Potter series has earned her several awards and more than £10 million.[6] She made her modelling debut for Burberry's autumn/winter campaign in 2009. In October 2013, she was voted Sexiest Female Movie Star in a worldwide poll conducted by Empire magazine.[7] In May 2014, BuzzFeed dubbed her the "most flawless woman of the decade".[8]
In 2007, Watson announced her involvement in The Tale of Despereaux and the television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes, which was broadcast on 26 December 2007 to an audience of 5.2 million. The Tale of Despereaux, based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo, was released in 2008 and grossed more than US$86 million in worldwide sales.[9] In 2012, she starred in Stephen Chbosky's film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and in 2014, she played Ila in Darren Aronofsky's biblical epic Noah.[10]
Watson was born in Paris, the daughter of British lawyers Jacqueline Luesby and Chris Watson.[11][12][13] Watson lived in Paris until the age of five. Her parents separated when she was young; following their divorce, she moved back to her mother's native country, England, to live in Oxfordshire, spending weekends at her father's house in London.[11][14] Watson has stated that she speaks some French, though "not as well" as she used to.[15]
After moving to Oxford with her mother and brother, Watson attended the Dragon School in Oxford, remaining there until 2003.[11] From the age of six, she wanted to become an actress,[16] and trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing, and acting.[17] By the age of ten, she had performed in various Stagecoach productions and school plays, including Arthur: The Young Years and The Happy Prince,[18] but she had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series. Following the Dragon School, Watson moved on to Headington School.[11] While on film sets, she and her peers were tutored for up to five hours a day.[19] In June 2006, she took GCSE school examinations in ten subjects, achieving eight A* and two A grades.[11][20]
In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States), the film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling's best-selling novel. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers were impressed by her confidence. After eight auditions, producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint that they had been cast for the roles of the schoolfriends Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen test.[16]
The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2001 was Watson's debut screen performance. The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001.[21][22] Critics praised the performances of the three leads, often singling out Watson for particular acclaim; The Daily Telegraph called her performance "admirable",[23] and IGN said she "stole the show".[24] Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in Philosopher's Stone, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress.[25]
A year later, Watson again starred as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers praised the lead actors' performances. The Los Angeles Times said Watson and her peers had matured between films,[26] while The Times criticised director Chris Columbus for "under-employing" Watson's hugely popular character.[27] Watson received an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo for her performance.[28]
In 2004, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. Watson was appreciative of the more assertive role Hermione played, calling her character "charismatic" and "a fantastic role to play".[29] Although critics panned Radcliffe's performance, labelling him "wooden", they praised Watson; The New York Times lauded her performance, saying "Luckily Mr. Radcliffe's blandness is offset by Ms. Watson's spiky impatience. Harry may show off his expanding wizardly skills ... but Hermione ... earns the loudest applause with a decidedly unmagical punch to Draco Malfoy's deserving nose."[30] Although Prisoner of Azkaban proved to be the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film of the entire series, Watson's personal performance won her two Otto Awards and the Child Performance of the Year award from Total Film.[31][32][33]
With Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), both Watson and the Harry Potter film series reached new milestones. The film set records for a Harry Potter opening weekend, a non-May opening weekend in the US, and an opening weekend in the UK. Critics praised the increasing maturity of Watson and her teenage co-stars; The New York Times called her performance "touchingly earnest".[34] For Watson, much of the humour of the film sprang from the tension among the three lead characters as they matured. She said, "I loved all the arguing. ... I think it's much more realistic that they would argue and that there would be problems."[35] Nominated for three awards for Goblet of Fire, Watson won a bronze Otto Award.[36][37][38] Later that year, Watson became the youngest person to appear on the cover of Teen Vogue,[39] an appearance she reprised in August 2009.[40] In 2006, Watson played Hermione in The Queen's Handbag, a special mini-episode of Harry Potter in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday.[41]
The fifth film in the Harry Potter franchise, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released in 2007. A huge financial success, the film set a record worldwide opening-weekend gross of $332.7 million.[42] Watson won the inaugural National Movie Award for Best Female Performance.[43] As the fame of the actress and the series continued, Watson and fellow Harry Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint left imprints of their hands, feet and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood on 9 July 2007.[44]
By July 2007, Watson's work in the Harry Potter series was said to have earned her more than £10 million, and she acknowledged she would never have to work for money again.[6] In March 2009, she was ranked 6th on the Forbes list of "Most Valuable Young Stars",[45] and in February 2010, she was named as Hollywood's highest paid female star, having earned an estimated £19 million in 2009.[46]
Despite the success of Order of the Phoenix, the future of the Harry Potter franchise became surrounded in doubt, as all three lead actors were hesitant to sign on to continue their roles for the final two episodes.[47] Radcliffe eventually signed for the final films on 2 March 2007,[47] but Watson was considerably more hesitant.[48] She explained that the decision was significant, as the films represented a further four-year commitment to the role, but eventually conceded that she "could never let [the role of] Hermione go",[49] signing for the role on 23 March 2007.[50]

Watson's first non-Potter role was the 2007 BBC film Ballet Shoes, an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Noel Streatfeild.[51][52] The film's director, Sandra Goldbacher, commented that Watson was "perfect" for the starring role of aspiring actress Pauline Fossil: "She has a piercing, delicate aura that makes you want to gaze and gaze at her."[53] Ballet Shoes was broadcast in the UK on Boxing Day 2007 to an audience of 5.7 million viewers, to mixed reviews.[54][55][56][57][58] Watson also lent her voice to the role of Princess Pea in the animated film The Tale of Despereaux, a children's comedy starring Matthew Broderick with Harry Potter co-star Robbie Coltrane (playing the character of Rubeus Hagrid) also starring in the film.[59]
Principal photography for the sixth film began in late 2007, with Watson's part being filmed from 18 December to 17 May 2008.[60][61] Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premiered on 15 July 2009,[62] having been delayed from November 2008.[63] With the lead actors now in their late teens, critics were increasingly willing to review them on the same level as the rest of the film's all-star cast, which the Los Angeles Times described as "a comprehensive guide to contemporary UK acting".[64] The Washington Post felt Watson to have given "[her] most charming performance to date",[65] while The Daily Telegraph described the lead actors as "newly liberated and energised, eager to give all they have to what's left of the series".[66] The Tale of Despereaux was released in December 2008 and grossed $87 million worldwide.[9] In December 2008, Watson stated she wanted to go to university after she completed the Potter series.[67]
Watson's filming for the final instalment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, began on 18 February 2009[68] and ended on 12 June 2010.[citation needed] For financial and scripting reasons, the original book was divided into two films which were shot consecutively.[69][70] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 was released in November 2010 while the second film was released in July 2011.
She also appeared in a music video for One Night Only, after meeting lead singer George Craig at the 2010 Winter/Summer Burberry advertising campaign. The video, "Say You Don't Want It", was screened on Channel 4 on 26 June 2010 and released on 16 August.[71] In her first post-Harry Potter film, Watson appeared in 2011's My Week with Marilyn as Lucy, a wardrobe assistant who has a few dates with the main character, Colin Clark.[72][73]
In May 2010, Watson was reported to be in talks to star in a film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower.[74] Filming began in summer 2011 and the film was released in September 2012.[75]
In The Bling Ring (2013), Watson stars as Nicki. The film is based on the real-life Bling Ring robberies, with Watson playing a fictionalised version of Alexis Neiers—a television personality who was one of seven teenagers involved in the robberies. While the film mostly received mixed reviews, critics gave almost unanimous praise for Watson's portrayal of Nicki in the film. Watson also had a supporting role in the apocalyptic comedy This Is the End (2013), where she played herself.
In June 2012, Watson was confirmed for the role of Ila in Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which began filming the following month, and was released in March 2014.[10] She has been in talks to star in Guillermo del Toro's version of Beauty and the Beast.[76][77] In March 2013, it was reported that Watson was in negotiations to star as the titular character in a live-action Disney adaptation of Cinderella. Kenneth Branagh was attached to direct the adaptation, while Cate Blanchett had reportedly agreed to play the evil stepmother. Watson was offered the role, but turned it down.[78]
Watson was attached in 2012 to the role of Emma Forrest in a film adaptation of her memoir Your Voice in My Head. At the time, Harry Potter director David Yates was attached. In a May 2013 interview, it appeared that Watson was no longer attached as the film's star. Stanley Tucci stated that the role would instead be played by Emily Blunt.[79] However, by September 2013, it was confirmed that Watson was once again involved in the production in the role of Forrest and that filming would begin in November that year with a new director, Francesca Gregorini.[80]
As of June 2013, Watson is set to work with Harry Potter producer David Heyman for her next film Queen of the Tearling, based on a yet-to-be-released book trilogy. She will lead the film as heroine Kelsea Glynn as well as being an executive producer.[81] Warner Bros. will distribute the film.[82]
It was reported in September 2013 that Watson would star in While We're Young, the film adaptation of Adena Halpern's 2010 novel 29, which focuses on a young-at-heart grandmother who would rather spend time with her granddaughter (Watson) than her daughter. The film will be directed by Stephen Chbosky, who Watson collaborated with on The Perks of Being a Wallflower.[83] In October 2013, she was chosen as the Woman of the Year by GQ.[84] Watson also has been cast opposite Ethan Hawke in thriller Regression. Alejandro Amenábar wrote and will direct the film, which will be released in 2015.[85]
In 2008, the British press reported that Watson was to replace Keira Knightley as the face of the fashion house Chanel, but this was denied by both parties.[86] In June 2009, following several months of rumours, Watson confirmed that she would be partnering with Burberry as the face of their Autumn/Winter 2009 campaign, for which she received an estimated six-figure fee.[87][88] She also appeared in Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign alongside her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and model Max Hurd.[89] In February 2011, Watson was awarded the Style Icon award from British Elle by Dame Vivienne Westwood.[90] Watson continued her involvement in fashion advertising when she announced she had been chosen as the face of Lancôme in March 2011.[91]
In September 2009, Watson announced her involvement with People Tree, a Fair Trade fashion brand.[92] Watson worked as a creative advisor for People Tree to create a spring line of clothing, which was released in February 2010;[92][93] the range featured styles inspired by southern France and London.[93][94] The collection, described by The Times as "very clever" despite their "quiet hope that [she] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle",[95] was widely publicised in magazines such as Teen Vogue,[96] Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration,[97] admitted that competition for the range was minimal,[95] but argued that "Fashion is a great way to empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity you can help people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in"; adding, "I think young people like me are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there."[95] Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in the release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.[98]
Watson has appeared six years consecutively in the 100 Sexiest Women list as chosen by readers of FHM, a men's magazine. She first appeared in the list in 2007, placing 98th.[99] Subsequent years saw her placed 33rd, 47th, 29th, 23rd and, in 2012, 64th.[100]
After leaving school, Watson took a gap year[101] to film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows beginning in February 2009,[70] but said she "definitely want[ed] to go to university".[67] The Providence Journal reported that Watson had confirmed that she had chosen Brown University, located in Providence, Rhode Island.[102] In March 2011, after 18 months at the university, Watson announced that she was deferring her course for "a semester or two."[103] Watson was a visitor student at Worcester College, Oxford for the 2011–12 academic year.[104] Watson told Ellen DeGeneres in March 2014 that she was "about to graduate" from Brown in May. She noted that it took five years to graduate instead of four because, due to her acting work, she "ended up taking two full semesters off".[105] On 25 May 2014, Watson graduated Brown with a bachelor's degree in English literature and released a cap-and-gown photo on her Twitter account.[106]
In 2013, Watson became certified to teach yoga and meditation. She told Elle Australia that an uncertain future meant finding "a way to always feel safe and at home within myself. Because I can never rely on a physical place."[107]
Emma Watson broke up with American Will Adamowicz, whom she met at Oxford in 2011, in the summer of 2013. She later began dating Oxford rugby player Matt Janney, whom she met at a varsity match in December.[108]

      She enrolled in a Shakespeare course at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts during the summer of 2008.
      [in response to a reporter asking her whether she always wore pigtails]: I never wear pigtails, I wear plaits.
      [Hardest scene]: Neville comes up to me with his toad, Trevor, and says, "Do you want to kiss Trevor goodnight?" Every time he did this I burst into laughter. I was supposed to give him an "I hate you" look, but I couldn't help myself. It took me about eight takes to get it.
      It was unbelievable seeing me as an action figure! In a few months, toddlers all around the country will be biting my head off!
      My friends are all really nice about my fame, they're just curious really, they ask lots of questions.
      [on how her character, Hermione Granger, has matured]: She's rock and roll. She's feisty. Girl power!
      [on reporters asking the same questions over and over]: That's the good thing about them! They all ask exactly the same questions and you can say exactly the same answers! You don't have to think, you can just stand there like a broken record going LALALA.
      [on working with boys]: I like being around mixed company. Dan (Daniel Radcliffe) and Rupert (Rupert Grint) definitely make their fair share of cheeky comments about me being girlie, but it's all in good fun.
      It took me three films to get Hermione in jeans. To get out of the robes with the tights and the itchy jumpers. Whoo-hoo!
      I hope my head doesn't get very big. I'm just going to keep my feet on the ground, stick to friends and family and try and lead a normal life.
      [on being a known actress]: Most people are really nice but some stare, like you're some kind of zoo exhibit and not a real person with real feelings. Even when you take away all the glamour and attention and premieres and everything, it still comes down to the fact that I'm acting.
      Hermione uses all these big long tongue twister words, I don't know what she's going on about half the time!
      I could be 100 years old and in my rocker, but i'll still be very proud that I was part of the Harry Potter films.
      [on her co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, who play Harry and Ron]: More than just friends, they've become like brothers. Or sisters, I don't know. In fact, I don't see them like normal boys. I mean that I cannot imagine me going out with one of them. For me, they are like my best friends. I can laugh and talk about everything with them without any taboo. I really like them a lot.
      [on other roles]: Now that I've played the snotty, bossy, posh Hermione Granger, I'd like to play some American high school girl. I want to play something totally different. I want to play every kind of character and every point of view, but I'm probably going to be playing Hermione for a while.
      [If she'd sooner have a great Hollywood career or a great marriage]: Hmmmmm... Can't I have both? But if I would really have to choose, then I'd pick a great marriage. I think it would be amazing if I would get to play beautiful parts and win Oscars, but that would all mean nothing if my parents and friends weren't there with me. What is success when you don't have anybody to love? No, I'd rather be happily married.
      I get sent Bibles. I have a collection of about 20 in my room. People think I need to be guided.
      The most challenging aspect of this film was the fact that I was trying to take my A-levels at the same time I was filming. So my life was crazy. One minute I was on set, and the next minute I was doing an exam, or reading a textbook, or doing something, so I was a bit all over the place. Sometimes it's kind of hard to juggle both aspects of my life.
      If someone asked me to do something that was beneficial to a cause, then maybe I'd consider it, but not just [to be able to say] 'Look at me! I've got my own line!'
      Acting never was about the money for me. ... Maybe in 10 years, I'll be able to appreciate the fact that I am financially stable and independent and I don't have to make bad choices. I can be very picky.
      I'm very crafty! One time I made a television set out of a cardboard box - Everybody thought it was a lark! This was the beginning of a love affair with the arts. I'm now studying art in Brown, a fancy American school.
      Free handbags are lovely, but that's not what I see as the benefits of being famous. It means I can do things I really care about, like The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), which might not have been made otherwise. Being a teenager is quite lonely, particularly for my generation. There's a sense of people being cut off and in isolation. And when I read the script, it just made me feel less alone. My character says this line: 'You accept the love you think you deserve', and that just hit me like a steam train.
      I don't want other people to decide who I am. I want to decide that for myself. I want to avoid becoming too styled and too "done" and too generic. You see people as they go through their career and they just become more and more like everyone else. They start out with something individual about them but it gets lost. Natalie Portman is an exception. I'm in awe of how she's handled herself. And Agyness Deyn is cool, really individual.
      Each of the Harry Potter directors looked as if they had aged about 10 years by the time they'd finished. It's a huge burden to carry.
      I remember reading this thing that Elizabeth Taylor wrote. She had her first kiss in character. On a movie set. It really struck me. I don't know how or why, but I had this sense that if I wasn't really careful, that could be me. That my first kiss could be in somebody else's clothes. And my experiences could all belong to someone else.
      [on Noah (2014)] I was so physically and emotionally exhausted by just the process of making the film. I just didn't leave my apartment for a few weeks afterwards, walked around in my pajamas for a few days in a row. I just needed some time to sort of put myself back together a bit.
      [on childhood fame]: If I went to somewhere busy, I wouldn't last very long. I can't go to a museum, I'll last 10 or 15 minutes in a museum. The problem is that when one person asks for a photograph, then someone sees a flash goes off, then everyone else sort of... It's sort of like a domino effect. And then very quickly the situation starts to get out of control to a point where I can't manage it on my own.
      I guess, weirdly in my head, I knew what I wanted. I didn't know how it would, or if it would, ever happen. But before The Bling Ring (2013) I said I'd really wanted to meet Sofia Coppola and - this is before I knew that she had a film in mind - ended up meeting her. And Darren was someone who actually I met a good year ago. And then I'm doing a film with Guillermo del Toro next summer, and I went to him and said Warner Brothers have given me the script for 'Beauty and the Beast,' but the only way I'd really want to do it is if you did it. And then miraculously he said, 'Oh, funnily enough 'Beauty and the Beast' is my favorite fairy tale, I can't let anyone else do this, I'll start putting a team together.'
      [on fame and her parents] They gave me the best advice they could, and I think they gave me very good advice. But my mum particularly said, 'Right, you're going to go into these interviews and they're going to ask you anything they feel like asking you, and every time they ask you a question, think about whether you'd be comfortable discussing it with a stranger.'
      My first two years at Brown weren't easy, not because I was bullied or because anyone gave me a particularly hard time, but just because, you know, without the collegiate system... and at Brown everyone does completely different things and very much chooses their own path, which is great, but it's also much more difficult, too. You're not with a group of people all the time at one time.
      My grandma said - when I was really young and I'd sing along to the radio - why do you sing in an American accent? I guess it was because a lot of the music I was listening to had American vocalists. And that was something Steve said to me as well: try singing the lines in an American accent. That kind of opened me up. Then I worked with a dialogue coach and I just put in the time to really, really listen and just go over it and over it and over it until I could do it without thinking about it too hard. And I just knew it was really important.
      I don't date people who are famous. I don't think it's fair that, all of a sudden, intimate details of their personal life are public as a direct result of me. I wish I could protect them.

Emma Watson is a British actress and model who reprised the role of the know-it-all, cherubic, side-kick, 'Hermione Granger' in the Harry Potter film franchise. When she committed to the Harry Potter series, little did she know that her life would change forever. She lived an extremely humble life in her earlier days and was selected for this role out of sheer, dumb luck. This doe-eyed beauty was a star student in her school, brilliant at academics (much like her character in the film) and was interested in sports activities and theater productions. Having appeared in a couple of school dramas, her teachers suggested that she try-out for the first installment of the best-selling series. A couple of takes and a few lines later, her life turned completely as she became one of the most recognized and the most bankable Hollywood stars with a worth of over $10 million. Apart from her involvement in the 'Harry Potter' franchise, she has appeared in 'The Tale of Despereaux' and also starred in the film adaptation of 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' and 'Noah'. Acting aside, she has also forayed into modeling and has also begun to spread awareness about a number of humanitarian issues.
