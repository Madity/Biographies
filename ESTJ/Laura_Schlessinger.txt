Laura Catherine Schlessinger (born January 16, 1947) is an American talk radio host, socially conservative commentator and author.[5] Her radio program consists mainly of her responses to callers' requests for personal advice and has occasionally featured her short monologues on social and political topics. Her website says that her show "preaches, teaches, and nags about morals, values and ethics".[6]
Previously, Schlessinger combined a local radio career with a private practice as a marriage and family counselor, but after going into national syndication she concentrated her efforts on the daily The Dr. Laura Program, and on authoring self-help books. The books Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives, and The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands are among her bestselling works. A short-lived television talk show hosted by Schlessinger was launched in 2000. In August 2010, she announced that she would end her syndicated radio show in December 2010.[7][8]
Her show moved to Sirius XM Radio's Sirius XM Stars on January 3, 2011. Schlessinger announced a "multi-year" deal to be on satellite radio.[9][10]
Schlessinger was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Brooklyn and on Long Island.[11] Her parents were Monroe "Monty" Schlessinger, a civil engineer of Jewish heritage, and Yolanda (Ceccovini) Schlessinger, an Italian Catholic war bride.[1][2][12] Schlessinger has said her father was charming and her mother beautiful as a young woman.[1][13] She has a sister, Cindy, who is 11 years her junior.[14] Schlessinger has described her childhood environment as unloving and unpleasant, and her family as dysfunctional. She has ascribed some of the difficulty to extended family rejection of her parents' mixed faith Jewish-Catholic marriage.[1] Schlessinger said her father was "petty, insensitive, mean, thoughtless, demeaning and downright unloving". She described her mother as a person with "pathological pride", who "was never grateful", who "would always find something to criticize," and who "constantly expressed disdain for men, sex and love".[1][13] She credited her father with giving her the drive to succeed.[1]
Schlessinger attended Westbury High School and Jericho High School where she showed an interest in science.[15] She received a bachelor's degree from Stony Brook University.[16] Moving to Columbia University for graduate studies,[17] she earned a master's and Ph.D. in physiology in 1974. Her doctoral thesis was on insulin's effects on laboratory rats.[18][19] After she began dispensing personal advice on the radio, she obtained training and certification in marriage and family counseling from the University of Southern California, and a therapist's license from the State of California. In addition, she opened up a part-time practice as a marriage and family counselor.[20][21]

Schlessinger's first appearance on radio was in 1975 when she called into a KABC show hosted by Bill Ballance. Impressed by her quick wit and sense of humor, Ballance began featuring her in a weekly segment.[22] Schlessinger's stint on Ballance's show led to her own shows on a series of small radio stations. By 1979 she was on the air Sunday evenings from 9:00 to midnight on KWIZ in Santa Ana, California. That year, the Los Angeles Times described her show as dealing with all types of emotional problems, "though sex therapy is the show's major focus".[23]
In the late 1980s, Schlessinger was filling in for Barbara De Angelis' noon-time relationship-oriented talk show in Los Angeles on KFI,[2] while working weekends at KGIL in San Fernando. Her big break came when Sally Jessy Raphael began working at ABC Radio, and Maurice Tunick, former Vice-President of Talk Programming for the ABC Radio Networks, needed a regular sub for Raphael's evening personal advice show. Tunick chose Schlessinger to fill in for Raphael.
Ultimately, Schlessinger began broadcasting a daily show on KFI which was nationally syndicated in 1994 by Synergy, a company owned by Schlessinger and her husband. In 1997, Synergy sold its rights to the show to Jacor Communications, Inc., for $71.5 million.[2] Later, Jacor merged with Clear Channel Communications and a company co-owned by Schlessinger, Take On The Day, LLC, acquired the production rights. The show became a joint effort between Take On The Day, which produced it, Talk Radio Network, which syndicated and marketed it to radio stations, and Premiere Radio Networks, (a subsidiary of Clear Channel), which provided satellite facilities and handled advertising sales. As of September 2009, Schlessinger broadcast from her home in Santa Barbara, California with KFWB as her flagship station.[24] Podcasts and live streams of the show have been available on her website for a monthly fee, and the show was also on XM Satellite Radio.
At its peak, The Dr. Laura Program was the second-highest-rated radio show after The Rush Limbaugh Show, and was heard on more than 450 radio stations.[13] Writing in 1998, Leslie Bennett described the popularity of the show:
In an age of moral relativity, Dr. Laura's certitude compels...Schlessinger's fervor is indisputably evangelical, and her listeners believe her to be a paragon, a beacon of hope and rectitude in a dissolute, degraded world.[2]
In May 2002, the show still had an audience of more than 10 million, but had lost several million listeners in the previous two years as it was dropped by WABC and other affiliates, and was moved from day to night in cities such as Seattle and Boston. These losses were attributed in part to Schlessinger's shift from giving relationship advice to lecturing on morality and conservative politics. Pressure from gay rights groups caused dozens of sponsors to drop the radio show as well.[25] In 2006, Schlessinger's show was being aired on approximately 200 stations.[13] As of 2009, it was tied for third place along with The Glenn Beck Program and The Savage Nation.[26]
Schlessinger used "Hot Talkin' Big Shot", a song by country and blues singer and songwriter Nikki Hornsby, for several years as cue music for her radio program and for a national radio commercial advertising for the show.[27]
On August 17, 2010, during an appearance on Larry King Live, Schlessinger announced the end of her radio show saying that her motivation was to "regain her First Amendment rights",[7] and that she wanted to be able to say what is on her mind without "some special interest group deciding this is a time to silence a voice of dissent."[8] Several of her affiliates and major sponsors had dropped her show after her on air use of a racial epithet on August 10.[28][29]
In 2000, Schlessinger signed a deal with Paramount Domestic Television to produce a syndicated talk show, which would be carried mainly by television stations owned and operated by CBS. The producers hoped to extend the success of Schlessinger's radio show to daytime television, however, the show was controversial before it ever aired, and it proved to be short-lived.
In the months before the premiere of her TV show, Schlessinger called homosexuality a "biological error", said that homosexuality was acceptable as long as it was not public, and said that homosexuals should not attempt to adopt children. She regularly compared gay parenting to pedophilia by reiterating her view that "a huge portion of the male homosexual populace is predatory on young boys."[31] Schlessinger was frequently criticized in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual (LGBT) media for these views. Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), an LGBT media watchdog group, began monitoring Schlessinger's on-air comments about LGBT people, posting transcripts of relevant shows on its website.
In March 2000, a group of gay activists launched StopDrLaura.com, an online campaign with the purpose of convincing Paramount to cancel the Dr. Laura television show prior to its premiere.[32][33][34] The group protested at Paramount studios, stating her views were offensively bigoted. StopDrLaura.com eventually organized protests in 34 cities in the U.S. and Canada,[35][36] and picked up on an advertiser boycott of both the radio and the TV shows started by another grass-roots organization which called itself "Silence Of The Slams" operating its boycott through AOL Hometown.[37]
The first episode of Schlessinger's television show aired September 11, 2000. Critics and viewers complained that the format had been dumbed down and did not stand out from any other daytime talk show. The biting rhetoric that worked well on radio seemed overly harsh for face-to-face discourse, owing to the normal sympathetic nature of most other daytime hosts; the radical change in Schlessinger's demeanor from her radio persona left viewers cold. Ultimately, the television show failed to generate the energy and interest of Schlessinger's radio show.[38]
The credibility of Schlessinger's television program also suffered during its first month when the New York Post reported that Schlessinger had used show staff to falsely pose as guests on the show. A September 25, 2000, episode named "Readin', Writin', and Cheatin'" featured a so-called college student who specialized in professional note-taking. On the next day's show, "Getting to the Altar," the same guest appeared in different hair and makeup and said she was a woman living with her boyfriend. In fact, the woman was San-D Duchas, a researcher for the show whose name appeared in the closing credits of the shows on which she posed as a guest.[39] Apparently, Schlessinger was unaware of this incident until it was disclosed by the Post, and immediately put a stop to any further use of this practice.
By November 2000, advertisers that had originally committed to Schlessinger's show left, and the ratings plummeted.[40] CBS directed its stations to move the show to a late-night slot or replace it altogether.[41] Other stations outside of CBS did the same thing, while others moved it to weaker sister stations. The television show was cancelled in March 2001 and last aired in September 2001.
In 2004, Schlessinger said that although there is more money and celebrity in television, it is not as meaningful or intimate as radio, and for her television was a "terrible experience".[40]
For several years, Schlessinger wrote a weekly column syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate that was carried in many newspapers, as well as Jewish World Review. She discontinued the column in July 2000, citing lack of time due to her upcoming television show.[42] She wrote a monthly column for WorldNetDaily between 2002 and 2004, with one entry in 2006.[43] In 2006, Schlessinger joined the Santa Barbara News-Press, writing bi-weekly columns dealing with Santa Barbara news, as well as general news and cultural issues discussed on her radio show. She suspended the column in mid 2007, resumed writing it later, then discontinued it in December 2008.[44][45] She currently writes columns on her blog, on a variety of topics.[46]
Schlessinger has written thirteen books for adults and four for children. Several follow the mold of her successful Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives, with similarly named books giving advice for men, couples, and parents, while others are more moral in orientation.
For several years, Schlessinger published a monthly magazine, Dr. Laura Perspective. She was the editor, her husband a contributing photographer, and her son the creative consultant.[47] The magazine has since gone out of publication.
Schlessinger has a website which contains hints for stay-at-home parents, her blog, a reading list, and streaming audio of her shows (by subscription only). When it was started, 310,000 people tried to access it simultaneously and it crashed.[2] Certain aspects of feminism are often discussed on her website; she was a self-proclaimed feminist in the 1970s, but is now opposed to feminism.[2][48]
Schlessinger created the Laura Schlessinger Foundation to help abused and neglected children in 1998. Schlessinger regularly asked her on-air audience to donate items for My Stuff bags, which go to children in need. All other donations came from other people or groups, usually in the form of donated items for the bags. Per the foundation's reports, money not used for operations was directed toward pro-life organizations, such as crisis pregnancy centers. In September 2004, Schlessinger announced that she was closing down the foundation because it had become too difficult and costly for her and her husband to underwrite, and they wished to devote their "energies and resources to other pressing needs".[49]
In 2007, Schlessinger began fundraising for Operation Family Fund, an organization which aids the families of fallen or seriously injured veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2008, she helped raise more than $1 million for the organization.[50]
Schlessinger has received numerous awards from both media and conservative organizations. She was the first woman to win the Marconi Award for Network/Syndicated Personality of the Year (1997).[51] In 1998 she received the American Women in Radio & Television's Genii Award. She was on the Forbes top 100 list of celebrities in 2000 with estimated earnings of $13 million.[52] In September 2002, the industry magazine Talkers named Schlessinger as the seventh-greatest radio talk show host of all time.[53] In 2005[54] and 2008,[55] she was nominated for induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame, but was not selected.[56]
Schlessinger received a National Heritage award from the National Council of Young Israel in March 2001.[57] She also received the National Religious Broadcasters Chairman's Award, and has lectured on the national conservative circuit. She was the commencement speaker at Hillsdale College in June 2002, and was awarded an honorary degree as a doctor of tradition and culture.[58]
In 2007, Schlessinger was given an Exceptional Public Service award by the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense. In 2008, Talkers Magazine presented her with an award for outstanding community service by a radio talk show host.[50]
Schlessinger was non-religious until she and her son began practicing Conservative Judaism in 1996.[2] In 1998, Schlessinger, Bishop, and their son converted to Orthodox Judaism,[57] and began instruction under Rabbi Reuven P. Bulka of Ottawa, Ontario. During this time, Schlessinger sometimes used Jewish law and examples to advise her callers about their moral dilemmas. She occasionally clarified ethical and moral issues with her local Orthodox Rabbi Moshe D. Bryski, before mentioning them on the air. She was embraced by many in the politically conservative segment of Orthodox Judaism for bringing more awareness of Orthodoxy to her radio show. Some of her expressed views were explicitly religious, and are referenced her 1999 book The Ten Commandments: The Significance of God's Laws in Everyday Life. Although her other books have stressed the importance of morality, they are more secular in nature.
Schlessinger met and married Michael F. Rudolph, a dentist, in 1972 while she was attending Columbia University. The couple had a Unitarian ceremony.[60] Separating from Rudolph, Schlessinger moved to Encino, California in 1975 when she obtained a job in the science department at the University of Southern California.[61] Their divorce was finalized in 1977.[62]
In 1975, while working in the labs at USC, she met Lewis G. Bishop, a professor of neurophysiology who was married and the father of three children.[2][63] Bishop separated from his wife and began living with Schlessinger the same year.[64] Schlessinger has vociferously proclaimed her disapproval of unwed couples "shacking up" and having children out of wedlock. But according to personal friend, Shelly Herman, "Laura lived with Lew for about nine years before she was married to him."[2] "His divorce was final in 1979.[65] Bishop and Schlessinger married in 1985.[66] Herman says that Schlessinger told her she was pregnant at the time, which Herman recalls as "particularly joyful because of the happy news."[2] Schlessinger's only child, a son named Deryk, was born in November 1985.[67]
Schlessinger was estranged from her sister for years, and many thought she was an only child.[2] She had not spoken to her mother for 18[68] to 20 years before her mother's death in 2002 from heart disease.[13] Her mother's remains were found in her Beverly Hills condo approximately two months after she died,[69][70] and lay unclaimed for some time in the Los Angeles morgue before Schlessinger had them picked up for burial.[71] Concerning the day that she heard about her mother’s death, she said: “Apparently she had no friends and none of her neighbors were close, so nobody even noticed! How sad.”[13][71] In 2006, Schlessinger wrote that she had been attacked in a "vulgar, inhumane manner by media types" because of the circumstances surrounding her mother's death, and that false allegations had been made that she was unfit to dispense advice based on family values. She said that she had not mourned the deaths of either of her parents because she had no emotional bond to them.[1][13]
In 1998, Schlessinger was in a Costa Mesa surf shop with her son when she began perusing the skateboarding magazine, Big Brother. On her radio program, Schlessinger declared the magazine to be "stealth pornography." When the owner of the store publicly denied that she found pornography in his store, Schlessinger sued him for lying, claiming that his denial had hurt her reputation.[72] When the case went to court, the judge dismissed her suit, but the shop owner's $4 million defamation countersuit lodged for hurting the reputation of his store was allowed to stand.[73][74] The suit has since been settled, but the terms of the settlement have not been revealed.[75]
In 1998, Schlessinger's early radio mentor, Bill Ballance, sold nude photos that he had taken of Schlessinger in the mid-1970s to a company specializing in internet porn. The photos were taken while Schlessinger was involved in a brief affair with then-married Bill Ballance.[76][77] Schlessinger sued after the photos were posted on the internet,[78] claiming invasion of privacy and copyright violation. The court ruled that Schlessinger did not own the rights to the photos; she did not appeal the ruling.[79] She told her radio audience that she was embarrassed, but that the photos were taken when she was going through a divorce and had "no moral authority."[76][80]
On August 10, 2010, Nita Hanson, a black woman married to a white man, called Schlessinger's show to ask for advice on how to deal with a husband who did not care when she received racist comments by acquaintances. Schlessinger first replied that "some people are hypersensitive" and because of that she'd need at least 2 good examples of racism the caller had received. The caller informed Schlessinger that the acquaintances in question had stated, "How you black people do this? You black people like doing that." Schlessinger responded by telling the caller that her examples weren't racist and that "A lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black. Didn't matter what he was going to do in office; it was a black thing. You gotta' know that. That's not a surprise." Schlessinger continued by telling the caller, "chip on your shoulder," "sensitive," "Don't NAACP me," "A lot of what I heard from Jade [caller's pseudonym] is a lot of what I hear from black think and it's really distressing and disturbing," etc.[81]
During the call, Schlessinger also used the word "nigger" eleven times. When Hanson asked, "Is it ever ok to say that word?" Schlessinger responded, "It depends how it’s said. Black guys talking to each other seem to think it’s ok." After the call Schlessinger said, "If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race."[81] After the call, Schlessinger immediately took herself off the air, and early that evening wrote an apology to Los Angeles Radio People online journalist Don Barrett. A day later, as soon as she was back on the air, Schlessinger apologized.[82] Hanson questioned the motivation and sincerity of Schlessinger's apology, believing it to be result of being "caught".[83] Hanson also said that Schlessinger did not apologize for her comments on interracial marriage.[84]
I have made the decision not to do radio anymore. I want to regain my First Amendment rights. I want to be able to say what is on my mind.[85]

In 1999, Schlessinger was parodied as Dr. Nora on the sitcom Frasier. The character was portrayed as having dogmatic and fundamentalist social views that promoted social conservatism. The character was also shown to have a degree that belies her therapeutic advice and was estranged from her mother.[87][88]
In 2000, in the episode "The Midterms" on The West Wing, the fictional "Dr. Jenna Jacobs" is scolded by President Bartlet, who criticizes her views on homosexuality, and points out she is not a doctor in any field related to morality, ethics, or theology. He quotes from the Bible to point out the inconsistency of condemning certain sins but not others. Show creator Aaron Sorkin admitted to modeling Bartlet's diatribe on an anonymous "Letter to Dr. Laura," which was a popular viral email at the time.[89][90]

      Life does not have meaning through mere existence or acquisition or fun. The meaning of life is inherent in the connections we make to others through honor and obligation.
      The reward for doing right is mostly an internal phenomenon: self-respect, dignity, integrity, and self-esteem.

Here is information about the marriage of controversial author and radio personality Laura Schlessinger to Lewis Bishop.
Lewis G. Bishop: Abt. 1935.Wedding Date:Laura and Lewis met while he was in a long term marriage.  Lew and Laura lived with one another for approximately 9 years. After his divorce, they married in early 1985.
Education and Professional Certification:Laura: B.S. in Biological Sciences from State University of New York at Stonybrook; Ph.D. in Physiology from Columbia University in New York; 
post-doctoral certification in Marriage, Family, and Child Counseling from University of Southern California.
As of 3/13/2008, her Marriage and Family Therapist license is inactive according to the California Board of Behavioral Sciences online license verification.
Michael F. Rudolph: Laura and Michael, a dentist, were married in 1972. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1976 allegedly due to infidelity.
Quotes About Marriage:Dr. Laura about Lewis: "Sometimes I think he's just crazy, because I can't fathom the magnitude of his uninterrupted love, loyalty, faith, friendship, and unrelenting efforts in behalf of my career."
Dr. Laura: "Commitment to marriage and child rearing was once viewed as the pinnacle of adulthood identity, so that women looked carefully for the "right" man for the job, and parents were consulted for opinions and blessings."
Dr. Laura: "... the 3 A's: Addictions, Abuse, and Affairs, are behaviors, in my opinion, that break the covenant and justify the self-preserving decision to end the relationship. Where the behavior of one or both of the spouses is blatantly destructive, dangerous, or evil, this book does not apply."
Dr. Laura: "Women seem not to understand, or underestimate, the profound power they have over their husbands. Men are very emotionally dependent upon women from the day they are born to the day they expire. This book teaches women to use this power benevolently – which will definitely result in them being happier with life and love ... Men are born of women and between girlfriends and then a wife; men spend their entire lives in the tutelage of women. What women accept or reject is largely the guiding force for what men will and won't do ... Transforming your guy into a loving man is its own reward."
Biography.com: "Schlessinger’s fans admire her bluntness, her humor, and her short, curt style which cut to the root of the problem, while her critics consider her unbearably self-righteous, harsh and insensitive, and question whether callers have an unhealthy attraction to being publicly reprimanded, sometimes very severely. Her moral messages include no sex before marriage, no marriage before thirty, no abortions, no day care, and above all, no whining."
NNDB: "On her radio show, she advocates the basic "family values" -- no sex outside of marriage, moms shouldn't work, divorce is wrong, abortion is wrong, living together without marriage is wrong, marriage too young is wrong, marriage without children is hardly a marriage at all, homosexuality is destructive and in her words "a biological error", gay marriage is wrong, girls should not dress like "sluts", and the family unit is of paramount importance."

Laura SchlessingerRadio PersonalityBorn: 16 January 1947Birthplace: Brooklyn, New YorkBest known as: The radio advice-giver known as "Dr. Laura"Laura Schlessinger's radio advice show has been syndicated throughout America since 1994. Known as Dr. Laura, she dispenses sharp-tongued "tough love" to her callers, emphasizing personal responsibility and traditional religious morality. Schlessinger came to talk radio in 1975 when, after a dozen years as a family therapist, she called into a Los Angeles radio program and hit it off so well with host Bill Ballance that she was soon a regular guest. Eventually she landed her own show, and by 1994 had launched her syndicated advice show as "Dr. Laura." (She is not a medical doctor or psychologist, but earned a Ph.D. in physiology from Columbia University in 1974.) Schlessinger joined the wave of successful conservative radio hosts of the 1990s, but while Rush Limbaugh and others focused on politics, Schlessinger focused on personal morality. Her blunt talk about right and wrong soon made her one of the top radio personalities in the United States. Often controversial, Schlessinger called homosexuality a "biological error" in 1998, setting off a long-running feud with gay activists. She also raised hackles in 2010 when she got into an argument with an African-American caller about the word "nigger" and then told her, "If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race." (She apologized on her show the next day.) Dr. Laura Schlessinger's books include Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives (1994), How Could You Do That?! The Abdication of Character, Courage and Conscience (1996), and The Proper Care & Feeding of Husbands (2004).Extra credit: Laura Schlessinger married Lew Bishop, a professor she met at the University of Southern California, in 1985; their son, Deryk, was born the same year. Schlessinger was married once before, to dentist Michael Rudolph, from 1972-76... Laura Schlessinger had a short-lived television show, Dr. Laura, from 2000-01...

Laura SchlessingerAKA Laura Catherine SchlessingerBorn: 16-Jan-1947Birthplace: Brooklyn, NYGender: FemaleReligion: ChristianRace or Ethnicity: WhiteSexual orientation: StraightOccupation: Radio PersonalityNationality: United StatesExecutive summary: The Dr. Laura ShowWith about 250 affiliates (down from a peak of nearly 500) and an audience of over 7 million listeners, Laura Schlessinger's syndicated radio show is public spectacle -- the lives of faceless strangers impacted by her advice for three hours daily. Callers are often interrupted before they can finish explaining their elaborate personal problems, and frequently receive beratings for what she perceives as moral, parental, or religious failings. Her advice is consistent and listeners know it is coming from moral high ground.
Schlessinger married a dentist when she was 25, and had at least two extramarital affairs before they were divorced[1]. Her first radio appearance was in 1974, as a caller on Bill Ballance's show in Los Angeles. She became a regular caller, and later a guest on Ballance's show, as he became her mentor in radio, and her first known extramarital affair.
After a few years with Ballance, Schlessinger began the program that still runs today as The Dr. Laura Show, although she is neither a medical doctor nor a psychologist. Her PhD is in physiology -- a degree which has nothing to do with human interpersonal relations. Critics of her show point out the ethics of using a degree in one field to imply credibility in another. If most of her audience isn't swayed by that credential, Schlessinger also occasionally refers to herself as a "shrink." She was granted a California Marriage, Family and Child Therapist license in 1980, and later taught at the University of Southern California, USC, and Pepperdine.
While still married to that dentist (and still ostensibly a marriage therapist), Schlessinger met and began another extramarital affair with Lewis G. Bishop, a professor of neuro-physiology and married father of three. They lived together for nine years after divorcing their spouses, and have been married since 1985.
On her radio show, she advocates the basic "family values" -- no sex outside of marriage, moms shouldn't work, divorce is wrong, abortion is wrong, living together without marriage is wrong, marriage too young is wrong, marriage without children is hardly a marriage at all, homosexuality is destructive and in her words "a biological error", gay marriage is wrong, girls should not dress like "sluts", and the family unit is of paramount importance.
Her own family unit has been dysfunctional at best. She describes her childhood as "difficult", due to the rocky, "unloving" marriage between her father, a Jewish US citizen, and her mother, an Italian Catholic war bride. They later divorced. Schlessinger never got along well with her father, and she and her mother had been estranged for at least 14 years before her mother's odd death in 2002. (Her partially decomposed corpse had been on the floor of her apartment for two months before being discovered[2], and police initially suspected murder). Schlessinger has also been estranged from her sister since the mid-1970s[3], and has reportedly told friends she is an only child. She says it was her family that shunned her, not the other way around. "My door is open", Schlessinger has said, on those rare occasions when she mentions her sister. On her show, however, she has often advised listeners to break off contact with troublesome family members. "I love shunning", she says. "It reminds people they have an obligation to others."[4]
In 2000, Schlessinger became the first non-Christian to receive the Chairmans Award from the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB), but her relationship with God has also fluctuated. She says she was raised without religion, but became interested in Judaism as a young adult. She had an unpleasant encounter with a "female rabbi", but says she later  "found her Judaism" with the help of a "male rabbi" at a Conservative synagogue. In 1996 Schlessinger and her son Deryk converted to Conservative Judaism, then switched to Orthodox Judaism in 1998. She has said that her husband Lew, raised an Episcopalian, also converted, but he later admitted he had not completed the conversion. In 2003, Schlessinger announced on the air that she was no longer an Orthodox Jew, that she felt frustrated by the effort she had put into the religion, and complained that she felt little or no connection with God.
Dr. Laura disapproves of divorce and pornography, but as a divorcee she posed for what can be called a "beaver shot" with her legs spread. In October of 1998, this and other naked photos of Schlessinger appeared on the internet. The photographer was Schlessinger's ex-boyfriend Ballance, but as the woman in the photos was so much younger than the present-day Schlessinger, she simply lied at first -- stating that it was a different woman[5]. She then sued for copyright infringement, making the unlikely claim that while the woman in the pictures wasn't her, she owned the copyright to the pictures. Eventually Schlessinger admitted her identity as the subject of the photos[6].
When asked why he posted the pictures, Ballance replied at length. "The fact is, she has been stealing my material for so many years. The fact is, she told so many lies about our relationship, an example being our being together just a week or two, and that she was on my show just a few days, or a few times rather. She was on my show for two and a half years. We went together for a torrid two and a half years. I'm tired of being lied about and the longer it goes on the more people believe her. They'll think I'm the interloper. People will begin to assume that I was the beginner and that she taught me everything I know."[7]
In a memorable August 2010 broadcast, a caller who described herself as African-American asked for advice in dealing with people's rude comments about her interracial marriage, and Schlessinger replied using the word "nigger" several times, criticizing the caller for being overly sensitive and adding, "If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race". Schlessinger apologized the following day, and announced the next week that she would stop her program at the end of 2010. After the furor passed, Schlessinger announced that instead of ending her show, she would simply move it from syndication to Sirius XM.
"If you're gay or a lesbian, it's a biological error that inhibits you from relating normally to the opposite sex. The fact that you are intelligent, creative and valuable is all true. The error is in your inability to relate sexually intimately, in a loving way to a member of the opposite sex -- it is a biological error."

There are several frightening things you hope never to hear in life.  The first might be, "It's malignant."  But the next up would have to be, "Nude pictures of Dr. Laura are now available for download."
ive hundred years ago, she would have been called "a common scold." More recently, she has been called "dictatorial," "rude," "overemotional," "a pain in the ass," "a fraud," "Laura the Hen," "A Psychological Bag Lady," and "Our National Mommy."  
	"I pretty much preach, teach, and nag," she told a reporter from the Washington Post.  "It's not pop psychology at all.  If anything, it's a new genre..." she said.
	She can be heard three hours a day in almost every corner of America.  They tell us that her audience exceeds 18,000,000, on 450 radio stations, and over 50% of her listeners are men.  50,000 or more people try to call in each day.  Her syndicated show recently sold for $71,500,000.  
	Her themes are protect the child, practice family unity, use sexual restraint, stop making excuses, and don't interrupt me.  "Tell me what you think, not what you feel," she says.  "Everything I say is true," she says.  
	She grew up in Brooklyn and on Long Island, with a Catholic mother and a Jewish father.  She was a loner in high school and college, but no one could miss her intensity. She was fascinated with science, and got her PhD at  Columbia University.
	In the midst of her divorce in 1975, she moved to Los Angeles, and tuned in to Bill Ballance and his radio talk-show. She called up during a program about divorce, and they spoke, on the air, for twenty minutes, and then he arranged to meet her, using the oldest of old wheeze come-hither lines, "Someday you're going to be an international radio star."  
	The radio gods must have been smiling down on her, because Ballance was the originator of a new, and rather daring, on-the-air confessional program. Before, call-ins had been  people discussing their fishing trips and their kids and cats and politics of the non-confrontational variety.  Now it was suddenly love, lust, and passion.  Ballance, according to those who knew his show, "talked about sex incessantly."
	  Dr Norton Kristy, another on-the-air radio shrink, said the program evolved into an invitation being extended to women to talk about their most intimate fears and hopes and issues in their lives.  Bill did that.  He was the first in America to do it, and within three years, he was widely copied in America and around the world.
	If Doctor Laura was seeking to become famous, she picked the right guy.  If she was looking for someone who would keep her deepest secrets, she shoulda stood in bed.  Over the years, Ballance seems to have lost whatever little affection he had for his old squeeze.  His uncensored memories of their time together have appeared in The Los Angeles Times, Vanity Fair, and several other newspapers and magazines.  They are uniformly obnoxious, highly personal, and hilarious.
	For instance, there's the matter of pet names.  He called Laura his little plum, she called him her "Pillow Plumsicles."   She wrote notes to him signed, "Your Tottle Bug." We used to thrash around like a couple of crazed weasels, he told Vanity Fair. He dubbed her "Ku Klux."  Why?  Because she is a wizard in the sheets. 
	He didn't limit his comments to their love affair.  "We were sitting in the Musso and Frank Grill on Hollywood Blvd. one day and I said, 'You're scratching your head and a cloud of dandruff is floating over into my consommé.'  
	"Talk about gnashing your teeth; it was an actual snarl.  She said, 'Don't you ever tell anyone I have psoriasis.' I said to Laura, 'If it weren't for your psoriasis you wouldn't have any character at all.'
	Even at that tender age, however, Laura was showing another passion --- one for upward mobility.  Ballance says that she wanted to get into his "la-di-da" hotel in Palm Springs: "I pulled more strings than a cross-eyed harp tuner to get her in..." But with her burgeoning ambition came  a burgeoning captiousness.  No sooner was she in than she resigned.
	And, now, many years after the fact, the coup de grace.  A year or so ago, Ballance sold off some fairly expensive photographs he took of her.  In the buff.  These went for a pretty penny ($50,000 is the figure mentioned) to the Internet Entertainment Group.   Like every other lurid thing you could possibly want --- or have nightmares about --- they are now on-line, listed as "Dr. Laura's Dirty Dozen."  In the interests of professional journalism, I tried to call them up, but the entry fee at IEG was a bit steep.  For some reason, this magazine --- the original corporate cheapskate --- refused to spring for the tariff.
he calls herself Dr. Laura.  But, according to the California Board of Behavioral Science Examiners, Nobody is allowed to use 'Doctor' unless they are a medical doctor or...a professor in the psychological field with a clinical license.  Schlessinger has a PhD, but it isn't in psychology --- it's in  physiology.  Her doctorate was entitled Effects of Insulin on 3-0 Methylglucose Transport in Isolated Rat Adipocytes.  According to one of her professors, she spent most of her doctoral training time "pulling fat pads off rat testicles." 
	I asked a friend of mine who works in the field what "Methylglucose Transport" is all about.  He said,
It's the standard, routine, crushingly dull thing done back in the days before DNA. Physiology is the term used for lower-level biochemistry.However, he concluded, it does not sound like an obvious portal into psychology, even of the broadcast variety.  
	Despite all this, and despite the fact that many consider Laura Schlessinger the Dragon Lady of talk radio, some of us can't help but admiring her.  She is snippish, overbearing, and often insulting  --- but anybody who has the temerity to call in to her program knows what they are going to get, especially if they plea ignorance or innocence.
 	Not only does Schlessinger stick it to all those tedious people who call up on the air, she does it, in spades, to those who pay for outside appearances.  In 1997, she appeared before the League of Dallas at a benefit.  It was question-and-answer.  In response to what she thought was a dumb question, she said, "If you listened to my program, you know those are the kind of things I'm not even going to address: They are too frivolous."  
	Later, at another meeting, she said, "I'm glad to be in Dallas.  You look so good.  I expected to find a bunch of overweight people."  Someone got up and says she  wanted to know how to deal with being grandmother to "intermarried children."  Laura  snapped, "My grandmother's dead.  I wouldn't say anything because my grandmother's dead."  
	 The Dallas contingent paid Dr. Laura $30,000 to come and insult them.  So be it. There are some fine people out there in the world of psychotherapy, those who have rare insights into families and the theories of family therapy, those who have spent years in the trenches --- people like Jay Haley, Cloe Madanes, Salvador Minuchin, and Mara Selvini Palazzoli. Any organization fool enough to pay $30,000 for an appearance by a drive-time bug doctor instead of getting an honest professional for a tenth of the cost deserves, we do believe, what they get. 
ickie Bane, the author of Dr. Laura, writes for People magazine, and it shows. She's one of those writers direct from the breathless school of journalism, where a sentence, for some reason, is considered to be co-equal to a paragraph. 
	The book starts out with an interview with Schlessinger's mother, who Laura hasn't seen or called for fourteen years.  Bane puts it right up front.   Now we know what kind of hypocrite she is, it seems to be telling us.  But if Laura doesn't necessarily practice what she preaches --- who does?  I've gone to psychotherapists who've had hideous family lives --- brothers and sisters not speaking to each other, parents murdering each other with hate, malingering husbands and wives.  That didn't stop them from encouraging me to maintain good communication with a parent, or with my siblings.
	Bane quotes endless nosy speculations about Laura's psychological state-of-mind --- doubtful insights not from the professionals, but from other on-the-air gabfest shrinks.  "My own observations were that Laura had experienced a great deal of childhood insecurity and need," intones Dr. Norman Kristy, who has his own on-the-air psychology pop show, "and that it had left her with a rather hard outer shell in which she was sardonic and humorous, and pretended to a degree of tough-minded  strength that really did not go very deep."    
 	Dr. Carole  Lieberman, who writes a "celebrity psychoanalysis column for one of the tabloids,"  mutters, darkly, "Dr. Laura has a lot of demons that are hidden, suppressed." 
	Marilyn Kagan, with her own television agony show in Los Angeles, says, "She has a right to her own opinion, but the way she expresses herself is so demeaning...It supports the denial of her hostility."
arshall McLuhan famously opined that television was a "cool" medium, while radio was a "hot tribal drum."  
"For tribal peoples, for those whose entire social existence is an extension of family life, radio will...be a violent experience," he said in Understanding Media.   "It takes cartoon characters seriously."  At the time, he was referring to Nikita Khrushchev --- but if he were alive today, these cartoon figures would be the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern, Gordon Liddy, Toni Grant, Don Imus --- and Laura Schlessinger. 
	If you think of Dr. Laura is an expert, offering true psychological insight, forget it.  She's an expert motivational entertainer, right up there with all the other McCluhanesque drummers. Her medium is the harsh, raspy voice of AM radio. With her terse comments, her impatience with her "clients," her famous rants --- she's perfect for the job of being the National Nag.
	 I would also suggest that we have to love Dr. Laura not only for being so tacky, but also for having posed au naturel for an old sweetie.  There are those of us out here who would give a pretty penny to having such a shrink; one  with the chutzpah to strip down to nothing more than skin and bone for her honey's camera  --- calling him "Your Tottle Bug" all the while.
	As Bane tells it, when Laura and her husband Lew moved to Lake Arrowhead, California, she bought a Cobalt --- what some call "the Mercedes of speed boats."   After she got it, and more than once, according to people at the local marina, "She kept insisting there was something wrong with this boat because of the bubbles, and she wanted the owners to take it back."  
	Yeah.  She said that "the bubbles that come up from the back of her boat didn't look like everyone else's bubbles."  
	How could you not love her for that?--- L. W. MilamNote: This review appeared in slightly different form in  salon.com
