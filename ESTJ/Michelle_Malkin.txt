=======================================================
Michelle Malkin (née Maglalang; born October 20, 1970) is an American conservative blogger, political commentator, and author.[2][3] Her weekly syndicated column appears in a number of newspapers and websites.[2] She is a Fox News Channel contributor and has been a guest on MSNBC, C-SPAN, and national radio programs. Malkin has written four books published by Regnery Publishing.
Malkin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Philippine citizens Rafaela (née Perez) – a homemaker and teacher – and Apolo DeCastro Maglalang, who was then a physician-in-training.[1] Several months prior to Malkin's birth, her parents had immigrated to the United States on an employer-sponsored visa.[4] After her father finished his medical training, the family moved[5] to Absecon, New Jersey. Malkin has a younger brother.[6] She has described her parents as Reagan Republicans who were "not incredibly politically active."[1]
Malkin, a Roman Catholic,[1][7] attended Holy Spirit Roman Catholic High School, where she edited the school newspaper and aspired to become a concert pianist.[1] Following her graduation in 1988, she enrolled at Oberlin College.[1] Malkin originally planned to pursue a bachelor's degree in music, but changed her major to English.[1] During her college years, she worked as a press inserter, tax preparation aide, and network news librarian.[8] Her first article for the paper heavily criticized Oberlin's affirmative action program and received a "hugely negative response" from other students on campus.[1] She graduated in 1992[9] and later described her alma mater as "radically left-wing."[1][10]
Malkin began her journalism career at the Los Angeles Daily News, working as a columnist from 1992 to 1994. In 1995, she worked in Washington, D.C., as a journalism fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute,[11] a free-market, anti-government regulation, libertarian think tank.[12] In 1996, she moved to Seattle, Washington, where she wrote columns for The Seattle Times. Malkin became a nationally-syndicated columnist with Creators Syndicate in 1999.[13][14]
For many years, Malkin was a frequent commentator for Fox News Channel and a regular guest host of The O'Reilly Factor. In 2007, she announced that she would not return to The O'Reilly Factor, claiming that Fox News had mishandled a dispute over derogatory statements made about her by Geraldo Rivera in a Boston Globe interview.[15] Since 2007, she has concentrated on her writing, blogging and public speaking, although she still appears on television occasionally, especially with Sean Hannity on Fox News and Fox & Friends once a week.
In August 2004, following claims by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth that presidential candidate John Kerry had lied about his record during the Vietnam War, Malkin appeared on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews and stated that there were "legitimate questions" over whether one of Kerry's wounds was "self-inflicted." When host Chris Matthews asked her eleven times whether she meant Kerry had shot himself on purpose, she dodged the question.[16] but ultimately said that other soldiers had made this claim.[17] Malkin criticized Matthews and the MSNBC staff in her blog the following day.[16] Georgia Senator Zell Miller, while later being interviewed by Mathews, accused him of "browbeating her to death." Mathews explained, "When somebody comes on my show and makes an allegation that somebody committed a felony, I'm going to browbeat them. I want them to say the truth. And if they can't come out with the truth, they shouldn't be talking."[16][18]
Malkin founded the websites Hot Air, an internet broadcast network, and Twitchy.com, a Twitter content curation site.[19]
Her first book, Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and Other Foreign Menaces (2002)[20] was a New York Times bestseller.
In 2004, she wrote In Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror,[21] defending the U.S. government's internment of 112,000 Japanese Americans in prison camps during World War II, and arguing that the same procedures could be used on Arab- and Muslim-Americans today. The book engendered harsh criticism from several Asian American civil rights organizations.[22] The Historians' Committee for Fairness, an organization of scholars and professional researchers, condemned the book for not having undergone peer review and argued that its central thesis is false.[23][24] As a result of the controversy, the Hawaii-based newspaper MidWeek dropped her column in August 2004;[25] The Virginian-Pilot called her "an Asian Ann Coulter" and dropped her column in November 2004.[26] Malkin responded: "I'm not Asian, I'm American," and described the comparison to Coulter as "a compliment."[27]
Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks, and Cronies, Malkin's fourth book, was released in July 2009[29] and was a The New York Times Non-Fiction, Hardcover Best Seller for six weeks.[30][31][32] Malkin said she hoped the book would "shatter completely the myths of hope and change in the new politics in Washington," described the Obama administration as run by "influence peddlers, power brokers and very wealthy people," and called it "one of the most corrupt administrations in recent memory."[33] She later discussed chapter two of the book, "Bitter Half: First Crony Michelle Obama," on NBC's Today show. She described Michelle Obama as "steeped in the politics of the Daley machine," and as having based her professional career on nepotism and "old white boy" network connections.[34]
In June 2004 Malkin successfully launched a political blog, MichelleMalkin.com.[35] A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Malkin as one of the five "best-read national conservative bloggers",[36] and Technorati ranks MichelleMalkin.com consistently in its "Top 100 blogs of all types".[37] In 2011, the people search company PeekYou claimed that Malkin had the largest digital footprint of any political blogger.[38]
After she criticized hip hop artist Akon for "degrading women" in a Vent episode, Akon's record label, Universal Music Group, forced YouTube to remove the video by issuing a DMCA takedown notice,[39] but decided to retract this notice[40] after the Electronic Frontier Foundation joined Malkin and Hot Air in contesting the removal as a misuse of copyright law.[41]
In an interview with BusinessWeek magazine in July 2007, Malkin said, "We’re doing what few other blogs can do. We serve up terabytes of bandwidth... I'm shelling out for gold-plated servers. That's expensive, and we want to be able to withstand huge traffic surges."[42]
She continued to contribute frequently to MichelleMalkin.com, and in June 2007, she revamped it, moving it to a larger server on WordPress.[43] With the new redesign, she re-enabled comments on her blog, which she said she had disallowed after February 2005 due to a high level of obscene and racist comments.[44] Malkin states her policy thus: "I may allow as much or as little opportunity for registration as I choose, in my absolute discretion, and I may close particular comment threads."[45]
Malkin was among the first of several bloggers who questioned the credibility and even the existence of Iraqi police Captain "Jamil Hussein" who had been used as a source by the Associated Press in over 60 stories about the Iraq war. The controversy started in November 2006 when the AP reported that six Iraqis had been burned alive as they left a mosque and that four mosques had been destroyed, citing Hussein as one of its sources. In January 2007, Malkin visited Baghdad, and stated, "the Iraqi Ministry of Interior says disputed Associated Press source Jamil Hussein does exist. At least one story he told the AP just doesn’t check out: The Sunni mosques that as Hussein claimed and AP reported as 'destroyed,' 'torched' and 'burned and blown up' are all still standing. So the credibility of every AP story relying on Jamil Hussein remains dubious."[46] Malkin has since issued a correction for her denial of Hussein's existence.[47] Malkin contests the extent of damage to the mosques as reported by the AP. Malkin visited Iraq and stated, "several mosques did, in fact, come under attack by Mahdi Army forces." She further speculated that a corroborating witness to the Hussein account who had, according to the AP, recanted due to Iraqi government pressure, instead recanted because his story wasn't true. Malkin said the summary reports she obtained from US and Iraqi army officials didn't corroborate the claim about people being burned alive while Iraqi soldiers failed to intervene.[46]
In April 2006, Students Against War (SAW), a campus group at University of California, Santa Cruz, staged a protest against the presence of military recruiters on campus, and sent out a press release containing contact details (names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses) of three student leaders for use by reporters. Malkin included these contact details in a blog column entitled "Seditious Santa Cruz vs. America".[48] Malkin claimed the contact information was originally taken from SAW's own website, but that later SAW had removed it and had "wiped" the "cached version".[49] The students asked Malkin to remove the contact details from her blog, but Malkin reposted them several times[50] writing in her blog: "I am leaving it up. If you are contacting them, I do not condone death threats or foul language. As for SAW, my message is this: You are responsible for your individual actions. Other individuals are responsible for theirs. Grow up and take responsibility."[48]
SAW remarked: "Due to the continued irresponsible actions of some bloggers, members of the group have received numerous death threats and anti-Semitic comments through phone calls and emails."[51] A blog war ensued. Malkin claimed that she received hostile e-mails[52] then her private home address, phone number, photos of her neighborhood and maps to her house were published on several websites. The Santa Cruz Sentinel reported receiving an email from Malkin saying that this forced her to remove one of her children from school and move her family.[53]
Another controversy involving private addresses began on July 1, 2006, when Malkin and other bloggers commented on a New York Times Travel section article that had featured the town where Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld owned summer homes. The article included a picture of Rumsfeld's long tree-lined driveway that showed a birdhouse and small portion of the housefront.[54] Malkin declared that this story was part of "a concerted, organized effort to dig up and publicize the private home information of prominent conservatives in the media and blogosphere to intimidate them." The photos of Rumsfeld's house were taken with Rumsfeld's permission.[55]
On April 24, 2006, Hot Air, a "conservative Internet broadcast network," went into operation, with Malkin as founder/CEO.[56] She intended the blog to provide "content and analysis you can't get anywhere else on a daily basis–both on the blog and in our original video features".[57] Her staffers included 'Allahpundit' and Bryan Preston, though the latter was replaced by Ed Morrissey on February 25, 2008.[58] In February 2010, Hotair.com was bought by Salem Communications and is no longer administered by Malkin.[59]
Malkin believes that the custom of granting automatic citizenship at birth to U.S.–born children of foreign tourists, temporary foreign workers, and illegal aliens undermines the integrity of citizenship and national security. She argues that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, "originally intended to ensure the citizenship rights of newly freed slaves and their families after the Civil War, has evolved into a magnet for alien lawbreakers and a shield for terrorist infiltrators and enemy combatants".[60]
Malkin also opposes sanctuary cities, in which local authorities do not enforce all national immigration laws or coordinate with agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Following the August 2007 execution-style murder of three college students in Newark, New Jersey, she repeated her criticisms of politicians' posture toward sanctuary cities. In particular, she criticized former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's proposal for a tamper-proof identification card with this comment:
"What Rudy-come-lately fails to comprehend is that there are already multiple alien tracking databases mandated by federal law that have yet to be fully implemented, integrated and used. The reason they don’t work is because open-borders interests have sabotaged them by restricting funding for them, objecting to them on civil liberties grounds, and pushing local and state governments to forbid public employees from checking them to verify citizenship status. Ring a bell, Rudy?"[61]
She supports coordination with federal authorities through the use of Section 287(g) of the IIRIRA to investigate, detain, and arrest aliens on civil and criminal grounds.[62][63] Malkin supports the detention and deportation of some immigrants, regardless of legal status, on national security grounds.[22]
During an appearance as a news analyst on the roundtable segment of ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on August 2, 2009, she explained why she opposed another 13-week extension of unemployment benefits: "If you put enough government cheese in front of people they are going to just keep eating it and kicking the can down the road... people will just delay getting a job until the three weeks before the benefits run out."[64]
In a February 2012 column, Malkin called the "War on Women" a false narrative, arguing rather that "It's the progressive left in this country that has viciously and systematically slimed female conservatives for their beliefs."[65]
At Oberlin, she began dating Jesse Malkin[66] who was granted a Rhodes Scholarship to begin study at Oxford University in 1991.[67] They married in 1993, and have two children. Jesse Malkin worked as an associate policy analyst and economist focusing on healthcare issues for the RAND Corporation.[68] In 2004, Malkin reported on her website that her husband had left a "lucrative health-care consulting job" to be a stay-at-home dad.[66][69]
In 2006, Malkin gave a lecture at her alma mater, Oberlin College, discussing racism, among other topics.[70] She denied allegations that she had been insensitive to the "plight of minorities," listing several racial epithets that had been used against her, and by relating a lesson she learned from her mother for which she is "eternally grateful."[70] When in kindergarten, Malkin went home in tears one day because her classmates had called her a racist name. But, her mother comforted Michelle by telling her that everyone has prejudices.[70]
Malkin and her family lived in North Bethesda, Maryland until 2008 when they relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado.[71][72]

Conservative Credentials:Syndicated columnist, blogger, author and political pundit, Michelle (Maglalang) Malkin consistently identifies with conservatives on every issue from abortion to the War on Terror. Her blog, MichelleMalkin.com iss an enormously popular site, and her regular appearances as a political commentator on FOX News have made her a well-known celebrity. In 2009, she released Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks, and Cronies, an indictment of the policies of the president and his administration. She publishes bi-weekly for a variety of national publications and weekly for Jewish World Review.Early Life:Malkin was born in Philadelphia on Oct. 20, 1970 to legal Filippino immigrants Apolo and Rafaela Maglalang, who had arrived in the U.S. with an employer-sponsored visa earlier in the year. Her father, a doctor-in-training at the time, finished school and moved the family to South Jersey, in the town of Abescon, where he and his wife, a schoolteacher, raised their daughter as a Catholic in a Reagan-Republican household. After graduating from Holy Spirit Catholic High School in 1988, Malkin, by then an accomplished classical pianist, attended Oberlin College in Ohio, a school well-known for its music program.Early Political Activism:Malkin quickly realized she wasn't going to "cut it" as a concert pianist, so she switched her major to English and got a job writing for a conservative independent campus newspaper run by a Jewish student named Jesse Malkin, who would go on to become her husband in 1993. The paper soon became part of a conglomerate of college newspapers funded by the neoconservative Institute for Educational Affairs and co-founded by Irving Kristol. Malkin's first run-in with the vitriolic liberal establishment came after she published an article critical of Oberlin's affirmative action program.Early Career:After graduation, she interned briefly for NBC, then moved to Los Angeles, where she worked from 1992 to 1994 as an editorial writer and weekly columnist with the Los Angeles Daily News. In 1995, she became an editorial board member at the Seattle Times, where she continued to write editorials and weekly columns. In 1999, Malkin and her family moved to Maryland, where her husband began a lucrative job as a consultant for the RAND Corporation, and she became a journalism fellow at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a Washington think-tank advocating free-market public policy.Rise to Prominence:Free from the traditional newsroom constraints, Malkin worked from home and sharpened her combative and ostentatious style. After 9/11, she became an outspoken voice for conservatives, releasing her first book, Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and Other Foreign Menaces to Our Shores, which became a New York Times bestseller on Nov. 17, 2002. In 2004, she launched the political blog bearing her name, and in 2006, she co-founded the conservative site, Hot Air. By 2007, Malkin's weekly column appeared in roughly 150 newspapers across the country.UC Santa Cruz Controversy:Twoweeks before Hot Air went live in April 2006, Malkin became embroiled in a blog war (not her first) with the radically liberal group, Students Against War. Malkin was so outraged that the group had successfully petitioned officials at University of California at Santa Cruz to force military recruiters from a job fair that she published the contact information from their press release on her site (just names, e-mails and phone numbers). The students responded by posting Malkin's home address, complete with a map, directions and pictures, on their site, which forced Malkin and her family to move.Dispute with AP Over Iraq War Coverage:In early 2007, Malkin became agitated by what she saw as highly biased coverage of the Iraq war from the Associated Press. After a series of particularly damning articles ran, alleging that four mosques were destoyed and 13 Sunnis had been burned alive by Shiite militiamen, Malkin flew to Baghdad verify the facts. While Malkin's allegations that Hussein didn't exist ultimately didn't jibe with Hussein's version -- and subsequently the AP's -- of the story. She discovered that all four of the mosques still standing and that no one had been lit on fire.Immigration Stance:Perhaps Malkin's most consistently controversial position, and the one that is most often seized upon by liberal bloggers, is her view on immigration. Many believe Malkin is hypocritical when she lambastes the 14th Amendment, which permits the children of visitors to the U.S. to become American citizens. Her problem, however, isn't with the children of legal aliens who are moving toward citizenship. She believes that the children of tourists, temporary residents and illegals shouldn't be permitted to gain automatic citizenship.

Bergdahl's Platoon Hits Back Against Being Called 'Psychopaths' and 'Swift Boaters' by Obama Allies | Katie Pavlich
EXCLUSIVE: Unaccompanied Children in Sleeping in Cages as Texas, Arizona Border Patrol Resources Continue to Be Overwhelmed | Katie Pavlich
                    Michelle Malkin is a conservative blogger, syndicated columnist, Fox News Channel contributor, and author of Culture of Corruption.
Michelle Malkin started her journalism career at the Los Angeles Daily News in 1992 and moved to the Seattle Times in 1996. Her popular newspaper column has been syndicated nationally by Creators Syndicate since 1999.
Malkin publishes her widely read conservative blog -- michellemalkin.com (her personal site) -- and founded hotair.com, a leading news and opinion group blog on the right.
Michelle Malkinhas worked as a Fox News Channel contributor since 2001, where she appears frequently on "The Sean Hannity Show," "Fox & Friends" and other programs.
Michelle Malkin has written four best-selling books: "Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and other Foreign Menaces to Our Shares (Regnery 2002), "In Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror" (Regnery 2004), "Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild" (Regnery 2005), "Culture of Corruption" (Regnery 2009).
Michelle Malkin is a Philly-born, New Jersey-raised alumna of Holy Spirit High School and Oberlin College. Malkin lives in Colorado Springs with her husband and two children.
                Ten years ago this month, U.S. Marine Wassef Ali Hassoun disappeared from Camp Fallujah in Iraq. After a five-month military investigation, he was charged with desertion and theft, brought back to Virginia's Quantico Marine base and then transferred to North Carolina's Camp Lejeune for trial.
                Five years ago, I publicly raised questions about Bowe Bergdahl's desertion from Blackfoot Company, 1-501 Infantry (Airborne), 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division.
                Like millions of other American parents, my husband and I received a warning letter from the BMI police last week.
                Behold Canada and America. One country supports the efforts of a U.S. special forces soldier's widow to hold accountable the jihadist who killed her husband and the father of her two young children. The other country helped free that jihadist from Guantanamo Bay in a shady deal that appeased his far-left allies.
                A government that fails to secure its borders is guilty of dereliction of duty. A government that fails to care for our men and women on the frontlines is guilty of malpractice. A government that puts the needs of illegal aliens above U.S. veterans for political gain should be prosecuted for criminal neglect bordering on treason.
                Look out, everyone: The nation's school lunch lady, Michelle Obama, is mad. With her federal nutrition program under fire across the country and now on Capitol Hill, Mrs. Obama put out a "forceful" call to arms this week to "health activists," according to The Washington Post.
                At least 40 American veterans are dead thanks to bureaucratic delays at Veterans Affairs clinics.
                When Obamacare operatives aren't busy trashing the private health insurance market and squandering billions on useless technology, they're busy ... being idle. File the latest example of government health care profligacy under "Caution: Your tax dollars not at work."
                All politics is local. So Republican politicians with national ambitions better pay attention to what grassroots parents are saying and doing about the federal education racket known as Common Core. In bellwether Indiana this week, anti-Common Core activists won a pair of pivotal electoral victories against GOP Gov. Mike Pence.
                Hannibal Lecter. Freddy Kreuger. Jason Voorhees. Charles Manson. Jeffrey Dahmer. Ted Bundy. Hollywood loves a homicidal monster. But what happens when an evil being exposes the monstrosities of malign government neglect and deadly ideology? Crickets.
                This weekend on "Fox News Sunday," anchor Chris Wallace credited his guest, Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, with leading the nation as the "first state to fall out of the Common Core national education standards." If only it were true.
                The Obama administration doesn't have watchdogs. It has whitewash puppies. The president's Chicago bullies have defanged true advocates for integrity in government in D.C. from day one.
                I've always thought entrenched left-wing journalists in Washington needed their heads examined. Much to my satisfaction, it appears the corporate media bosses of at least one Beltway anchor now agree.
                Zeituni Onyango, President Obama's illegal alien aunt, died this week of cancer and other complications. I hope she rests in peace. America, however, should be up in arms.
                I have created a new species designation for the female Democrats who play hypocritical gender politics on behalf of Barack Obama. They're genderhawks.
                Attention, class: A Common Core mouthpiece wants to rap my knuckles with his Gates Foundation-funded ruler. In response to my column two weeks ago about the marketing overlords pushing the Fed Ed racket, Chad Colby of Achieve Inc. demanded corrections. Let's go to school.
                Question: Who are the most prominent public purveyors of Asian stereotypes and ethnic language-mocking in America? The right answer is liberal Hollywood and Democrats.
                Has Nancy Pelosi seen a newspaper lately? (Pro tip, hon: Like the Obamacare monstrosity, you have to read it to find out what's in it.) 
                It's 9 a.m. on a weekday, and I'm at the Marisol Therapeutics pot shop. This is serious business. Security is tight. ID checks are frequent. Merchandise is strictly regulated, labeled, wrapped and controlled. The store is clean, bright and safe. The staffers are courteous and professional. Customers of all ages are here.
