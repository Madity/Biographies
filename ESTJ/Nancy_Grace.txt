Nancy Ann Grace (born October 23, 1959)[1] is an American legal commentator, television host, television journalist, and former prosecutor. She frequently discusses issues from what she describes as a "victims' rights" standpoint, with an outspoken style that has brought her both praise and criticism. She is the host of Nancy Grace (2005–present), a nightly celebrity news and current affairs show on HLN, and she was the host of Court TV's Closing Arguments (1996–2007). She also co-wrote the book Objection! — How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal Justice System. She was also the arbiter of Swift Justice with Nancy Grace in the syndicated courtroom reality show's first season. Due to the show relocating from Atlanta, Georgia (where Grace lives), she was replaced by former Clark County District Court Judge Jackie Glass. The show was not renewed for a new season under Glass.
Nancy Grace was born in Macon, Georgia, the youngest of three children, to Mac Grace, a freight agent for Southern Railway, and Elizabeth Grace, a factory worker.[2] Grace has two older siblings: a brother, Mac Jr., and a sister, Ginny.[3] The members of the Grace family have been longtime members of Macon's Liberty United Methodist Church, where Nancy's mother plays the church organ and her father was once a Sunday School teacher.[3]
Grace attended high school at Macon's Windsor Academy, graduating in 1977.[4] She attended Valdosta State University, and later received a B.A. from Mercer University.[5] As a student, Grace was a fan of Shakespearean literature, and intended to become an English professor after graduating from college.[2] However, after the murder of her fiancé, Keith Griffin, when she was 19, Grace decided to enroll in law school and went on to become a felony prosecutor and a supporter of victims' rights.[6]
Grace received her Juris Doctor from the Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer, where she was a member of the law review. She went on to earn a Master of Laws in constitutional and criminal law from New York University.[6] She has written articles and opinion pieces for legal periodicals, including the American Bar Association Journal.[6] Grace worked as a clerk for a federal court judge and practiced antitrust and consumer protection law with the Federal Trade Commission.[6] She taught litigation at the Georgia State University College of Law and business law at GSU's School of Business.[6] As of 2006, she is part of Mercer University's board of trustees and adopted a section of the street surrounding the law school.
Grace worked for nearly a decade in the Atlanta-Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney's office as Special Prosecutor. Her work focused on felony cases involving serial murder, serial rape, serial child molestation, and serial arson.[7] Grace left the prosecutors' office after the District Attorney she had been working under decided not to run for reelection.[8]
After leaving the Fulton County prosecutors' office, Grace was approached by and accepted an offer from Court TV founder Steven Brill to do a legal commentary show alongside Johnnie Cochran. When Cochran left the show, Grace was moved to a solo trial coverage show on Court TV.[8]
In 2005, she began hosting a regular primetime legal analysis show called Nancy Grace on CNN Headline News (now HLN) in addition to her Court TV show.[7] On May 9, 2007, Grace announced that she would be leaving Court TV to focus more on her CNN Headline News Program and charity work.[9] She did her last show on Court TV on June 19, 2007.
Grace has a distinctive interviewing style mixing vocal questions with multimedia stats displays. The Foundation of American Women in Radio & Television has presented Nancy Grace with two Gracie Awards for her Court TV show.[7]
Grace had been covering the Casey Anthony story for years. After the controversial verdict finding Casey Anthony not guilty, her show on HLN had its highest ratings ever in the 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. hour slots on Tuesday, July 5, 2011.[10]
Grace also hosted Swift Justice with Nancy Grace premiering September 13, 2010, and running until May 2011. Grace left the show due to productions moving from Atlanta to Los Angeles. In September 2011, Judge Jackie Glass, who is known for presiding over the O. J. Simpson robbery case, took over Grace's place. The show continued for one more season and ceased production in 2012.
In a 2011 New York Times article, David Carr wrote, "Since her show began in 2005, the presumption of innocence has found a willful enemy in the former prosecutor turned broadcast judge-and-jury". He criticized her handling of the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart, the Duke lacrosse case, the Melinda Duckett interview and suicide and the Caylee Anthony case. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told Carr that Grace, as an attorney and reporter, "has managed to demean both professions with her hype, rabid persona, and sensational analysis. Some part of the public takes her seriously, and her show erodes the respect for basic rights."[11]
In January 2014, she again ignited controversy for her wildly negative depiction of recreational marijuana users. Grace made statements such as users were "fat and lazy" and that anyone who disagreed with her was "lethargic, sitting on the sofa, eating chips" to CNN's news correspondent Brooke Baldwin during a segment covering legalization in Colorado on January 6, 2014.[12]
During the 2002 Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case, when suspect Richard Ricci was arrested by police on the basis that he had a criminal record and had worked on the Smarts' home, Grace immediately and repeatedly proclaimed on Court TV and CNN's Larry King Live that Ricci was guilty, although there was little evidence to support this claim. She also suggested publicly that Ricci's girlfriend was involved in the cover-up of his alleged crime. Grace continued to accuse Ricci, though he died while in custody.[13] It was later revealed that Smart was kidnapped by Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee, two individuals with whom Ricci had no connection.[14]
When Court TV confronted Grace seven months later to ask whether she was incorrect in her assertion that Ricci was guilty, and whether or not she felt bad about it in any way, she stated that Ricci was "a known ex-con, a known felon, and brought suspicion on himself, so who could blame anyone for claiming he was the perpetrator?" When Larry King asked her about the matter, she equated criticism of herself with criticism of the police in the case. She said: "I'm not letting you take the police with me on a guilt trip."[15]
In July 2006, Grace interviewed Smart, who was promoting a legislative bill. Grace repeatedly asked her for information regarding her abduction. Smart told her she didn't feel comfortable discussing it, despite Grace's persistence in the matter. Finally, Grace stopped when Smart said she "didn't appreciate [Grace] bringing all this up."[16]
During the trial of David Westerfield in 2002 for the kidnap and murder of Danielle van Dam, Nancy Grace made it clear on Larry King Live that she thought he was guilty, but she got many facts wrong, and she also made some statements pointing to his possible innocence. She accused him of steam-cleaning his RV, but Dr. Henry Lee pointed out that, had he done so, they wouldn't have found the fingerprints and the bloodstain on the carpet.[17][18] In fact, very little cleaning had been done, as evidenced by the absence of the smell of cleaning products, and the fine layer of dust throughout the interior of the vehicle, and it was the van Dams, not Westerfield, who had a steam-cleaner.[19]
Grace argued that Westerfield's black jacket was leather, so van Dam hairs and fibers would not have been transferred onto it by "dirty dancing" at the bar on Friday night.[20] But the jacket was open and his shirt wasn't leather, so there could have been transfer. She also thought he kept his jacket on while taking a shower: "that must be some mighty tough DNA to stick to a leather jacket and live through a shower." That statement shows she made another mistake: Danielle's blood was not on the jacket he was wearing Friday night - no evidence was found on any of his Friday night clothing.[19]
The strongest evidence against Westerfield was in his RV, particularly a drop of Danielle's blood and her handprint. All that small amount of evidence could be innocently explained if, at some previous time while it was parked unlocked in the streets outside her home, Danielle had entered that vehicle, perhaps to explore it out of curiosity. There was no testimony she had done so, but to her credit, Grace said she "can imagine a little girl wandering into a RV and playing in it, much as if they saw a swimming pool, they might jump in, or a playground, they might play on it".[17]
She also thought that the parents' friend Barbara Easton (the one who "let the cat out of the bag" over the parents' sexual activities), wasn't called to testify because she "could go into further evidence of wife-swapping and Swinging on the part of the victims' family". So Grace didn't think the whole truth had been revealed.[19]
Grace took a vehemently pro-prosecution position throughout the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, in which Crystal Gail Mangum, a stripper and North Carolina Central University student, falsely accused three members of Duke University's men's lacrosse team of raping her at a party. Prior to Duke suspending its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, "I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game over a little thing like gang rape!" and "Why would you go to a cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?"[21] After the disbarment of District Attorney Mike Nifong, Attorney General Roy Cooper pronounced all three players innocent of the rape charges made by Mangum and Nifong.[22] On the following broadcast of her show, Grace did not appear and a substitute reporter, Jane Velez-Mitchell, announced the removal of all charges.[23]
In September 2006, 22-year-old Melinda Duckett committed suicide following an interview conducted by Grace concerning the disappearance of Duckett's 2-year-old son Trenton.[24] Grace interviewed Duckett less than two weeks after the child went missing, questioning her for her alleged lack of openness regarding her son's disappearance, asking Duckett "Where were you? Why aren't you telling us where you were that day?"[25] Duckett appeared confused and was unable to answer whether or not she had taken a polygraph test. When Grace asked her why she could not account for specific details, Duckett began to reply, "Because I was told not to," to which Grace responded, "Ms. Duckett, you are not telling us for a reason. What is the reason? You refuse to give even the simplest facts of where you were with your son before he went missing. It is day twelve." According to the CNN transcript, Duckett replied, "(INAUDIBLE) with all media. It's not just there, just all media. Period." Grace then moved on to a psychologist who asserted that Duckett was "skirting around the issue."[24][25]
The next day, before the airing of the show, Duckett shot herself, a death that relatives claim was influenced by media scrutiny, particularly from Grace.[24][26] Speaking to The Orlando Sentinel, Duckett's grandfather Bill Eubank said, "Nancy Grace and the others, they just bashed her to the end. She was not one anyone ever would have thought of to do something like this."[24] CNN has also been criticized for allowing the show to air in the wake of Duckett's suicide.[27] Police investigating the case had not named Melinda Duckett as a suspect in the case at the time, but after her suicide the police did say that, as nearly all parents are in missing-child cases, she was a suspect from the beginning.[24]
In an interview on Good Morning America, Nancy Grace said in reaction to events that "If anything, I would suggest that guilt made her commit suicide. To suggest that a 15- or 20-minute interview can cause someone to commit suicide is focusing on the wrong thing."[28] She then said that, while she sympathized with the family, she knew from her own experience as a victim of crime that such people look for somebody else to blame.[29]
While describing it as an "extremely sad development," Janine Iamunno, a spokeswoman for Grace,[24] said that her program would continue to follow the case as they had a "responsibility to bring attention to this case in the hopes of helping find Trenton Duckett." Grace commented that "I do not feel that our show is to blame for what happened to Melinda Duckett. The truth is not always nice or polite or easy to go down. Sometimes it's harsh, and it hurts."[24]
On November 21, 2006, The Smoking Gun exposed pending litigation on behalf of the estate of Melinda Duckett, asserting a wrongful death claim against CNN and Grace. The attorney for the estate alleges that, even if Duckett did kill her own son, Grace's aggressive questioning traumatized Duckett so much that she committed suicide. She also argues that CNN's decision to air the interview after Duckett's suicide traumatized her family. Trenton has never been found.[27][30]
On November 8, 2010, Grace reached a settlement with the estate of Melinda Duckett to create a $200,000 trust fund dedicated to locating Trenton. This settlement was reached a month before a jury trial was scheduled to start. According to the agreement, if the young boy is found alive before he turns 13, the remaining proceeds in the trust will be administered by a trustee – Trenton's great-aunt Kathleen Calvert – until he turns 18 and the funds are transferred for his use. If Trenton is not found by his 13th birthday, or if he is found but is not alive, the funds will be transferred immediately to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. "We are pleased the lawsuit has been dismissed. The statement speaks for itself," a spokeswoman for CNN said.[31]
From 2008 to 2011 the Caylee Anthony disappearance and the prosecution, trial and acquittal of her mother Casey Anthony on charges of murder of the child were a regular feature of the Nancy Grace show. She would reveal every new detail of the story.[32] Her program is cited as having "almost single-handedly inflated the Anthony case from a routine local murder into a national obsession".[33] Nancy Grace referred to Casey Anthony as the "tot mom," a phrase Elizabeth Flock in The Washington Post described as "almost derisive-sounding."[34]
The Nancy Grace audience more than doubled in the weeks after the start of the Casey Anthony trial.[35] David Carr wrote that Grace took her show to the trial scene in Orlando, Florida in order to "hurl invective from a close, intimate distance."[11] Grace expressed rage at Anthony's acquittal right after announcement of the verdict, saying: "Tot Mom's lies seem to have worked."[33] In a press conference after the verdicts were read, Cheney Mason, one of Anthony's defense attorneys, blamed the media for a "media assassination" which led to public hatred toward Anthony. He also said: "I can tell you that my colleagues from coast to coast and border to border have condemned this whole process of lawyers getting on television and talking about cases that they don't know a damn thing about, and don't have the experience to back up their words or the law to do it."[36]
Grace took it personally and responded, "What does he care about what pundits are saying?" Stating she had as much legal experience as Mason, she criticized the defense attorneys for taking on the media before mentioning Caylee's name in their news conference and stated that "[T]here is no way that this is a verdict that speaks the truth."[36]
Michelle Zierler, director of the Project in Law and Journalism at New York Law School said Grace "is always certain that the defendant is guilty and needs instant punishment" and this had affected her analysis of the case.[36] Howard Finkelstein, the Broward County, Florida public defender said "Nancy Grace should offend every journalist out there. These lawyers on TV during the Anthony trial only offered one side, everybody believed them, and now you've got a big chunk of the population that thinks the legal system let them down. Every time that happens, you lose part of the national community."[33]
On the day Anthony was sentenced on misdemeanor counts of lying to investigators, a supporter held a sign reading: "Nancy Grace, stop trying to ruin innocent lives. The jury has spoken. P.S. Our legal system still works!"[37]
In a televised appearance with media expert Dan Abrams, Grace stated about Anthony's being freed from jail that "No one wishes for vigilante justice; nobody advocates that. People who are opposed to the jury verdict, that think it was wrong, are really seeking justice, and I do not believe those people are interested in harming Tot Mom Casey Anthony." Abrams commented that "There are too many people out there who love Nancy Grace, who watch Nancy Grace on a regular basis, who are going to see [Anthony] out there somewhere and are going to give her a very, very hard time wherever she goes."[38]
Mainstream media have suggested that Grace made "wildly speculative" allegations on her program that the investigation into Whitney Houston's death should include the possibility that someone may have been responsible for drowning Houston. Some reporters have pointed out that Grace should have waited for the coroner's report before making this allegation.[39]
Toni Annette Medrano was infamously dubbed the "vodka mom" by Grace, who brought a bottle of vodka onto her set and poured shots to demonstrate how much Medrano had drank.[40] On November 22, 2011, Medrano accidentally killed her 3-week-old son, Adrian Alexander Medrano, while she was sleeping on the couch with him. According to the criminal complaint, Medrano told police she had consumed almost an entire fifth of vodka the night before her son died and fell asleep with him on a couch. The following morning, she woke up and found her infant son unresponsive and cold to the touch. In June 2012, Medrano was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter. If convicted on both counts, Medrano would have faced a maximum of 10 years in prison.
"The baby is dead because of vodka mommy," Grace said during her June 11 show on HLN. "I don't care if she was driving a car, holding a pistol or holding a fifth of vodka. [It] doesn't matter to me. The baby is dead at the hands of the mommy." During the show, Grace said the charges filed against Medrano weren't harsh enough. "I don't see how this whole thing was an accident and I want murder charges," Grace said.[41]
Medrano committed suicide by setting herself on fire, after being condemned by Grace.[42] Following Melinda Duckett's suicide, this is the second suicide to which Grace has been linked.[43] On January 4, 2012, a lawsuit against CNN brought by Medrano's family was settled, "I can tell you the case was settled in principle two weeks ago," said personal injury attorney Michael Padden. A lawsuit was never formally served but "we resolved the case just by negotiation," he said.[44]
Grace commented on the Amanda Knox case: "I was very disturbed, because I think it is a huge miscarriage of justice. I believe that while Amanda Knox did not wield the knife herself, I think that she was there, with her boyfriend, and that he did the deed, and that she egged him on. That's what I think happened.....I just happen to know the facts...I'm not trying to get Amanda Knox's first interview because… my show does not pay for interviews...Second, I don't think she's going to tell the truth anyway, so what's the point?"[45]
Following WWE Hall of Famer The Ultimate Warrior's April 8, 2014 death, Nancy Grace invited retired wrestler Diamond Dallas Page on her show to discuss Warrior. Unbeknownst to Page,[46] the subject of the episode was deaths in the sports entertainment industry caused by steroids. Grace claimed that "rumors of steroid and drug use are swirling" in the case of Ultimate Warrior's death,[47][48] although an autopsy had concluded that Warrior had died of natural causes with neither drugs nor alcohol in his system at his time of death.[49] During the segment Grace made several mentions to a list of wrestlers who had died young, linking their deaths to drug abuse. The list included wrestlers whose deaths were unrelated to drug abuse.[47]
A petition on Change.org requesting CNN to remove Nancy Grace from television received over 10,000 signatures within 24 hours,[50][51] and #CancelNancyGrace became a trending topic on Twitter following the episode's airing.[46] Page released a statement after episode aired, stating that he was under the assumption that he would be sharing stories in Warrior's memory and didn't know that steroids would be the only topic discussed.[46][52] WWE subsequently asked past and present WWE talent to not appear on Grace's HLN show.[53] Nancy Grace responded to criticism by telling Radar Online that she would welcome any WWE personalities to come onto her show to "correct all of my misconceptions".[54]
Grace's first work of fiction,[citation needed] The Eleventh Victim, also published by Hyperion, was released on August 11, 2009. The mystery thriller follows a young psychology student, Hailey Dean, whose fiancé is murdered just weeks before their wedding. She goes on to prosecute violent crime and is forced to reckon with what she left behind.[55] Publishers Weekly described it as "less than compelling."[56] A second novel, Death on the D-List, was published on August 10, 2010.
In April 2007, Grace married David Linch, an Atlanta investment banker, in a small private ceremony. The two had met while she was studying at Mercer University in the 1970s. Grace, who had given up on marriage after the death of her fiancé, said, "We've been in touch all these years, and a lot of time, we were separated by geography and time. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision to get married. I told my family only two days before the wedding."[57]
On June 26, 2007, an emotional Grace announced on her HLN talk show that her life had "taken a U-turn" in that she was pregnant and expecting twins due in January 2008.[58][59] Lucy Elizabeth and John David were born in November 2007.
In March 2006, an article in the New York Observer suggested that in her book Objection!, Grace had embellished the story of her college fiancé's 1979 murder and the ensuing trial to make it better support her image. Grace has described the tragedy as the impetus for her career as a prosecutor and victims' rights advocate, and has often publicly referred to the incident.[60] The Observer researched the murder and found several apparent contradictions between the events and Grace's subsequent statements, including the following:
Her fiancé, Keith Griffin, was shot not at random by a stranger, but by a former coworker, Tommy McCoy.
McCoy did not have a prior criminal record and, rather than denying the crime, confessed on the night of the murder.
There was no ongoing string of appeals (McCoy's family did not want any). McCoy has only once filed a habeas petition, which was rejected.
Grace told the Observer she had not looked into the case in many years and "tried not to think about it."[60] She said she made her previous statements about the case "with the knowledge I had."[60]
In response to Keith Olbermann's claims in a March 2007 Rolling Stone interview in which he was quoted as saying, "Anybody who would embellish the story of their own fiancé's murder should spend that hour a day not on television but in a psychiatrist's chair,"[61] Grace stated, "I did not put myself through law school and fight for all those years for victims of crime to waste one minute of my time, my energy, and my education in a war of words with Keith Olbermann, whom I've never met nor had any disagreement. I feel we have X amount of time on Earth, and that when we give in to our detractors or spend needless time on silly fights, I think that's abusing the chance we have to do something good."[61]
Griffin's murderer, Tommy McCoy, was released on parole from the Georgia Department of Corrections on December 5, 2006.[62]
Grace was a contestant on the thirteenth season of Dancing with the Stars, which began airing on September 19, 2011. She was partnered with pro-dancer Tristan MacManus. The couple lasted for 8 weeks and placed 5th overall in the competition before being eliminated on November 8, 2011, just one week shy of the semi-finals.
In early April 2012, Grace appeared on the 2 last episodes of the second season of the TV show Raising Hope playing herself. It was the first time Nancy Grace was seen playing a comic character on television.
The Law & Order programs often base their fictional stories on real-life events and have featured stories based on Grace on several occasions.[63]
In the episode "Haystack" of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, an overzealous reporter named Cindy Marino (played by Kali Rocha) causes the mother of a kidnapped son to commit suicide.[64]
On Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Grace has also been compared to a character named Faith Yancy (Geneva Carr) who hosts a similar talk show (Inside American Justice) that sensationalizes whatever case the main characters are working on and makes it difficult for them to gain access to key witnesses. Although, the character could be based on any number of individuals with this type of show. The character has appeared on the episodes "In the Wee Small Hours" (original air date November 6, 2005), "Masquerade" (original air date October 31, 2006), "Albatross" (original air date February 6, 2007), "Neighborhood Watch" (original air date August 10, 2008), and "Lady's Man" (original air date June 28, 2009).[65]
On May 22, 2007, Grace appeared in the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode "Screwed" the season 8 finale, playing herself opposite Star Jones.[66]
Episode eight of The Newsroom, "The Blackout Part I: Tragedy Porn", features a scene in which the newsroom staff dismantle Grace's coverage of the Casey Anthony case.[67]
Shelby Cross, a recurring character appearing on the Onion News Network, a parody of cable news shows produced by The Onion, is a parody of Grace's confrontational, sensationalistic style and tendency to immediately assume the guilt of criminal suspects. Cross also engaged in a variety of unethical activities, such as burglarizing a suspect's home (and wantonly destroying their possessions) in search of "evidence" the police may have missed, and fomenting suspicion of men of Middle Eastern decent, even encouraging viewers to build "Justice Sheds" in their back yards to confine alleged terrorists.

=======================================================
Every crime-fighting superhero has a creation story. Nancy Grace, the prosecutor turned breakout star at CNN Headline News, has a particularly moving one. As she tells it, in the summer of 1980, she was a 19-year-old college student in small-town Georgia, engaged to Keith Griffin, a star third baseman for the Valdosta State University Blazers. The wedding was a few months away.
Then, one August morning, a stranger—a 24-year-old thug with a history of being on the wrong side of the law—accosted Griffin outside a convenience store. He shot him five times in the head and back, stole $35 from his wallet, and left him dead.
Police soon tracked down the killer, and a new phase of suffering began for Ms. Grace. The suspect brazenly denied any involvement. At trial, Ms. Grace testified, then waited as jury deliberations dragged on for three days. The district attorney asked her if she wanted the death penalty, and in a moment of youthful weakness, she said no. The verdict came back guilty—life in prison—and a string of appeals ensued.
For Nancy Grace, the ordeal she describes felt nothing like justice. And so the Shakespeare-loving teen set out to change the justice system: first as a bulldog prosecutor, then as a Court TV and CNN anchor, crusader for victims’ rights and professional vilifier of the criminal-defense industry.
Her message, delivered with a crackling blend of folksiness and wrath, has made her a hit on two cable networks. Defense attorneys are pigs—morally comparable, she said in a Feb. 20 interview with USA Today, to “guards at Auschwitz.” Her latest show, Nancy Grace, celebrated its first anniversary on CNN’s Headline News Network that week; in one year, its viewership has tripled, to 606,000 a night.
Because of what happened in Georgia, Ms. Grace has said over and over, she knows firsthand how the system favors hardened criminals over victims. It is the foundation of her judicial philosophy, her motivation in life, her casus belli.
Nancy Grace was engaged to a man named Keith Griffin. He was murdered in Georgia. And the man who killed him is serving a life sentence. In that, Ms. Grace’s version lines up with the official records from the Georgia Bureau of Investigations, newspaper articles from the time of the murder, and interviews with many of those involved in the case.
But those same sources contradict Ms. Grace when it comes to other salient facts of the crime and the trial—the facts that form the basis of Ms. Grace’s crusade against an impotent, criminal-coddling legal system.
• Prosecutors asked for the death penalty, but didn’t get it, because Mr. McCoy was mildly retarded.
• Mr. McCoy never had an appeal; he filed a habeas application five years ago, and after a hearing it was rejected.
Ms. Grace has also misreported the date of the incident—it was in 1979, not 1980—and has given Griffin’s age as 25 when it was 23.
In an emotional phone interview ranging over the inconsistencies in her account, Ms. Grace said, “I have not researched the defendant. I have tried not to think about it.”
“She has bent some stuff,” said Steve Griffin, Keith Griffin’s brother, in an interview with The Observer. “The reality of it is, the guy killed him. I know that. Our family knows that. There’s nothing we can do to bring him back. What she’s gonna say, she’s gonna say. I’m not gonna stop it.
Nancy Grace anchors three hours of live television a day: two during the afternoon on Court TV’s Closing Arguments, then an hour of Nancy Grace on Headline News in the evening.
Before Nancy Grace, Headline News was exactly as it sounded—a virtually uninterrupted news-reading circuit of the day’s top stories. Then Ms. Grace joined the primetime lineup, fresh off an intense run of commentator and guest-host spots on Larry King Live.
Ms. Grace, who will not discuss her age, but according to official records is 46, comes across as the Bill O’Reilly of legal analysis, shutting down dissidents and cozying up to the likeminded, whom she addresses collectively as “friend.” She is a self-identified advocate for victims’ rights, with a taste for cases of the missing-white-woman variety.
And she rarely lets a week pass without reminding viewers of her own history. During her Feb. 24 show, she brought it to bear on the spokesperson for Jennifer Hagel-Smith, a bride whose husband disappeared during their honeymoon cruise.
“Why does Jennifer Hagel-Smith need a P.R. person?” she asked. “I’m a crime victim. I didn’t need a P.R. person. Why does she need a P.R. person?”
Ms. Grace’s accusatory style makes for gripping, if not always judicious, television. (Regarding the Auschwitz quote, Ms. Grace offered an explanation on the phone: “Under no condition is a defense attorney equal to a Nazi guard. That’s just an extreme example of someone refusing to take responsibility.”) In February, Ms. Grace’s staff was ordered to attend a three-hour workshop on reporting basics to help remedy “lax journalistic standards,” according to a CNN source. The session covered issues such as the meaning of “off the record” and the number of sources it takes to confirm a piece of information.
“[E]very editorial employee is expected to attend these seminars, as part of CNN’s standard training,” CNN publicist Janine Iamunno wrote in an e-mail. Ms. Grace did not attend—because, Ms. Iamunno explained, “she had attended a previous seminar.”
In her previous career, as an assistant district attorney in Atlanta from 1987 to 1996, Ms. Grace was cited three times for sloppy trial practices. She argued hundreds of jury trials and never lost one—another chapter in her mythic back-story.
But in 2005, the 11th Circuit Court in Georgia declared that Ms. Grace had “played fast and loose” with facts in her 1990 triple-murder prosecution of Herbert Connell Stephens. In 1997, the Georgia Supreme Court overturned an arson-murder verdict, finding Ms. Grace had withheld evidence from the defense; in 1994, the same court had overturned her conviction of a heroin trafficker, finding problems with her closing argument.
Her courtroom style made a more positive impression, however, on Court TV founder Steven Brill. Mr. Brill plucked her out of an Atlanta courtroom in 1996. At his behest, as the story goes, she moved to New York with two suitcases, $200 and a curling iron, to co-host a show with Johnnie Cochran.
“With every case that I prosecuted,” she told Tim Russert in June 2005, “every bad person I put away, it healed me. And looking back on it, I thought I was trying to help them, but I was really helping me.”
Through a spokesperson, CNN NewsGroup vice president Ken Jautz offered a written endorsement of Ms. Grace’s performance: “Nothing changes the fact that Nancy suffered a tremendous personal tragedy when she was 19 years old, with the murder of her fiancé—a trauma that shaped who she is today. While some details may be able to be clarified in the over 25 years since the case, they do not [bear] any significance on Nancy’s career as a prosecutor, victims’ advocate or television host. We have great respect for Nancy and her willingness to draw upon this personal experience as she advocates for victims and enlightens all of us on her show every night.”
“NANCY’S ALWAYS BEEN TENDERHEARTED,” said her mother, Elizabeth Grace. “She comes across as being so strong, but deep down, she has a lot of soft spots.”
By any standard, the murder of Keith Griffin shook Ms. Grace badly. She dropped out of college for a while, stopped eating and lost 30 pounds. She abandoned her plans to become an English professor and enrolled in Mercer University Law School, on her way to becoming a prosecutor.
Growing up, Elizabeth Grace said, her daughter had applied her tenacity to interior-design projects for her local 4-H club. She made little rooms out of particleboard and glued squares of carpet to the bottom. “She was always very competitive,” the elder Ms. Grace said.
Keith Griffin and Ms. Grace had been college sweethearts for more than two years when he proposed in the summer of 1979. Griffin planned to be a geologist, and was earning extra college money working for the Ingram Construction Co. on the Georgia Kraft Plywood Co. site near Madison, Ga. The engagement was a secret—only Griffin’s sister, Judy, knew about it—but the families approved of their relationship. Ms. Grace’s family thought Griffin was polite and charming; Griffin’s parents adored Ms. Grace. Griffin’s brother Steve, 13 months his junior, was the unimpressed one. “I thought she was a dingbat,” he said.
Then came Aug. 6. Griffin woke at 5 a.m. in the Grace home, where he’d spent the night in an extra room, and left for work. Ms. Grace’s mother said her daughter tucked some money in his hand before he left.
“I waved until he was nearly out of sight, because I’ve always heard that watching until someone is out of sight is bad luck,” Ms. Grace wrote in her autobiography, Objection!
At 8:30 that morning, Tommy McCoy, recently fired from his job at Ingram, went to his father’s house and took a pistol from the bedroom closet, according to the transcript of his confession given to two agents at the Morgan County Sheriff’s Department that evening. He wrapped the gun in a paper bag and hitched a ride with the family’s insurance man to his grandmother’s house, where he stayed until 11:15 a.m. Then he started walking toward Georgia Kraft.
WHAT HAPPENED TO KEITH GRIFFIN THAT DAY, Ms. Grace told Tim Russert in 2005, was this: “[H]e was, I guess you would say, mugged by someone—he didn’t even know him—and shot five times.”
Ms. Grace also told Mr. Russert, “The man that murdered Keith was a repeat offender, and I thought the system had failed Keith.”
She had given the same message to a New York Times reporter in 2004: “The person that murdered Keith had several incidents with the law, and somebody let him slip through their fingers.”
And she told it to Larry King in 2003: “This perpetrator had been in and out of trouble. And I always wonder, if someone had cared about the case—not necessarily throw them behind bars and toss the key, but to rehab the person, or to throw them behind bars, to get him off the street.”
Nancy Grace’s stated mission has been to prevent that sort of mistake from being made again. “I am the system,” she declared to CNN’s Art Harris in a 1995 interview, when she was still a prosecutor. “I am part of the system, and it failed that time, and I hate to see it ever fail again.”
Yet it’s unclear when the system could have ever had a chance to lock up Mr. McCoy before the murder. According to his personal-history sheet, he had never been convicted of a crime. Ms. Grace noted in a written follow-up that Mr. McCoy could have had a sealed juvenile record.
On the phone, Ms. Grace said she recalled having been told “by an official” that “this young man had been in and out of trouble and that his own family had been afraid of him.” But she could not recall which official might have said that.
ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO TRIED THE CASE, as well as Mr. McCoy’s confession, the two men were not strangers, and nobody disputed who did the killing.
“He knew him, of course,” said Billy Prior, Mr. McCoy’s defense attorney. Griffin had seen Mr. McCoy walking and offered him a ride.
“[T]hat dude came up in a truck,” Mr. McCoy told police, according to the notes on his confession. “It was a blue truck, and it belongs to the man I used to work for. The boss wasn’t in it, and the guy that was in it was a white dude from Athens who worked with me for a while. He drove up next to where I was standing, and stopped the truck. He said, ‘Hello, Tommy, how are you?’”
Mr. McCoy then unloaded six rounds from his .38-caliber pistol. He took $10 from Griffin’s wallet and threw the wallet in the truck. The truck rolled into a ditch on the side of the road. Just then, Joe Brown, another employee of Ingram Construction, pulled up to see if Mr. McCoy needed help. Mr. McCoy trained the empty pistol on him, forced him out of his car, jumped in and drove off. “I shot that dude because he was one of the ones that got me fired from my job,” he said in his confession. “I went out there to get revenge because I had been fired.”
In her biography, Ms. Grace writes, “My deep-seated ethical problem with defense attorneys likely traces back to my being a witness in Keith’s murder trial …. The truth really doesn’t matter to the defense.”
In 2003, Ms. Grace told Larry King that the killer’s defense had been “Didn’t do it, wrong guy. Wrong place, wrong time.”
Mr. Prior laughed on hearing Ms. Grace’s quote comparing defense attorneys to Nazis. “I guess I’m where she got her idea,” he said. Mr. Prior is now a Superior Court judge in Morgan County and a fan of the Nancy Grace show.
But back in 1979, a mistaken-identity defense for Mr. McCoy would have had to overcome not only the confession but the testimony of Joe Brown, who had happened across the scene.
The most the defense could muster, Mr. Prior said, was a psychiatric evaluation, in which a doctor from the Georgia Central State Hospital declared Mr. McCoy “mildly retarded,” according to court documents.
“I don’t think I ever made a formal plea of insanity, because I couldn’t get a psychiatrist to say he was insane,” Mr. Prior said. “I did play on the mental-retardation thing. That was my only card.”
The district attorney who prosecuted the case, Joe Briley, is a longtime friend of Mr. Prior’s. Mr. Briley said he doesn’t care for Ms. Grace’s show. “I started to watch it one night,” he said, “but I don’t like the format. I knew right off that I didn’t like the format. I said, ‘I believe I’ll go watch a John Wayne movie or something.’”
Neither man recalled Nancy Grace as a pivotal figure at the trial. Mr. Briley faintly remembered asking her to identify Griffin’s wallet. “I don’t think she did anything to demark herself on the witness stand,” Mr. Briley said, “or I would have remembered.”
Ms. Grace offers vivid memories of the trial in her book. “The cavernous courtroom reminded me of the one in To Kill a Mockingbird,” she writes. She describes looking down at Tommy McCoy from the witness chair, some six feet off the ground.
Where did she get the claim that Mr. McCoy had denied the killing? “Upon his arrest, I was told he said he didn’t do it,” Ms. Grace said. “He may have confessed at some juncture, but I was told that he initially said he didn’t do it.”
Columbus Johnson, the deputy sheriff who arrested Mr. McCoy and took him to jail in 1979, is now a captain in his 34th year with the department. “He didn’t open his mouth the whole way,” Mr. Johnson said. “He never said anything to me or the other officers that transported him.”
Asked if she had checked her memory against the official documents before writing the book and giving the interviews, Ms. Grace said, “I wrote about everything with the knowledge I had.”
The trial wrapped up quickly—not with three days of deliberations, as Ms. Grace described, but with one. Mr. McCoy was convicted of aggravated assault and murder, and acquitted of robbery.
Mr. Briley said he had no recollection of Ms. Grace’s dramatic, now-regretted decision not to ask for the death penalty in the sentencing phase. Rather than asking the family if they wanted to pursue death, he said, his practice was to tell them his plan and see if they supported it. “If she had been introduced by the family, and this may have been what happened, as his fiancée, then I would have included her in the conversation,” he said.
In any event, Mr. Briley did put in for the death penalty, in a letter on Oct. 3, 1979—saying the murder “was outrageously wanton or vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.”
The jury recommended life in prison. Both attorneys said they believe this to have been because Mr. McCoy was demonstrably slow-witted. “He was not very bright,” Mr. Briley said.
When the verdict was read, Mr. McCoy turned to Mr. Prior. “He asked me, ‘What does it mean?’” Mr. Prior said. “I told him it meant he was not going to the electric chair.”
Mr. McCoy has been in prison for 27 years now. “He did not appeal his case,” Mr. Prior said. “His family did not want to appeal.”
Five years ago, Mr. McCoy filed a habeas application with the state. “It’s not an appeal,” Mr. Prior said. “It’s a writ claiming he’s being illegally held.” Mr. Prior testified at a hearing, and the application was denied. He appears likely to remain behind bars for the rest of his life.
Ms. Grace, meanwhile, plans to continue her crusade. Even if the facts don’t exactly line up. Even if it’s starting to worry her mother.
I love The Nancy Grace show. She is very strong willed to see that Justice is served! I admire her and her determination!

Headline News anchor Nancy Grace and her husband David Linch welcomed twins Lucy Elizabeth and John David on Sunday – an early delivery for Grace, who had developed a pulmonary edema during the pregnancy.
"Her physician determined it would be best for Nancy, and for the twins, to deliver them [on Sunday]," a rep for Grace said. "Lucy Elizabeth, John David, and their proud parents are now resting comfortably."John David weighed 5 lbs., 1 oz. at birth, and Lucy Elizabeth weighed 2 lbs., 15 oz. according to the rep. Grace, 48, had been due to give birth in January, PEOPLE reported this summer.
"The babies are doing fine. Our little girl is doing just as well as her brother despite her weight – and mom is doing great," Linch tells PEOPLE.
Pulmonary edema involves swelling and/or fluid accumulation in the lungs. No further details were given about Grace's condition, or that of the twins, on Monday.
According to Grace's rep, John David is named for his father and John the Revelator. Lucy Elizabeth is named after Grace's mother Elizabeth and grandmother Lucy.
Last month Grace was feted at a baby shower in Manhattan hosted by good pal and former Court TV colleague Diane Dimond. Linch and a host of pals, including Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lisa Bloom, attended and brought gifts such as a pair of his and hers cowboy booties for the twins to match mom's signature pair.

An outspoken, tireless advocate for victims rights and one of television's most respected legal analysts, Nancy Grace is the powerful force behind Headline News (HLN) top-rated Nancy Grace. A former prosecutor with an unparalleled record of success, she has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The View, The Today Show, Good Morning America, Dr. Phil and Larry King Live, among others, dispensing her firebrand take on the modern justice system. Graces first book, Objection!, was published in 2005 and became an instant New York Times bestseller.  Her two subsequent novels, The Eleventh Victim (2009) and Death on the D-List (2010), were also New York Times bestsellers, and a television movie adaptation of The Eleventh Victim is currently in development.  Grace is an executive producer on the film project.  She is the recipient of several American Women in Radio & Television Gracie Awards for her Nancy Grace Investigates primetime report on Court TV and has been awarded the "Individual Achievement/Best Program Host" honor.  Grace has also been widely recognized by many notable organizations (including the Carole Sund/Carrington Foundation, Crime Victims United of California and The Retreat) for her advocacy work on behalf of victims rights. Graces life changed forever in 1979 when her then-fiancé, Keith Griffin, was shot and killed.  In the aftermath of that crime, Nancy abandoned plans to become an English professor and turned her focus to criminal justice.  She became a Law Review graduate of Mercer Law School and received her degree in constitutional and criminal law from New York University.  Additionally, she donated her time to help staff the hotline at an Atlanta battered women's center for over 10 years.  Nancy Grace initially came to television from the Atlanta Fulton County District Attorney's Office, where she served more than a decade as a special prosecutor of felony cases involving murder, rape, child molestation and arson.  Known for her authentic sensibility and for not holding back her opinion on high-profile cases, she was tapped to host Court TVs live daily trial coverage program, Closing Arguments, and later to co-host Cochran and Grace.  She also presided over the daytime hit Swift Justice with Nancy Grace, for which she received an Emmy Award nomination. 2007 saw Graces marriage to long-time sweetheart, David.  In a recent interview she said, After I lost my fiancé, it seemed like it would be better to always be alone than to risk being hurt again. I thought God had closed that door and given me my career instead.  But then someone came into my life, and I realized: this is worth the risk.   Another life milestone followed  the birth of twins John David and Lucy.  These babies are my miracles, she says.  Now, everything important in Graces life  including her unwavering crusade for true justice  comes back to family.  Since her marriage and the birth of her children, Nancy says, I feel even more passionate about fighting for victims. Nancy Grace, her husband and her twins reside in Atlanta and New York City.

Tough-talking newswoman Nancy Grace lets down her guard about the man she finally married, her struggle to become a mom, and why these babies are her miracles
Television journalist Nancy Grace is holding her infant twins, and it's getting hard to stop the crying. As she sits in a rocking chair in her Manhattan apartment, she cradles little John David in her right arm and Lucy Elizabeth in her left. Luckily, both babies seem oblivious to the waterworks; they're still soundly sleeping. It's Grace who can't keep from sobbing.  
"Oh, I'm so sorry," she says, sniffling. "I just...I still can't believe they're here, you know? I can't believe they're mine and that this is my life. I just never believed this could happen to me."  
In fact, given Grace's professional reputation, most of her fans would be surprised by the cozy domesticity of this scene. Born in Macon, GA  and speaking with a drawl that turns her last name into "Gryce"  Grace has always been more steel magnolia than Southern belle. A former special prosecutor in her home state, Grace, 48, eventually found a new career on cable, hosting a current-affairs show in which she tackles breaking legal news. But what has made her truly famous, first on Court TV and now on CNN, is her on-air demeanor, which ranges from aggressive to accusatory as she delves into high-profile cases. An outspoken media fixture during Michael Jackson's trial, Natalee Holloway's disappearance, and Anna Nicole Smith's death, she has made headlines for her willingness to condemn alleged perpetrators before they've been found guilty. But her hard-edged style has won her as many fans as detractors. Her intensity, she says, stems from a deep and personal connection to crime victims. When Grace was 19, her world was shattered when her fiancé, Keith Griffin, was brutally shot and killed by a coworker. The experience inspired her to go to law school and crusade for victims' rights. But, she says now, it also led her to shut down emotionally.  
"After I lost my fiancé, it seemed like it would be better to always be alone than to risk being hurt again," she says. "So I felt being a wife and mother just wasn't going to happen for me. I thought God had closed that door and given me my career instead. But then someone came into my life, and I realized: This is worth the risk."  
That someone was David Linch, 49, an Atlanta-based investment banker whom Grace first met in the 1970s when they both attended Mercer College in Atlanta. Over the years, the two had kept in touch, but it was only a little more than a year ago that they became romantically involved and then, somewhat impulsively, decided to wed. "I told my family only two days before the wedding," says Grace. Red-eyed now from tears and tiredness, she hands off the twins to a nanny and sips from a cup of coffee. "I just never dreamed I could love someone so much  and have someone love me back so much."  
Shortly after they married, Grace and Linch discussed starting a family. Grace refuses to specify what methods might have led to a pregnancy in her late 40s; Lucy and John David, she feels, should be the first to hear about how they were conceived. "Also, on behalf of women everywhere who have gone through fertility treatments, it is my firm belief that what happens between your legs is nobody's business but your own. Let me say this: They are my children. They look like me and my husband, and I can only hope that they get the best of our qualities."  
While she won't talk about how she got pregnant, Grace does open up about how grueling, and life threatening, it was to carry her babies.  
"It was just such a roller-coaster ride, from the very beginning," she says. "First, right after I found out it was twins, I had an ultrasound where they couldn't find the second heartbeat anymore." She shudders at the memory. "For over a week, I had to go around thinking that there was just one of them, and I was heartbroken. Then at another appointment, all of a sudden, they found the heartbeat again. I just ran home and e-mailed David, Our twins are back.' It was so incredible."  
But the pregnancy was fraught with complications, from extremely high blood pressure to breathing difficulties, and Grace landed in the hospital five times. "I just wasn't prepared for how much a pregnancy in your 40s knocks you on your butt. It was one thing after another," she says. "At one point, in August, I thought I was going into early labor...while on vacation with my mother on some tiny island off the coast of Florida. I was in the back of this rural ambulance, on a three-hour ride to the nearest hospital. The driver was named Elvis, and I remember lying there thinking: This is not happening. I am not about to give birth in the back of Elvis's truck."
