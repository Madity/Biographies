=======================================================
William James "Bill" O'Reilly, Jr. (born September 10, 1949) is an American television host, author, syndicated columnist and political commentator.[2] He is the host of the political commentary program The O'Reilly Factor on the Fox News Channel.[3][4][5] During the late 1970s and 1980s, he worked as a news reporter for various local television stations in the United States and eventually for CBS News and ABC News. From 1989 to 1995, he was anchor of the entertainment news program Inside Edition.
O'Reilly is widely considered a conservative commentator,[6][7][8] though some of his positions diverge from conservative orthodoxy.[9][10] O'Reilly is a registered "Independent" (See: Political views of Bill O'Reilly) and characterizes himself as a "traditionalist".[11][12] O'Reilly is the author of ten books, and hosted The Radio Factor until early 2009.[13]
O'Reilly was born on September 10, 1949, at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City to parents William James, Sr., (deceased) and Winifred Angela Drake O'Reilly, from Brooklyn and Teaneck, New Jersey, respectively.[14] Bill O'Reilly's ancestors on his father's side lived in County Cavan, Ireland, since the early eighteenth century, and those on his mother's side were from Northern Ireland.[15] The O'Reilly family lived in a small apartment in Fort Lee, New Jersey, when their son was born.[16] In 1951 his family moved to Levittown, on Long Island.[17] O'Reilly has a sister, Janet.
He attended St. Brigid parochial school in Westbury, and Chaminade High School, a private Catholic boys high school in Mineola. His father wanted him to attend Chaminade, but Bill wanted to attend W. Tresper Clarke High School, the public school most of his closest friends would attend.[18] Bill O'Reilly played Little League baseball and was the goalie on the Chaminade varsity hockey team.[19] During his high school years, O'Reilly met future pop-singer icon Billy Joel, whom O'Reilly described as a "hoodlum." O'Reilly recollected in an interview with Michael Kay on the YES Network show CenterStage that Joel "was in the Hicksville section—the same age as me—and he was a hood. He used to slick it [his hair] back like this. And we knew him, because his guys would smoke and this and that, and we were more jocks."[20]
After graduating from high school in 1967, O'Reilly attended Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, his father's choice.[21] While at Marist, O'Reilly played punter in the National Club Football Association[22] and was also a writer for the school's newspaper, The Circle. An honors student, he majored in history. He spent his junior year of college abroad, attending Queen Mary College at the University of London.[23] O'Reilly received his bachelor of arts degree in history in 1971.[24] He played semi-professional baseball during this time as a pitcher for the New York Monarchs.[25] After graduating from Marist College at age 21, O'Reilly moved to Miami, Florida, where he taught English and history at Monsignor Pace High School from 1970 to 1972.[26] O'Reilly returned to school in 1973[27] and earned a master of arts degree in broadcast journalism from Boston University.[24] While attending Boston University, he was a reporter and columnist for various local newspapers and alternative news weeklies, including The Boston Phoenix, and did an internship in the newsroom of WBZ-TV.[28] During his time at BU, O'Reilly also was a classmate of future radio talk show host Howard Stern, whom O'Reilly noticed because Stern was the only student on campus taller than he was.[20] In 1995, having established himself as a national media personality, O'Reilly was accepted to Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government; he received a master of public administration degree in 1996.[24] At Harvard, he was a student of Marvin Kalb.[29]
O'Reilly's early television news career included reporting and anchoring positions at WNEP-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he also reported the weather. At WFAA-TV in Dallas, O'Reilly was awarded the Dallas Press Club Award for excellence in investigative reporting. He then moved to KMGH-TV in Denver, where he won a local Emmy Award for his coverage of a skyjacking.[30] O'Reilly also worked for KATU in Portland, Oregon, WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut, and WNEV-TV (now WHDH-TV) in Boston.
In 1980 O'Reilly anchored the local news-feature program 7:30 Magazine at WCBS-TV in New York. Soon after, as a WCBS News anchor and correspondent, he won his second local Emmy, for an investigation of corrupt city marshals. In 1982 he was promoted to the network as a CBS News correspondent and covered the wars in El Salvador and the Falkland Islands from his base in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He later left CBS over a dispute concerning the uncredited use in a report by Bob Schieffer of riot footage shot by O'Reilly's crew in Buenos Aires during the Falklands conflict.[31]
O'Reilly joined ABC News as a correspondent in 1986. He delivered a eulogy for his friend Joe Spencer, an ABC News correspondent who died in a helicopter crash on January 22, 1986, en route to covering the Hormel meatpacker strike that day. ABC News president Roone Arledge, who attended Spencer's funeral, decided to hire O'Reilly after hearing his eulogy.[32] At ABC, O'Reilly hosted daytime news briefs that previewed stories to be reported on the day's World News Tonight and worked as a general assignment reporter for ABC News programs, including Good Morning America, Nightline, and World News Tonight.[33]
O'Reilly has stated that his interest and style in media came from several CBS and ABC personalities, including Mike Wallace, Howard Cosell, Dick Snyder and Peter Jennings.
In 1989 O'Reilly joined the nationally syndicated King World (now CBS Television Distribution)-produced Inside Edition, a tabloid/gossip television program in competition with A Current Affair.[24] He became the program's anchor three weeks into its run, after the termination of original anchor David Frost.[34] In addition to being one of the first American broadcasters to cover the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, O'Reilly also obtained the first exclusive interview with murderer Joel Steinberg and was the first television host from a national current affairs program on the scene of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Former NBC News and CBS News anchor Deborah Norville replaced O'Reilly on Inside Edition in 1995; O'Reilly had expressed a desire to quit the show in July 1994.[35] He then enrolled in September 1995 at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University,[36] where he received a master's degree in public administration.[24] His graduate thesis, which he researched in Singapore, was titled Theory of Coerced Drug Rehabilitation. In his thesis, O'Reilly asserted that supervised mandatory drug rehabilitation would reduce crime, based on the rate of prison return for criminals in Alabama who enrolled in such a program.[37]
After Harvard, he was hired by Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of the then startup Fox News Channel, to anchor The O'Reilly Report in October 1996.[38] The show was renamed The O'Reilly Factor, after O'Reilly's friend and branding expert John Tantillo's remarks upon the "O'Reilly Factor" in any of the stories O'Reilly told.[38][39][40] The program is routinely the highest-rated show of the three major U.S. 24-hour cable news television channels and began the trend toward more opinion-oriented prime-time cable news programming.[41] The show is taped late in the afternoon at a studio in New York City and airs every weekday on the Fox News Channel at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and is rebroadcast at 11:00 p.m.
Until early 2009, O'Reilly hosted a radio program that had more than 3.26 million listeners and was carried by more than 400 radio stations.[42] According to the talk radio industry publication Talkers Magazine, O'Reilly was No. 11 on the "Heavy Hundred," a list of the 100 most important talk show hosts in America.[43] Conservative Internet news site NewsMax's "Top 25 Talk Radio Host" list selected O'Reilly to the No. 2 spot as most influential host in the nation.[44]
O'Reilly's life and career have not been without controversy. Progressive media watchdog organizations such as Media Matters and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting have criticized O'Reilly's reporting on a variety of issues, accusing him of distorting facts and using misleading or erroneous statistics.[45]
After the September 11 attacks, O'Reilly accused the United Way of America and American Red Cross of failing to deliver millions of dollars in donated money, raised by the organizations in the name of the disaster, to the families of those killed in the attacks.[46] O'Reilly reported that the organizations misrepresented their intentions for the money being raised by not distributing all of the 9/11 relief fund to the victims. Actor George Clooney responded, accusing O'Reilly of misstating facts and harming the relief effort by inciting "panic" among potential donors.[47]
Beginning in 2005, O'Reilly periodically denounced George Tiller, a Kansas-based physician who specialized in second- and third-trimester abortions,[48] often referring to him as "Tiller the baby killer".[49] Tiller was murdered on May 31, 2009, by Scott Roeder, an anti-abortion activist.[50] Critics such as Salon.com's Gabriel Winant have asserted that O'Reilly's anti-Tiller rhetoric helped to create an atmosphere of violence around the doctor.[51] Jay Bookman of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that O'Reilly "clearly went overboard in his condemnation and demonization of Tiller" but added that it was "irresponsible to link O'Reilly" to Tiller's murder.[52] O'Reilly has responded to the criticism by saying "no backpedaling here ... every single thing we said about Tiller was true."[53]
In early 2007, researchers from the Indiana University School of Journalism published a report that analyzed O'Reilly's "Talking Points Memo" segment. Using analysis techniques developed in the 1930s by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, the study concluded that O'Reilly used propaganda, frequently engaged in name calling, and consistently cast non-Americans as threats and never "in the role of victim or hero."[54][55] O'Reilly responded, asserting that "the terms 'conservative,' 'liberal,' 'left,' 'right,' 'progressive,' 'traditional' and 'centrist' were considered name-calling if they were associated with a problem or social ill." The study's authors claimed that those terms were only considered name-calling when linked to derogatory qualifiers.[56] Fox News producer Ron Mitchell wrote an op-ed in which he accused the study's authors of seeking to manipulate their research to fit a predetermined outcome. Mitchell argued that by using tools developed for examining propaganda, the researchers presupposed that O'Reilly propagandized.[57]
O'Reilly is the main inspiration for comedian Stephen Colbert's satirical character on the Comedy Central show The Colbert Report, which features Colbert in a "full-dress parody" of The O'Reilly Factor. On the show, Colbert refers to O'Reilly as "Papa Bear."[58] O'Reilly and Colbert exchanged appearances on each other's shows in January 2007.[59]
Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America on March 18, 2003, O'Reilly promised that "[i]f the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean [of weapons of mass destruction] ... I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again."[60] In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, O'Reilly responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: "My analysis was wrong and I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm not pleased about it at all."[61] With regard to never again trusting the current U.S. government, he said, "I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at that time."
On May 10, 2008, O'Reilly was presented with the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Governors' Award at an Emmy awards show dinner.[62]
O'Reilly writes a weekly syndicated newspaper column through Creators Syndicate[63] that appears in numerous newspapers, including the New York Post and the Chicago Sun-Times.[64]
O'Reilly made cameo appearances in the films An American Carol, Iron Man 2 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon.[65][66][67]
On The O'Reilly Factor and on his former talk-radio program, Bill O'Reilly has focused on news and commentary related to politics and culture.[68] O'Reilly has long said that he does not identify with any political ideology, writing in his book The O'Reilly Factor that the reader "might be wondering whether I'm conservative, liberal, libertarian, or exactly what ... See, I don't want to fit any of those labels, because I believe that the truth doesn't have labels. When I see corruption, I try to expose it. When I see exploitation, I try to fight it. That's my political position."[69] On December 6, 2000, the Daily News in New York reported, however, that he had been registered with the Republican Party in the state of New York since 1994. When questioned about this, he said that he was not aware of it and says he registered as an independent after the interview.[70] During a broadcast of The Radio Factor, O'Reilly said that there was no option to register as an independent voter; however, there was in fact a box marked "I do not wish to enroll in party."[71] Despite being registered as an Independent, many view him as a conservative figure.[68] A February 2009 Pew Research poll found that 66% of his television viewers identify themselves as conservative, 24% moderate, and 3% liberal.[72] A November 2008 poll by Zogby International found that O'Reilly was the second most trusted news personality, after Rush Limbaugh.[73]
I'm not a political guy in the sense that I embrace an ideology. To this day I'm an independent thinker, an independent voter, I'm a registered independent ... [T]here are certain fundamental things that this country was founded upon that I respect and don't want changed. That separates me from the secularists who want a complete overhaul of how the country is run.[11]
On a September 2007 edition of The Radio Factor, while having a discussion about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia's restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." He commented that no one in Sylvia's was "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" He further added, "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'"[74] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is "ridiculous" and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is "nuts,"[75] and Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions.[76][77] O'Reilly responded, saying, "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" and also called out Media Matters, claiming that "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism."[78] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was "rank dishonesty" and that the original comments "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." Williams went on to say it was "frustrating" that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.[79]
O'Reilly has long said that his inspiration for speaking up for average Americans is his working-class roots. He has pointed to his boyhood home in Levittown, New York, as a credential. In an interview with The Washington Post, O'Reilly's mother said that her family lived in Westbury,[80][dead link] which is a few miles from Levittown. Citing this interview, then liberal talk-show pundit Al Franken accused O'Reilly of distorting his background to create a more working-class image. O'Reilly countered that The Washington Post misquoted his mother[81] and that his mother still lives in his childhood home, which was built by William Levitt. O'Reilly placed a copy of the house's mortgage on his website; the mortgage shows a Levittown postal address.[82] O'Reilly has also said, "You don't come from any lower than I came from on an economic scale"[83] and that his father, a currency accountant for an oil company,[84] "never earned more than $35,000 a year in his life." O'Reilly responded that his father's $35,000 income only came at the end of his long career.[85]
O'Reilly was married to Maureen E. McPhilmy, a public relations executive. They met in 1992, and their wedding took place in St. Brigid Parish of Westbury on November 2, 1996.[86] They have a daughter, Madeline (born 1998), and a son, Spencer (born 2003).[87]
The couple separated in April 2, 2010, and were divorced on September 1, 2011.[88] Each currently resides in suburban Manhasset, New York.
On August 27, 2002, O'Reilly called for all Americans to boycott Pepsi products,[89] saying that Ludacris's lyrics glamorize a "life of guns, violence, drugs and disrespect of women."[90] The next day, O'Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris.[89]
Three years later, Ludacris referenced O'Reilly in the song "Number One Spot." In an interview with RadarOnline.com in 2010, Ludacris stated that the two had made amends after a conversation between themselves at a charity event.[91]
On October 13, 2004, O'Reilly sued Andrea Mackris, a former producer for The O'Reilly Factor, with extortion charges, alleging that she had threatened a lawsuit unless he paid her more than $60 million. Subsequently that day, Mackris sued O'Reilly for sexual harassment, seeking $60 million in damages. Her lawsuit alleged two types of legally-cognizable sexual harassment claims that are not based upon physical contact: quid pro quo and hostile work environment. In her lawsuit, she filed a 22-page complaint with the Supreme Court of the State of New York[92] and produced quotations from alleged explicit phone conversations between herself and O'Reilly in which he "advised her to use a vibrator and told her about sexual fantasies involving her."[93] On October 15, 2004, Fox sought judicial permission to fire Mackris, but she was never dismissed. On October 19, 2004, Mackris filed an amended complaint seeking further damages for illegal retaliatory actions by O'Reilly, Fox News, and the News Corporation-owned newspaper The New York Post.[94] On October 28, 2004, O'Reilly and Mackris reached an out-of-court settlement and dropped all charges against each other. According to several published reports, as part of the settlement O'Reilly likely paid Mackris millions of dollars, but the terms of the agreement are confidential.[95]
On October 14, 2010, Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg walked off the set of The View after they both disagreed with statements made by O'Reilly, specifically O'Reilly's statement "Muslims killed us on 9/11."[96] Goldberg stated O'Reilly should be more specific than just labeling Muslims. O'Reilly defended his statement citing the lack of specificity when describing attacks by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in World War II. O'Reilly later explained on his show that the statement was valid when he said "Of course, what I said is absolutely true, but is insensitive to some. In a perfect world you always say Muslim terrorists killed us, but at this point I thought that was common knowledge. I guess I was wrong."[97] Barbara Walters disagreed with O'Reilly's defense of the World War II comparison stating that describing a religion is not the same as describing a country. Walters would go on to say, "We should be able to have discussion without ... walking off stage."[98] Former host and progressive commentator Rosie O'Donnell stated on her radio program that the incident was an example of what she viewed as regular hateful statements. O'Reilly responded by citing O'Donnell's earlier statement about claiming the threat from radical Christianity is similar to that of radical Islam.
On December 8, 2004, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) sent O'Reilly a letter criticizing him for making remarks offensive towards Jews on his radio talk show The Radio Factor.[99] Specifically, they found issue with his response to the call of a Jewish listener named "Joel," who complained of Christian proselytizing through the celebration of Christmas in public schools, which included O'Reilly stating that:
“You have a predominantly Christian nation. You have a federal holiday based on the philosopher Jesus. And you don’t wanna hear about it? Come on, [caller]…if you are really offended you gotta go to Israel then. I mean because we live in a country founded on Judeo… and that’s your guys’…Christian, that’s my guys’ philosophy. But overwhelmingly, America is Christian.”[100]
“American Jews are Americans. Jews and other religious minorities are part of America's great tradition of religious freedom. The discomfort with proselytizing, or the intrusion of Christian teachings in public schools, is a very legitimate concern."

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Political Commentator Bill O'Reilly was born on September 10th 1949 in New York City. He was born into a classic Irish Catholic family and attended private catholic schools.O'Reilly attended Marist College and studied history. Bill was also in the football club as a punter and wrote for the school newspaper. O'Reilly studied abroad at the University of London, and after coming home played semi professional baseball before graduating with a bachelors in history in 1971.O'Reilly studied broadcast journalism at Boston University after some time as a teacher in Florida. O'Reilly interned with different newspapers and stations while earning his masters. In the mid 90's O'Reilly earned a degree from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. O'Reilly's early career included anchor jobs in Scranton, Denver, Portland, Hartford, and Boston. In this time he won an Emmy and was praised for excellence in investigative reporting.O'Reilly worked as a WEBS anchor and won a second Emmy before earning the spot of correspondent for CBS network news. He later worked as a correspondent and assignment reporter for ABC.O'Reilly became a news star when he was an anchor on "Inside Addition" where he covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and the murder of Joel Steinberg. After leaving the team, he earned his 3rd degree from the Kennedy School of government in 1995.In 1996, O'Reilly launched "The O'Reilly Factor" the show he has anchored for 17 years. Since then he has used his show to report top political stories and it has become the #1 Cable News Show on TV.In addition to reporting the news, O'Reilly often dissects it. He has made accusations against organizations and figures for corruption, and has broke barriers in news. He often goes head to head with organizations, politicians, and celebrities in the social media. He has called out judges for court rulings he found to be poor and he has even accused people of being unamerican.One of his most famous organization rivals is the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union)In 1997, 10 year old Jeffery Curley was kidnapped by two men and murdered. His body was molested and dumped off. The two men claimed they had gotten the inspiration from literature they had read in a library from the NAMBLA, a radical organization that condones male on boy rape and sexual contact. The ACLU then defended the NAMBLA and the men responsible. Outraged, O'Reilly used his media power to shed light on the issue.However, his most famous head to head encounter was with organizations that raised money for 9/11 victims. Some faulty finances and numbers lead people to believe these organizations stole this money. O'Reilly publicly accused this organization and came head to head,with actor George Clooney, who claimed that O'Reilly was mistaken. Others that are often implicated as O'Reilly "rivals" are Michael Moore, George Soros, Alec Baldwin, and Susan Surandon. He is also playfully rivaled on late night television with comics Jon Stewart, David Letterman, and Jay Leno.O'Reilly has some core political beliefs that lean to the right, although he is a registered Independent. O'Reilly has written books and spoken about cultual traditions such as marriage, abortion, and patriotism. He has come to parrells with Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and George Soros on issues like these.O'Reilly has also published books about history and politics. He lives in New York and is the father of two children. His wife Maureen and he divorced in 2011.

      Majored in History at Marist College (Poughkeepsie, New York), earning his B.A. in 1971. He was given an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the school in 2000.
      Earned his M.A. in Public Administration from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1995.
      Politically, he has always claimed he is a registered independent on The O'Reilly Factor (1996). But, it was later revealed that O'Reilly was actually a registered Republican in Nassau County in 1994. O'Reilly re-registered as an independent soon after.
      During his career, he has been a reporter/anchor in: Boston, Miami, Scranton, Dallas, Denver, Portland (Oregon), Hartford, New York City, and Los Angeles. He has also covered wars in the Falkland Islands, El Salvador, Northern Ireland, and Israel.
      Names "Rainy Night in Georgia" by Brook Benton as his all-time favorite song. He also enjoys the music of Luther Vandross, Joe Cocker , The Doors, The Rolling Stones and Earth Wind & Fire.
      While at Marist, he claimed to have played quarterback, punter, and kicker on the varsity football team, but Marist did not have a varsity football team until after he graduated. He also was a semi-professional baseball pitcher with the New York Monarchs, and was the goalie on his high school hockey team.
      He was a high school teacher from 1971-1973 after graduating from Marist. He taught both History and English at Monsignor Edward Pace High School, a school founded by the Marist Order in Opa-Locka, Florida, located in North Miami-Dade. He also assisted with the school's baseball team.
      While he was a reporter at WNEP-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he also wrote the jokes for "Uncle Ted's Ghoul School," a Saturday night monster movie show.
      He has two young children: a daughter, Madeline (born in 1998) and a son, Spencer (born in 2003).
      In 2002, he successfully started "The Radio Factor"... a 2-hour radio version of The O'Reilly Factor (1996).
      On his website he lists the following as his favorite films: The Godfather (1972), The Godfather: Part II (1974), The Producers (1967), Casablanca (1942), Apocalypse Now (1979), Dracula (1992), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Unforgiven (1992), Shampoo (1975), Cool Hand Luke (1967), Viva Las Vegas (1964), Saturday Night Fever (1977), The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Dirty Harry (1971), The Wolf Man (1941), Rocky (1976), Young Frankenstein (1974), A Shot in the Dark (1964), The Alamo (1960), The Blob (1958), Easy Rider (1969).
      Sued by former The O'Reilly Factor (1996) associate producer Andrea Mackris, who accused him of sexual harassment. An out of court settlement was reached 15 days later, O'Reilly reportedly paying Mackris over $2 million without admitting guilt or issuing an apology. No guilt was ever proven on O'Reilly's part, however. (13 October 2004).
      Favorite songs: "L.A. Woman" by The Doors, "I Love Music" by The O'Jays, "Drive My Car" by The Beatles, "Just Dance" by Lady Gaga, "Kentucky Rain" by Elvis Presley.

      When O'Reilly expressed his staunch opposition to the erection of a mosque near the former site of Manhattan's Twin Towers on The View: Episode dated 14 October 2010 (2010), both Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar walked off the set in protest. Shortly after host Barbara Walters defended O'Reilly's right to his opinion, both co-hosts Goldberg and Behar later returned to their seats.
      Considers Boston as his second home. Parents met there, he attended school (Boston University, Harvard University) there, first journalist job there.
      Release of his book, "The No Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America".
      And the elites firmly believe that not much has changed in 40 years; that white Christian-Americans must be kept in check, or they will violate minority rights.
      Generally speaking, the elite media believe that the majority in this country -- white Christian Americans -- are prone to oppressing the minority. The elites rightfully point to the civil rights struggle as an example of how the majority can hurt a minority until the forces of reason stepped in.
      We'd save lives because Mexicans, "wetbacks"- whatever you want to call them-, the coyotes - they're not going to do what they're doing now, so people aren't going to die in the desert. So we save lives, all right, and we seal it down and make it one hundred times harder to come across.
      Does anyone know where the Best Men are? I hope they're not in the parking lot stealing our hubcaps.
      My father didn't tell me anything. My father just said: 'Shut up. Eat your food. There are people starving in Korea,' but he didn't - he didn't offer a lot of career counseling, but he never discouraged me.
      My thesis, you may know, is that nobody should ever talk about their sexuality in any - in any regard ever. You should not define yourself that way. It just makes life a lot rougher. So, therefore, I would probably say, if you're a gay celebrity, shut up about it.
      Because look ... when 2 percent of the population feels that you're doing them a favor, just forget it, you're not going to win. You're not going to win. And I don't have any respect by and large for the Iraqi people at all. I have no respect for them. I think that they're a prehistoric group that is -- yeah, there's excuses.
      Joseph Goebbels was the Minister of Propaganda for the Nazi regime and whose very famous quote was, "If you tell a lie long enough, it becomes the truth." All right? "If you tell a lie long enough, it becomes the truth." And that's what Stuart Smalley and Michael Moore and all of these guys do. They just run around.
      The Soros-Lewis mob despises Fox News because we have their number and we report on them accurately. They use the MoveOn web site to smear this network and others with whom they disagree. These people use techniques perfected by Dr. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister of information. They lie, distort, defame, all the time. So it's not surprising that MoveOn objected to a debate sponsored by Fox News and the Nevada Democratic Party.
      What's the difference between the KKK and Arianna Huffington? What's the difference? I don't see any difference between Huffington and the Nazis.
      [His impression of Harvard University] Well, the faculty at the Kennedy School of Government was pretty good when I was there. The most interesting class I had was 'Persuasion', and I use a lot of the points I learned there on the air to try to get people to listen to you so they understand it.
      I've said 'shut up' six times in 12 years and they all deserved it. They were either bloviating, filibustering or lying.
      (On the on-going feud with his Fox News competitor, Keith Olbermann, on MSNBC) There is no feud! I've never mentioned the man's name in my life and I will never mention it! There is no feud! There is no nemesis!
      I knew Howard [Stern], because he was the only guy in [Boston University] taller than me. And he has a big 'fro. He was always stoned. When I was walking around, I would go, "Oh, there is Howard," you know? We, of course, didn't know he was going to be a big media star, we just hoped he could get to the bathroom. I know what it took for Howard Stern to become successful, because he is like me. No uncle in the business, had to work his way up, cut through a whole bunch of BS. And I admire that. Would I do what he does? No. Do I object to what he does? No.

Bill O'Reilly heads arguably the best known, most written about, and most discussed cable news program around. "The O'Reilly Factor" on the Fox News Channel is certainly the most watched; it has been #1 in the ratings for more than 280 weeks, and is also seen in more than 30 countries.  
During its 11 years on the air, "The O'Reilly Factor" has developed a unique blend of news analysis and investigative reporting, and the No Spin Zone is sought out and appreciated by millions of people every weeknight.
More than five years ago, "The Radio Factor" also took to the air. For two hours each weekday, involved folks, listening now on more than 400 stations, call in to participate in timely debates, and the show has become one of the most successful radio franchises in the nation.
Bill O'Reilly writes, too. All four of O'Reilly's non-fiction books have perched atop The New York Times bestseller list; O'Reilly Factor for Kids was top selling children's non-fiction book in 2005 and Culture Warrior, in paperback placed in the Times' top ten list it's first week of release. Bill's most recent book is Kids Are Americans Too, a thoughtful, plain talking examination and discussion of youngster's rights and responsibilities under the Constitution. 
In addition to his books, O'Reilly's syndicated column appears in more than 300 newspapers across the nation. Every week the column is made available in advance of publication at BillOReilly.com, and through the website's newsletter.
O'Reilly started his on-air career in Scranton, Pennsylvania and then moved on to local reporting and anchoring stints in other cities including Dallas, Boston and New York.   He took on network reporting responsibilities with CBS and ABC News and then was named host of the first version of the nationally syndicated "Inside Edition." He arrived at Fox News in 1996. Along the way, he's won many journalism awards, including 2 Emmys. 
Bill O'Reilly was born in Manhattan, and raised on Long Island. His Bachelor's Degree is in History from Marist College, and he has a Master's in Broadcast Journalism from Boston University and another Master's Degree in Public Administration from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
In his spare time, Bill O'Reilly used to say he "took naps."  That was back when he had any spare time.
=======================================================
Bill O'Reilly's The Factor remains, as it has for the past 13 years, the most watched of all cable news shows.More than 5-million of you tune in each night, and the impact of that support and loyalty has carried over to Bill's other recent projects, where there has been extraordinary output and success. After five best-selling non-fiction books and his memoir, Bill has been focusing on writing about history. Killing Lincoln was first, followed by Killing Kennedy; both sold millions and zoomed to the top of the New York Times best seller list. The History Channel adapted the Lincoln Book into a movie (and DVD). It was such a big hit that the same was done for Killing Kennedy, starring Rob Lowe in the title role, with a major, high profile release (November 2013) to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the assassination.Meanwhile, after extensive research Bill also completed, and released, Killing Jesus (September 2013), revealing new details about Jesus' life, and chronicling the events leading to his death. And, more good news: still another in this series of explosive books is expected before very long.But, as they say, that's not all. Bill continues to make big news, as with his most recent ground-breaking interview with President Obama during the Super Bowl. There are also his many personal appearances across the nation, and we can't forget Keep It Pithy, which is based on Bill's love of language, and brevity.
 Some background about Bill himself: as many of you already know, he grew up on Long Island, got a BA (in history, of course) from Marist College, a Master's Degree in Broadcast Journalism from Boston University, and a second MA in Public Administration from The Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. In addition to studying history, Bill taught it in high school before going into broadcasting, and he's been a long time serious collector of historical documents.The Factor, the books, all this activity, sums up Bill's approach to life. No shortcuts, no compromise, no letup. That's Bill's way, and it continues.  As he told The New York Times, "I work harder now than I have ever worked in my life." As Bill always remarks, without you nothing happens, and we are especially happy you are keeping up right here at BillOReilly.com.
