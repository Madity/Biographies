 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Courteney Cox was born on June 15th, 1964 into an affluent Southern family. Her father Richard L Cox (1930-2001) was a business man married to her mother Courteney. She was the baby of the family with two older sisters (Virginia and Dottie) and an older brother, Richard Jr. She was raised in an exclusive society town, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Courteney was the archetypal Daddy's girl, and therefore was understandably devastated when, in 1974, her parents divorced, and her father moved to Florida.She became a rebellious teen, and did not make things easy for her mother, and new stepfather, New York businessman Hunter Copeland. Now, she is great friends with both. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. In her final year, she received her first taste of modeling. She appeared in an advert for the store, Parisians. Upon graduation, she left Alabama to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College. After one year she dropped out to a pursue a modeling career in New York, after being signed by the prestigious Ford Modelling Agency. She appeared on the covers of teen magazines such as Tiger Beat and Little Miss, plus numerous romance novels. She then moved on to commercials for Maybeline, Noxema, New York Telephone Company and Tampax.While modeling, she attended acting classes, as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress. In 1984, she landed herself a small part in one episode of As the World Turns (1956) as a young débutante named Bunny. Her first big break, however, was being cast by Brian De Palma in the Bruce Springsteen video "Dancing in The Dark". In 1985, she moved to LA to star alongside Dean Paul Martin in Misfits of Science (1985). It was a flop, but a few years later, she was chosen out of thousands of hopefuls to play Michael J. Fox's girlfriend, psychology major Lauren Miller in Family Ties (1982).In 1989, Family Ties (1982) ended, and Cox went through a lean spell in her career, featuring in unmemorable movies such as Mr. Destiny (1990) with Michael Caine. Fortunes changed dramatically for Cox, when in 1994, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the unexpected hit Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), and a year later she was cast as Monica Geller on the hugely successful sitcom Friends (1994). It was this part that turned her into an international superstar and led to an American Comedy Award nomination. In 1996 Cox starred in Wes Craven's horror/comedy Scream (1996) . This movie grossed over $100 million at the box office, and won Cox rave reviews for her standout performance as the wickedly bitchy and smug TV reporter Gale Weathers. She went on to play this character again in each of the three sequels. Not only did her involvement in this movie lead to critical acclaim, but it also led to her meeting actor husband David Arquette. He played her on-screen love interest Dewey, and life imitated art as the two fell in love for real. Their wedding took place in San Francisco, at the historic Grace Cathedral atop Nob Hill, on June 12th, 1999. Joined by 200 guests, including Cox's film star friends Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey, the happy couple finally became Mr. and Mrs. Arquette.
      Dated singer Adam Duritz. Duritz wrote the song "Monkey" for Courteney (from the Counting Crows album "Recovering the Satellites").
      In 1984 she worked at F.B.I. (Frontier Booking International) a concert booking agency in New York run by Ian Copeland (brother of Stewart Copeland of the Police) and a relative of hers.
      Announced in September, 1999 that her new legal and professional surname would be Courteney Cox Arquette. As a result the cast and producers of her Friends (1994) TV show also added "Arquette" to their own names in the opening credits of the 1999 season's premiere episode. Following the death of her father Richard L. Cox Sr. in 2001 she returned to her maiden name professionally.
      Has three dogs: Ella, Rags and Mr. McBarker (Mac for short). The latter is, rather unfortunately, a female.
      Ex-sister-in-law of Rosanna Arquette, Richmond Arquette, Patricia Arquette and Alexis Arquette.
      She likes to buy houses, renovate them, and then sell them off for profit. [This is also known as "flipping" houses, and is the subject of a number of home-improvement television shows.].
      She was paid $350 for her part as the "surprised" girl pulled from the crowd to dance with Bruce Springsteen in his 1984 video "Dancing in the Dark."
      On Friends (1994), she plays a character whose last name is Geller, and her husband played Robert Geller in Never Been Kissed (1999).
      Went into labor on her 5 year wedding anniversary, June 12, 2004, and gave birth to her daughter the next day, two days before her 40th birthday.
      Announced she and husband David Arquette are launching a production company called Coquette [June 25, 2004].
      Is the only central member of the Friends (1994) cast to have received an actual acting Razzie nomination. She was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress for the film 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001). The other cast members (except for Matthew Perry) have received nominations in categories such as Worst Screen Couple and Worst New Star.
      Her daughter's name Coco came from a compromise between her and husband David Arquette. Because of her Southern roots she wanted to name her daughter Courteney Cox, as her mom is Courteney Cox and so is she. However, David is half Jewish and it is against Jewish tradition to name a child after a living person. So the name came from the nickname Courteney's friends had for her mother while Courtney was growing up. They called her Mama Coco.
      She is one of three actors - along with David Arquette and Neve Campbell - to appear in all four "Scream" films.
      In March 2005, it was announced that she would become the first spokesperson for Kinerase Skin Care Products.
      Her Friends (1994) co-star Jennifer Aniston is the godmother of her daughter Coco. Jennifer is also the best friend of Courteney.
      She is the only regular cast member to not receive an Emmy nomination for their work on Friends (1994).
      Helped donate reward money to the "Natalie Holloway" investigation, having attended the same high school as Natalie.
      Her ex-husband, David Arquette, played "Malcolm" in the Friends (1994) episode, Friends: The One with the Jam (1996), on October 3, 1996. He played a stalker and mistakenly stalked fellow friend, "Phoebe". This was the first time Courtney and David were seen together on television, even though they weren't a couple at the time.
      She was the inspiration to the running gag of the "Carlton Dance" on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990). "The Carlton Dance" was a parody of her dance during the Bruce Springsteen music video "Dancing in the Dark."
      Her hosting of the 1995 airing of "SNL" began with a re-enactment of her "Dancing in the Dark" video appearance, with Adam Sandler copying Bruce Springsteen.
      Participated in the 3rd Munchkin's Project Pink annual breast cancer awareness campaign to raise money for breast cancer research. The project consists of the donation of celebrity-decorated and autographed bath ducks, put up for auction. [October 2008]

      In an interview in Starlog 124 (published November 1987), Cox revealed that she was auditioning for a part on Code Name: Foxfire (1985) at Universal Studios. She did not get cast, but found out they were auditioning people for Misfits of Science (1985) across the hall. Cox tried out and was subsequently cast.
      She has English, with smaller amounts (to varying degrees) of Welsh, Scottish, Irish, German, and Swedish, ancestry.
      I like keeping Gale bitchy. She has a reputation to live up to. She may have changed her hair but not much else. [About her character Gale Weathers in the Scream (1996) series.]
      I get so bored! I had a treadmill... I gave it to my mom. I had a stairmaster... gone. I had a recumbent bike...I dont know where that is. So I hate exercise except for Pilates.
      I'm a gemini, and I get so bored so easily. I mean, I have moved six times in the last eight years.
      A lot of my humor does come from anger. It's like, you're not gonna pull one over on me-which is pretty much my motto anyways.
      I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies- my taste goes much more to the offbeat and dark. I'd love to sink my teeth into something like Fargo (1996).
      I only have to do three things to look halfway decent, curl my eyelashes, fill in my eyebrows and put some lipstick on.
      I have to be physically attracted to someone. But I can't just be with someone just because it's great sex. Because orgasms don't last long enough.
      Before he moved in, David would say 'How are we ever going to meld together, because our tastes are so different? Maybe it's because we're truly in love that we can. [on husband David Arquette.]
      I want people to be happy, so I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do the show in the first place... just to see somebody, even if it's just for the day. To see their life change for that moment when they walk into the room and are that happy. It really makes you cry. It does. I hope I don't lose this feeling. [on producing her show Mix It Up (2003).]
      It's so much fun for us. I have a new love for the show since I've gotten into this relationship. Honestly, I was a little bored the first four years. I had some fun things to do and some good relationships, but Monica was developing and I felt like there was a lot of straight man stuff. Now we have something really fun to play - two really neurotic people trying to have a relationship. They're both afraid to commit, to get married, or take these steps. I have a really good time playing with him [Matthew Perry]. It's kind of like our relationship in real life - except we don't kiss. [About playing Monica and Chandler on Friends (1994).]
      I can definitely act even if I don't appear to have any particular style. I know I'm not a method actress, but I do believe in being physically and emotionally prepared for the role. If I have a scene where I'm supposed to be emotionally drawn out, then I'll think of the saddest thing in my life. If I have to be five pounds lighter to be the right physical type, I'll run my little tail around the block to make the weight.
      I wasn't going to go far. I'm only 5' 5" and I don't have that look. (on her early modeling days)
      [Asked "What's my pet peeve?"] Not being heard. You don't have to agree with me, just hear me. (Marie Claire - August 2006 - "The Real Me: Courteney on Courteney")
      [on Scream (1996)] I wanted to play "Gail Weathers" because she was a real bitchy character. You know, I was on Friends (1994) and I played this nice girl, Monica, but Gale, she was so ruthless.
=======================================================
Courteney Bass Cox (born June 15, 1964)[2] is an American actress, producer, and director. She is best known for her roles as Monica Geller on the NBC sitcom Friends, Gale Weathers in the horror series Scream, and as Jules Cobb in the ABC/TBS sitcom Cougar Town, for which she earned her first Golden Globe nomination. Cox also starred in the FX series Dirt. She owns a production company, called Coquette Productions, which was created by herself and then husband David Arquette. Cox has also worked as a director on her sitcom Cougar Town and the television movie Talhotblond.
Courteney Cox was raised in Mountain Brook, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham,[3][4] the daughter of businessman Richard Lewis Cox (January 28, 1931 – September 3, 2001)[5] and his wife Courteney (née Bass, later Copeland).[6][7] She has two older sisters, Virginia and Dottie, and an older brother, Richard, Jr. Her parents divorced in 1974 and her mother then married businessman Hunter Copeland (uncle to music promoter and business manager Ian Copeland).[8] After graduating from Mountain Brook High School, Cox left for Mount Vernon College in Washington, D.C., but did not complete her architecture course, opting instead to pursue a career in modeling and acting.[9]
Cox appeared in the 1984 music video for Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark" as a young woman pulled onstage at the St. Paul Civic Center to dance with Springsteen. Her early television work includes a starring role in the short-lived television series Misfits of Science (1985), and later a recurring role (1987–89) on the TV series Family Ties as Lauren Miller, the girlfriend of Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox). Her early film roles include Masters of the Universe (1987) and Cocoon: The Return (1988) and I'll Be Home for Christmas (1988). She had a supporting role as Jewel, the hard-as-nails assistant to James Belushi's character, in the 1990 fantasy film Mr. Destiny. In 1994, shortly before the debut of the sitcom, Friends, Cox appeared with Jim Carrey in the film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and on Seinfeld in "The Wife" episode as Jerry's girlfriend named Meryl. In 1995, she was cast in Toad the Wet Sprocket's music video "Good Intentions". The song is also on the Friends Soundtrack.
Later in 1994 Cox was asked to audition for the part of Rachel Green on a new sitcom, Friends; she was cast as Monica Geller instead.[10] At first the most famous cast member of the new show, Cox joined fellow castmates Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Matt LeBlanc (Joey Tribbiani), Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing) and David Schwimmer (Ross Geller) for what would become her most famous role, lasting for 10 seasons until 2004. According to the Guinness Book of World Records (2005), Cox (along with her female costars) became the highest paid TV actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck for the final two seasons of Friends.
Between seasons five and six, Cox married David Arquette, and changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. An in-joke reference to this is made in the beginning credits of the episode "The One After Vegas", where the rest of the cast and executive producers have "Arquette" added to their names. The dedication "For Courteney and David, who did get married" – a reference to Monica and Chandler's decision not to marry in the episode – appears during the fade out to the tag scene.[11]
During her time on Friends, Cox appeared in the high-profile Hollywood films Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997), and Scream 3 (2000), as reporter Gale Weathers. She met her husband, David Arquette, who played her on-screen love interest Dwight "Dewey" Riley, while filming the first Scream film. Both Cox and Arquette reprised their respective roles from the Scream trilogy in 2011's Scream 4. The movie was released in theaters April 15, 2011.[12]
Her other films include The Runner, 3000 Miles to Graceland and The Shrink Is In. In late 2003, Cox and Arquette produced one season of the reality television series Mix It Up. The lifestyle show, which aired on the We cable channel, struggled with low ratings and was not renewed for a second season.
After her Friends role, Cox was producer Marc Cherry's first choice to be offered a starring role as Susan Mayer on Desperate Housewives. However, Cox was unavailable due to her pregnancy and the role went to Teri Hatcher. A couple of years later, Cox signed a deal with ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television) to star in her own series. After Friends, Cox starred in the independent film November (2005) which had a limited theatrical release; costarred with Tim Allen in the critically derided Zoom; and cameoed in the big budget remake of The Longest Yard as the girlfriend of Adam Sandler's character. She supplied her voice for the animated film Barnyard. A Friends reunion film was rumored to be in production; following the success of Sex and the City: The Movie,[13] but this has been denied by Warner Bros. and others.
In 2007, Cox starred as Lucy Spiller, a cynical tabloid editor, in Dirt, a television drama for FX. Cox and her husband David Arquette were the executive producers of the series.[14] According to Cox, the series was canceled after the second season in 2008.[15] In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced that Cox had signed on to star in a three-episode arc for the television series Scrubs.[16]
In 2009, Cox began her roles as the star of the single-camera comedy series on ABC called Cougar Town, playing a newly single 40-year-old mother on the hunt for new experiences.[17][18][19] The show's third season was to premiere in November 2011 but was moved to February 14, 2012. In the third season, Cox directed two of the show's fifteen episodes of that season. The show's fourth season premiered on January 8, 2013. In 2009 she also starred in a three episode arc on former Friends co-star Lisa Kudrow's online web series Web Therapy.
In June 2012, Cox directed and made a cameo appearance in a Lifetime television movie called Talhotblond, which premiered on the network on June 23, 2012.[20] The movie depicts a man who begins an online affair and a secret life, while his wife and family remains unaware.
Cox's previous boyfriends include rock promoter Ian Copeland,[21] Michael Keaton and Adam Duritz of Counting Crows. Cox married actor David Arquette on June 12, 1999.[22] After their daughter, Coco, was born in June 2004,[23][24] Cox suffered from postpartum depression.[25] Jennifer Aniston is Coco's godmother.[26] On October 11, 2010, it was announced that Cox and Arquette had separated, though they still maintain a close friendship and business relationship.[27][28][29] In June 2012, Arquette filed for divorce after nearly two years of separation from Cox.[30] The divorce became final in May 2013.[31]

 Courteney Cox goes behind the camera and into the director’s chair, marking her long-form directorial debut, in the Lifetime Original Movie "Talhotblond." Courteney Cox gained overnight fame as she endeared herself to millions as the neurotic yet lovable Monica Gellar on NBC’s Emmy Award–winning comedy "Friends." The show garnered Screen Actors Guild Award nominations as Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series from 1999–2004. Cox currently stars as Jules Cobb in her Golden Globe–nominated role as a recently divorced mom in her forties facing the humorous challenges, pitfalls and rewards of life's next chapter in ABC’s comedy "Cougar Town." Co-created by Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biege and executive-produced by Courteney, "Cougar Town" will move to TBS for its fourth season, which will begin production in the fall. In addition to starring in and producing the show, Cox directed an episode in the third season as well. On the silver screen, Courteney most recently starred in the fourth installment of the "Scream" franchise, the film that marked the reinvention of the slasher-film genre. In the film, she reprised her role as newswoman Gale Weathers as the town dealt with the return of the killer Ghostface after a decade-long absence. In 2004, Courteney established her own production company, Coquette, with David Arquette. Projects have included "Cougar Town," "Dirt" (which she created, starred in and produced), "Mix It Up," an interior-design show for cable’s WE (Women’s Entertainment) Network, the comedy "Daisy Does America" for TBS and "The Tripper," a horror film written and directed by David Arquette, among others. Courteney made her acting debut in 1984 on the daytime soap "As the World Turns," and later that same year, she was cast by Brian de Palma for Bruce Springsteen's video 'Dancing in the Dark.' She landed her first well-known work as an actress in 1987 when she was cast as the bright, perky girlfriend of Michael J. Fox on "Family Ties." Additional film credits include "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," "Bedtime Stories," "3000 Miles to Graceland," "Mr. Destiny," "Cocoon: The Return," "Zoom," "November," "The Longest Yard" and "Barnyard."

Having recently been renewed for a third season, disproving TV's usual out-of-sight/out-of-mind policy, Fox's The Mindy Project emerges from a three-month hiatus with back-to-back episodes (Tuesday, 9/8c) demonstrating Mindy Kaling's devotion to screwball comedy. A concept which Amy Schumer would probably find a way to make sound really, hilariously dirty. (Her uproarious Comedy Central sketch-com Inside Amy Schumer returns at 10:30/9:30c, making this an especially happy April Fools Day.)
Even in a season distinguished by insta-duds like Lucky 7 and Betrayal, ABC hits a new low with Mind Games (Tuesday, 10/9c), an inexplicably and ridiculously convoluted drama which achieves the rare trick of making Christian Slater look like a master of understated acting. He plays an ex-con who teams with his frenetic, bipolar brother (Steve Zahn in an eye-poppingly cartoonish performance), an expert in all human behaviors but his own, to start a firm that specializes in elaborate psychological manipulations to achieve their clients' aims.
Cougar Town star Brian Van Holt had plenty of reasons to be nervous about the directing the second episode of the sitcom's fifth season.   Not only was Tuesday's episode (10/9c, TBS) Holt's directorial debut, but he was also tasked with directing Friends alum Matthew Perry's highly anticipated guest appearance. "100 percent I was nervous for sure," Holt tells TVGuide.com. "But Matthew is...

And Josh Holloway is very much the main reason to tune into CBS's Intelligence (Tuesday, 9/8c), a proficient if initially perfunctory action thriller that benefits immeasurably from its star's gruff, bluff machismo. Although a little less brooding (over a long-missing wife who might be a terrorist) would make Gabriel, and Intelligence, a lot more fun.
