Ivanka Marie Trump (born October 30, 1981) is an American businesswoman, writer, heiress, and former model. In her role as Executive Vice President of Development & Acquisitions at The Trump Organization, Trump is involved with all aspects of the company's real estate and hotel management initiatives. Ivanka Trump is the principal of Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry. The Ivanka Trump Lifestyle Collection also includes fragrance, footwear, handbags, outerwear and eyewear collections.
Ivanka Trump was born in New York City, to parents Ivana Trump and American business magnate Donald Trump. Her parents divorced in 1991, when she was about 10 years old. She attended The Chapin School in New York, and graduated from Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Connecticut. She spent two years at Georgetown University, then transferred to the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating summa cum laude in 2004 with a B.S. in Economics.[1][2][3]
Before joining the family business, Trump worked for Forest City Enterprises,[4] and joined forces with Dynamic Diamond Corp., a diamond trading company sightholder, to design and introduce a line of jewelry at the brand's first flagship retail store called Ivanka Trump on Madison Avenue. Trump is currently Executive Vice President of Development & Acquisitions at The Trump Organization. She has also released her own line of handbags and footwear.[5][6]
Trump's first cover was a 1997 issue of Seventeen. Since then, she has made her way down fashion runways for Versace, Marc Bouwer and Thierry Mugler. She has done advertisement campaigns for Tommy Hilfiger and Sassoon Jeans and was featured on the cover of Stuff in August 2006 and again in September 2007. She was also featured on the covers of Forbes, Golf Magazine, Avenue Magazine, Elle Mexico and in the October 2007 issue of Harper's Bazaar.[7] She placed Number 83 in the 2007 Maxim Hot 100. She has also placed Number 99 in the Top 99 Women of 2007 and then at 84 in the 2008 edition on AskMen.com. Trump's page[8] in the Fashion Model Directory provides complete professional details of her prior work in that domain. Ivanka Trump also was featured on the cover of Top Choice Magazine.[9]
In 2006, she filled in for Carolyn Kepcher on five episodes of her father's television program The Apprentice 5, first appearing to help judge the Gillette task in week 2.[10] Like Kepcher, Trump visited the site of the tasks and spoke to the teams, asking them pointed questions. She also evaluated contestants in the boardroom, pointing out critical errors and rebutting excuses they offered for losing the tasks. Though initially unsympathetic to the contestants, Trump later said, "Whenever I see their breakdowns, I understand. They go virtually 24 hours a day, and each task takes about three days. Unless they win, they don't get a day off... It's an incredible amount of work..."[7] Trump now collaborates with season 5 winner Sean Yazbeck on his winner's project of choice, Trump SoHo Hotel-Condominium.[11][12]
Trump replaced Carolyn Kepcher as a primary boardroom judge during the Apprentice 6 and The Celebrity Apprentice.
In 1997, she hosted the Miss Teen USA Pageant, which is partially owned by her father, Donald Trump. In 2003, she was featured in Born Rich, a documentary about the experience of growing up as a child in one of the world's most affluent families. During an April 2006 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jay Leno commented that he could hear her father's influence and inflections in her. David Letterman also made a similar comment when she appeared on Late Show with David Letterman on April 24, 2007.[citation needed] Trump was a featured guest-judge on Project Runway Season 3. She was also at a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, event in April 2007 called the Creating Wealth Summit in which she spoke for about 30 minutes about making money and her latest projects. She has been offered to appear on The Bachelorette, but she declined.[13] On October 25, 2010, Trump along with her husband, Jared Kushner, showed up on Season 4 Episode 6 of Gossip Girl portraying themselves for a brief time.[14]
Ivanka Trump wrote a book called The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life, which was published in October 2009.[15]
In July 2009, after studying with Rabbi Elie Weinstock from the Modern Orthodox Ramaz School, Trump converted to Judaism[17][18] and took the name Yael.[19]
On October 25, 2009, Trump married businessman Jared Kushner.[20] Jared Kushner's father Charles Kushner owns Kushner Properties and Jared shares in the ownership. Jared is also the owner of The New York Observer in Bedminster, New Jersey.[21][22] In July 2011, Trump gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Arabella Rose.[23][24] In April 2013, Trump announced that she was pregnant with her second child. On October 14, 2013, she gave birth to a baby boy named Joseph Fredrick Kushner.[25]

          She is a perfect example of professionalism, motherhood and ambition. She believes that hard work and faith can get you anywhere. Ivana Trump is the ultimate symbol of strength, glamour and worldliness.  She has been in the spotlight for over twenty years and has always held her ground. From her athletic competitions as a child to her business ventures today, Ivana always comes out ahead.
Ivana Trump grew up in Gottwaldov, Czechoslvakia, a town just south of Prague.  As a child, her father noticed her athletic talent and began training her, focusing on skiing.  At the age of six, she joined the ski circuit and won the first downhill race she competed in. Her father felt that she needed more concentrated training and enrolled Ivana in a very strict Communist training camp for child athletes when she was 12.  Ivana skied competitively through high school and continued competing after she graduated.  Shortly thereafter she met another professional skier George Syrovatka, and fell in love.  Like Ivana, he was also a student at Charles University in Prague and a member of the Czechoslovakian ski team.  Ivana was a prized skier for the university and her country.  She earned a Masters Degree in physical education and languages.  Ivana then immigrated to Canada where George was waiting for her.  He owned a ski boutique and a sporting goods store.  The couple traveled together and to earn extra money and enjoy the sport they both loved, they were ski coaches for teen ski racers and instructors on the weekends.  But after a few years in Montreal, Ivana wanted a career.
She began modeling for Audrey Morris, the top modeling agency in Montreal at the time.  In the summer of 1976, her agency sent several models to New York to promote the Olympic Games held in Montreal.  A night on the town led the models to an overcrowded, trendy restaurant where they were immediately seated at a special table; compliments of a man named Donald Trump.
The couple spent a year together before they were married in 1977. After a year of marriage, the Trumps had their first son, Donald Jr.  Over the next five years, Ivana gave birth to two more children: Ivanka and Eric.
While she was married to Donald, Ivana became the Vice President of Interior Design for the Trump Organization.  She was responsible for all of the interior design of Trumps real estate: the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Trump Tower, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City which Ivana supervise construction and interior designed and eventually co-managed the project between Trump Organization.  Ivana was the Chief Executive Officer and President of Trumps Castle Hotel and Casino for five years and then Chief Executive Office and President of the Plaza Hotel, New York for four years.  Under her leadership, The Plaza was recognized as The Best Luxury Hotel in the USA.
As their marriage and troubles were printed on the covers and front pages of publications everywhere, the Trumps were separated in 1990 and their marriage ended in divorce in 1992.  Although people wondered what Ivana would be without Donald, she has proven she is better then ever.
Today, she has established two companies- Ivana, Inc. that manages her appearances and Ivana Haute Couture, which markets Ivana products with sales of Ivanas line of cosmetics, accessories and fragrances sold over the Internet, Ivanas company has matured into a multi-million dollar business. To expose her products, Ivana appears in other countries such as the Canadian Shopping Channel.
Ivana, Inc. manages her other activities including appearances in print and television advertisements such as Coors Light, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Cotton Inc. and the Milk Campaign and Canadian Lottery Campaign. She has also made a cameo appearance in the feature film The First Wives Club with famous quote The Best Is Yet To Come. Ivana has written two fiction books For Love Alone and Free to Love and one non-fiction The Best Is Yet To Come and currently writes a column Ask Ivana for Globe Magazine.  Ivana has been portrayed by ABC Biography Channel and Portraits by Lifetime.
Under the same company, Ivana gives many speeches throughout the year.  She speaks about being a mother, the role that holds absolute importance in her life. Her motivational speech Women Who Dare is about having confidence in yourself and being a woman who has to balance her life between being a mother, wife, executive and a woman who also needs to take care of herself. Ivana also gives presentations promoting female athletics, and being an entrepreneur.  Ivana takes great pride in being a woman and strives to promote leadership and motivation through her work and image.  She serves as a role model for women everywhere.
