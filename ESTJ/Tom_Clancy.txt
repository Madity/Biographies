Thomas Leo "Tom" Clancy, Jr. (April 12, 1947 – October 1, 2013) was an American novelist and historian best known for his technically detailed espionage and military science storylines set during and in the aftermath of the Cold War, and for video games that bear his name for licensing and promotional purposes. Seventeen of his novels were bestsellers, and more than 100 million copies of his books are in print.[1] His name was also a brand for similar movie scripts written by ghost writers and non-fiction books on military subjects. He was a part-owner of the Baltimore Orioles and Vice Chairman of their Community Activities and Public Affairs committees.
Tom Clancy was born at Franklin Square Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, on April 12, 1947,[2] and grew up in the Northwood neighborhood.[2][3][4] He was the second of three children to Thomas Clancy, who worked for the United States Postal Service, and Catherine Clancy, who worked in a store's credit department.[5][6] His mother worked in order to send him to the private Catholic Loyola Blakefield in Towson, Maryland, from which he graduated in 1965.[2][4][5] He then attended Loyola College (now Loyola University) in Baltimore, graduating in 1969 with a degree in English literature.[2][6] While at university, he was president of the chess club.[5] He joined the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps; however he was ineligible to serve due to his nearsightedness, which required him to wear thick eyeglasses.[1][5] After graduating he worked for an insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut.[7] In 1973, he joined the O. F. Bowen Agency, a small insurance agency based in Owings, Maryland, founded by his wife's grandfather.[1][5][6][7] In 1980, he purchased the insurance agency from his wife's grandmother, and wrote novels in his spare time.[6][8] While working at the insurance agency, he wrote The Hunt For Red October.[1]
Clancy's literary career began in 1982 when he started writing The Hunt for Red October which in 1984 he sold for publishing to the Naval Institute Press for $5,000.[1][3] The publisher was impressed with the work; Deborah Grosvenor, the Naval Institute Press editor who read through the work, said later that she convinced the publisher: "I think we have a potential best seller here, and if we don’t grab this thing, somebody else would," and considered that Clancy had an "innate storytelling ability, and his characters had this very witty dialogue".[1] The publisher requested Clancy to cut numerous technical details, amounting to about 100 pages.[1] Clancy, who had wanted to sell 5,000 copies, ended up selling over 45,000.[3][8] After publication, the book received praise from President Ronald Reagan, calling the work "the best yarn", subsequently boosting sales to 300,000 hardcover and 2 million paperback copies of the book, making it a national bestseller.[1][3][7] The book was critically praised for its technical accuracy, which led to Clancy's meeting several high-ranking officers in the U.S. military.[1]
Clancy's fiction works, The Hunt for Red October (1984), Patriot Games (1987), Clear and Present Danger (1989), and The Sum of All Fears (1991), have been turned into commercially successful films with actors Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck as Clancy's most famous fictional character Jack Ryan, while his second most famous character, John Clark, has been played by actors Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber. All but two of Clancy's solely written novels feature Jack Ryan or John Clark.
The first NetForce novel (titled Net Force and published in 1999) was adapted as a television movie, starring Scott Bakula and Joanna Going. The first Op-Center novel was released to coincide with a 1995 NBC television mini-series of the same name (Tom Clancy's Op-Center published in 1995) starring Harry Hamlin and a cast of stars. Though the mini-series did not continue, the book series did, but it had little in common with the first mini-series other than the title and the names of the main characters.
With the release of The Teeth of the Tiger (2003), Clancy introduced Jack Ryan's son and two nephews as main characters; these characters continued in his last four novels, Dead or Alive (2010), Locked On (2011), Threat Vector (2012), and Command Authority (2013).
Clancy wrote several nonfiction books about various branches of the U.S. Armed Forces (see non-fiction listing, below). Clancy also branded several lines of books and video games with his name that are written by other authors, following premises or storylines generally in keeping with Clancy's works. These are sometimes referred to by fans as "apostrophe" books; Clancy did not initially acknowledge that these series were being authored by others; he only thanked the actual authors in the headnotes for their "invaluable contribution to the manuscript".
By 1988, Clancy had earned $1.3 million for The Hunt for Red October and had signed a $3 million contract for his next three books.[9] By 1997, it was reported that Penguin Putnam Inc. (part of Pearson Education) would pay Clancy $50 million for world rights to two new books, and another $25 million to Red Storm Entertainment for a four-year book/multimedia deal.[10] Clancy followed this up with an agreement with Penguin's Berkley Books for 24 paperbacks to tie in with the ABC television miniseries Tom Clancy's Net Force aired in the fall/winter of 1998. The Op-Center universe has laid the ground for the series of books written by Jeff Rovin, which was in an agreement worth $22 million, bringing the total value of the package to $97 million.[10]
In 1993, Clancy joined a group of investors that included Peter Angelos and bought the Baltimore Orioles from Eli Jacobs.[11][12] In 1998, he reached an agreement to purchase the Minnesota Vikings but had to abandon the deal because of a divorce settlement cost.[13][14]
In 2008, the French video game manufacturer Ubisoft purchased the use of Clancy's name for an undisclosed sum. It has been used in conjunction with video games and related products such as movies and books.[15] Based on his interest in private spaceflight and his US$1 million investment in the launch vehicle company Rotary Rocket,[16] Clancy was interviewed in 2007 for the documentary film Orphans of Apollo (2008).
A longtime holder of conservative and Republican views, Clancy's books bear dedications to American conservative political figures, most notably Ronald Reagan. A week after the September 11, 2001 attacks, on The O'Reilly Factor, Clancy suggested that left-wing politicians in the United States were partly responsible for September 11 due to their "gutting" of the Central Intelligence Agency.[17]
On September 11, 2001, Clancy was interviewed by Judy Woodruff on CNN.[18] During the interview, he asserted "Islam does not permit suicide" (see Islam and suicide). Among other observations during this interview, Clancy cited discussions he had with military experts on the lack of planning to handle a hijacked plane being used in a suicide attack and criticized the news media's treatment of the United States Intelligence Community. Clancy appeared again on PBS's Charlie Rose, to discuss the implications of the day's events with Richard Holbrooke, New York Times journalist Judith Miller, and Senator John Edwards, among others.[19] Clancy was interviewed on these shows because his 1994 book Debt of Honor included a scenario where a disgruntled Japanese airline pilot crashes a fueled Boeing 747 into the U.S. Capitol dome during an address by the President to a joint session of Congress, killing the President and most of Congress. This plot device bore strong similarities to the attacks of September 11, 2001.
In later years, Clancy associated himself with General Anthony Zinni, a critic of the George W. Bush administration, and was also critical of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.[20]
Clancy and his first wife Wanda Thomas King, a nursing student who became an eye surgeon,[6][22] married in 1969, separated briefly in 1995, and permanently separated in December 1996.[23] Clancy filed for divorce in November 1997,[24] which became final in January 1999.[25]
On June 26, 1999, Clancy married freelance journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn, whom he had met in 1997.[26] Llewellyn is the daughter of J. Bruce Llewellyn and a family friend of Colin Powell, who originally introduced the couple to each other.[17] They remained together until Clancy's death in October 2013.[27]
Clancy's estate, which was once a summer camp, is located in Calvert County, Maryland. It is 80 acres (32 ha) and has a panoramic view of the Chesapeake Bay.[28] The stone mansion, which cost US$2 million, has twenty-four rooms and features a shooting range in the basement.[22][28] The property also features a World War II-era M4 Sherman tank, a Christmas gift from his first wife.[28][29]
Clancy also purchased a 17,000 square feet (1,600 m2) penthouse condominium in the Ritz-Carlton in Baltimore's Inner Harbor for US$16 million.[7]
Clancy died on October 1, 2013, of an undisclosed illness[30] at Johns Hopkins Hospital, near his Baltimore home. Clancy is survived by his wife, Alexandra; their daughter, Alexis; and four children from his marriage to Wanda King: Michelle Bandy, Christine Blocksidge, Kathleen Clancy, and Thomas Clancy III.[1] The Chicago Tribune quoted Pulitzer Prize-winning author Stephen Hunter as saying, "When he published The Hunt for Red October he redefined and expanded the genre and as a consequence of that, a lot of people were able to publish such books who had previously been unable to do so."[31]
John D. Gresham, a co-author and researcher with Clancy on several books, attributed Clancy's death to heart problems: "Five or six years ago Tom suffered a heart attack and he went through bypass surgery. It wasn’t that he had another heart attack, [his heart] just wore out."[32]
Clancy's first published novel. CIA analyst Jack Ryan assists in the defection of a respected Soviet naval captain, along with the most advanced ballistic missile submarine of the Soviet fleet. The movie (1990) stars Alec Baldwin as Ryan and Sean Connery as Captain Ramius. U.S, submarine commander Bart Mancuso is introduced in this novel, and nearly every subsequent book has Mancuso in ever increasing command of U.S. submarine forces. U.S. naval aviator Robby Jackson is also introduced and eventually succeeds Jack Ryan as President of the United States.
War between NATO and USSR. The basis of the combat game of the same name, this book is not a member of the Ryan story series (although the protagonist of the story has many similarities with Jack Ryan). Cowritten with Larry Bond.
Patriot Games chronologically predates the first book that Clancy wrote, The Hunt for Red October. Jack Ryan foils an attack in London on the Prince and Princess of Wales by the "Ulster Liberation Army". The ULA then attacks Ryan's Maryland home while he is hosting the Prince and Princess for dinner. The movie stars Harrison Ford as Ryan and Samuel L. Jackson as Robby Jackson.
The sequel to "The Hunt for Red October." First appearance of John Clark and Sergey Golovko. Ryan leads a CIA operation which forces the head of the KGB to defect. Other elements include anti-satellite lasers and other SDI-type weapons, and the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Major Alan Gregory is introduced here. (He appears later, updating SAM software in The Bear and the Dragon). Colonel Bondarenko also is introduced here. (He appears in later books offering advice to Golovko in "Executive Orders" and commanding the Russian Army defenses against China in its sequel "The Bear and the Dragon".)
The President authorizes the CIA to use American military forces in a covert war against cocaine producers in Colombia. The operation is betrayed. Ryan meets John Clark as they lead a mission to rescue abandoned soldiers. Domingo "Ding" Chavez (Clark's protege in later novels) is one of the rescued soldiers. The 1994 film stars Harrison Ford as Ryan, Willem Dafoe as Clark, and Raymond Cruz as Chavez.
Arab terrorists find a nuclear weapon that had been lost by Israel, and use it to attack the United States. This nearly triggers a war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, due to the incompetence of the new President and his mistress with an anti-Ryan agenda. Ryan intervenes to avert the war. The 2002 film stars Ben Affleck as Ryan and Liev Schreiber as Clark, and changes the identity and motivation of the terrorists to neo-Nazis.
Without Remorse takes place during the Vietnam War, when Jack Ryan was a teenager. Ex-SEAL John Clark (then John Kelly) fights a one-man war against drug dealers in Baltimore, attracting the attention of Jack's father Emmett, a Baltimore police detective. He also helps plan and execute a raid on a prisoner-of-war camp in North Vietnam. Clark joins the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
A secret cabal of extreme nationalists gains control of Japan (having developed some nuclear weapons), and start a war with the U.S. Ryan, now National Security Advisor, and Clark and Chavez, agents in Japan, help win the war. The Vice President resigns in a scandal, and the President appoints Ryan to replace him. A vengeful, die-hard Japanese airline pilot then crashes a jetliner into the U.S. Capitol during a joint session of Congress attended by most senior U.S. government officials, including the President. Ryan thus becomes the new President through succession.
This is the immediate sequel to Debt of Honor. President Ryan survives press hazing, an assassination attempt, and a biological warfare attack on the United States. Clark and Chavez trace the virus to a Middle Eastern madman, and the U.S. military goes to work.
Follows the missions of USS Cheyenne in a future war with China precipitated by China's invasion of the disputed Spratly Islands. Also not a Ryan universe book, SSN is actually a loosely connected collection of "scenario" chapters in support of the eponymous video game.
Released to coincide with the video game of the same name. John Clark and Ding, who is now Clark's son-in-law, lead an elite multinational anti-terrorist unit that combats a worldwide genocide attempt by eco-terrorists. Ryan is the U.S. President and only mentioned or referred to as either 'The President' or 'Jack'.
War between Russia and China. Ryan recognizes the independence of Taiwan, Chinese police officers kill a Roman Catholic Cardinal, and American armed forces help Russia defeat a Chinese invasion of Siberia.
In the early 1980s, CIA analyst Ryan aids in the defection of a Soviet officer who knows of a plan to assassinate Pope John Paul II.
Jack Ryan's son, Jack Ryan, Jr., becomes an intelligence analyst, and then a field consultant, for The Campus, an off-the-books intelligence agency with the freedom to discreetly assassinate individuals "who threaten national security", following the end of the Jack Ryan Sr. presidential administration. This book of the Jack Ryan series by Tom Clancy introduces Ryan's son and two nephews as heirs to his spook-legacy.
The story picks up where The Teeth of the Tiger left off with Jack Ryan, Jr. and The Campus trying to catch a terrorist known as "The Emir".
A terrorist bombing in Pakistan wipes out Max Moore’s entire CIA team. As the only survivor, the former Navy SEAL plunges deeper into the treacherous tribal lands to find the terrorist cell, but what he discovers there leads him to a much darker conspiracy in an unexpected part of the globe — the United States/Mexico border.
While Jack Ryan Jr. trains to become a field operative within The Campus, his father campaigns for re-election as President of the United States. A devout enemy of Jack Sr. launches a privately funded vendetta to discredit him, while a corrupt Pakistani general has entered into a deadly pact with a fanatical terrorist to procure nuclear warheads.
Jack Ryan has only just moved back into the Oval Office when he is faced with a new international threat. An aborted coup in the People's Republic of China has left President Wei Zhen Lin with no choice but to agree with the expansionist policies of General Su Ke Qiang. They have declared the South China Sea a protectorate and are planning an invasion of Taiwan. The Ryan administration is determined to thwart China’s ambitions, but the stakes are dangerously high as a new breed of powerful Chinese anti-ship missiles endanger the US Navy's plans to protect the island. Meanwhile, Chinese cyber warfare experts have launched a devastating attack on American infrastructure.
There is a new strong man in Russia but his rise to power is based on a dark secret hidden decades in the past. The clue to the mystery lies with a most unexpected source, President Jack Ryan.[33]
Without Remorse (1969–70, 1973 - Starts late 1969, in Hurricane Camille's aftermath. Continues the following spring, in 1970. Epilogue is titled "February 12, 1973") Ryan briefly appears in this novel.
Patriot Games (1982, based on a reference to Ryan's age, which is 31 at the beginning of the novel. This roughly fits with a reference to the Princess of Wales's first child being a baby and a few months old, Prince William was born in 1982) Discrepancies include the reference to a van having a likely year of manufacture of 1984. The subsequent events of Red Rabbit would seem to push its date back to 1981, rather than 1982.
Red Rabbit (seems to start in the spring of 1982 as Jack Ryan, Jr.'s age in the novel is given as 6 months, although the main action explicitly starts on August 15) Discrepancies between 1982 in the Ryanverse and in actual events, aside from the date of the attempt on the Pope's life, include: the actual death of Mikhail Suslov in January 1982; frequent references to "Transformers" which did not appear until 1984; the fact that the Orioles played the Phillies in the World Series in 1983; the Baltimore Colts' relocation to Indianapolis not occurring until 1984; a reference to "Coke Classic" which did not debut until the summer of 1985.
The Hunt for Red October (1984 - although the calendar used is for 1982 and Ryan is spending his first Christmas in London, having arrived in the previous novel)
The Cardinal of the Kremlin (1986) – "The first chapter is set in January and states that Ryan is 35 years old. It also has references to the other books set earlier. For example the Foleys have been in Moscow for almost four years. The book must begin (not including prologue which was set end of previous year) in January 1986.
Starting with the following novel, the series becomes distinctly different from real history as noted below.
Clear and Present Danger (1988) The book refers to Jack's age as 40. Troops are sent into Colombia to fight against the Medina Cartel and reduce drug shipments to America.
The Sum of All Fears (1990–1991) — Israel partially cedes sovereignty over Jerusalem to the Vatican and Saudi Arabia, and the city becomes a United Nations protectorate policed by Swiss Guards. Residents of Jerusalem can choose between either Vatican, Israeli or Islamic judicial law. Denver is devastated by a terrorist nuclear explosion. The book occurs after the Persian Gulf War and before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It is implied that both events occur at the same time in the Ryan universe as in actual history (of the Soviet Union dissolution), 1991. In the earlier chapters it states that it had almost been two Novembers since President Fowler had been elected, making the beginning set in 1990. Interestingly, the video game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six puts the atomic detonation in Denver as having occurred in 1989.
Debt of Honor (1995–1996) — The U.S. and Russia destroy all of their ballistic missiles. After crippling the U.S. economy and becoming a nuclear power, Japan invades and takes the Marianas Islands; the United States and Japan fight a brief war, which the Japanese lose (they are subsequently denuclearized); an embittered Japanese pilot and proponent of the war crashes a 747 into the United States Capitol Building immediately after Ryan's confirmation vote for the Vice President, killing most of the House and Senate, the President, all nine Supreme Court justices, the senior military establishment (including the JCS), and most of the Cabinet; Ryan is left in charge of a gutted government. The end of the book occurs eleven months before 1997 presidential inauguration. Of interest, but not crucial to the plot of this or further books is that North and South Korea were said to be unified at some point between The Sum of All Fears and this book.
Executive Orders (1996) — Saddam Hussein is assassinated; Iran and Iraq merge forming the United Islamic Republic; the UIR launches a biological attack on the U.S. using the Ebola virus; the United States launches the Second Persian Gulf War against the UIR and defeats them; the Ayatollah is killed in a smart-bomb attack by the U.S.
Rainbow Six (1999–2000) - events are based on the Sydney Olympics held in 2000, RAINBOW — an elite counter-terrorist force — is created and engages terrorists across Europe. Ecoterrorists plan to create a genetically-enhanced virus based on Ebola and cancer cells, which they plan to use to wipe out much of the world's population.
The Bear and the Dragon (2002) — Russia is admitted to NATO; China and Russia fight a major war, in which the U.S. intervenes on its NATO ally's side. It implies that the British Prime Minister is Tony Blair. Ryan has won election as president (2001-2004) but does not stand for reelection. His vice president Robby Jackson runs in 2004, but is killed just before the election giving Edward Kealty a "default" victory.
The Teeth of the Tiger (2006, based on the age of Jack Ryan, Jr.) The U.S. is now engaged in a global war on terrorism, in response to the September 11 attacks, which occurred in the Ryan universe as they did in the real world. It is mentioned that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq occurred in the Ryan universe continuity, and that the Jerusalem Treaty signed in The Sum of All Fears was not entirely successful as some Israelis and Palestinians continue fighting each other.
Dead or Alive (2007, based on Jack Ryan's announcement that he would run against Ed Kealty for President "in the coming year") — The Umayyad Revolutionary Council (the Ryan universe version of Al-Qaeda) and its leader "The Emir" (based on Osama bin Laden) plan a string of major attacks on the U.S. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue, as in our timeline, and President Kealty is in the process of withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. A character decoding encrypted messages explicitly refers to the date as May 2010, but this must be seen as a contradiction in the Jack Ryan continuity as Ed Kealty is a one term president (2005-2008).
Locked On (2007, based on Jack Ryan Sr.'s campaign for re-election). Jack Ryan Sr. is running for president against incumbent Edward Kealty, who wants to serve a second term (2009-2012). The election happening in this book requires the events take place in 2008. Kealty tries to dig up dirt on Ryan, i. e. John Clark's illegal activities. Meanwhile, a renegade Pakistani general steals nuclear weapons from his country and delivers them to rebel Dagestani forces. Jack Ryan Jr. and The Campus try to prevent the use of the lethal weapon and help Clark remain "invisible".
Threat Vector (2009, explicitly stated as six months after the previous novel.). Ryan Sr. has been sworn in as president of the United States after having been elected the previous year. The Red Chinese start a shooting war for control of the South China Sea. Using their cyber-warfare superiority, they have compromised US civilian, military, and intelligence systems (including the Campus) and Jack Ryan Jr.'s girlfriend.
The Tom Clancy Companion — Edited by Martin H. Greenberg — Writings by Clancy along with a concordance of all his fiction novels, detailing characters and military units or equipment.
In 1996, Clancy co-founded the video game developer Red Storm Entertainment and ever since he has had his name on several of Red Storm's most successful games. Red Storm was later bought by publisher Ubisoft Entertainment, which continued to use the Clancy name, though the extent of Clancy's actual involvement with creation of the games and development of intellectual properties, if any, was unclear.

=======================================================
Thomas Leo Clancy, Jr. was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and grew up in the city's Northwood neighborhood. His father was a letter carrier for the United States Postal Service; his mother worked in the credit department of a local store. From an early age, Tom Clancy was an active reader, with a deep interest in military history, particularly the work of naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison. The staunchly Catholic family made a great effort to ensure that young Tom was educated at Jesuit institutions, first at Loyola Blakefield in Towson, Maryland, then at Loyola College in Baltimore. In high school and college, he was active in chess clubs and debating societies. He joined the Army Reserve Officers Training Corps, but he was rejected for military service due to his extreme nearsightedness. He graduated from Loyola in 1969 with a degree in English literature. 
The year Tom Clancy graduated, he married Wanda Thomas King, a nursing student. Although he was already dreaming of becoming an author, he made the more practical choice after graduation of joining an insurance firm in Hartford, Connecticut, and he and Wanda started a family. They would eventually have four children. In 1973, Clancy took a job with the O.F. Bowen Agency, a small insurance firm, founded by Wanda's grandfather, in Owings, Maryland. Tom Clancy would remain a resident of his native state for the rest of his life.  
In 1980, Clancy purchased the agency from Wanda's mother and became his own employer. He still read military history, and he particularly enjoyed learning about the increasingly sophisticated weapons systems employed by the superpowers. When he read an article about the failed attempt of a Soviet ship's crew to mutiny and defect to the West, the story captured his imagination. Clancy saw this incident as the premise for a novel, a thriller that would draw hyper-realistic detail from his extensive reading. 
Clancy had never stopped dreaming of becoming a writer, and now that he could set his own hours, he began to write in the evenings and during spare moments at the office. Now 35, he had never seen a word of his work in print, other than a letter to the editor and a single three-page article on the MX missile, but he resolved to complete his novel and submit it for publication. In Clancy's tale, the Soviet vessel became a nuclear submarine; as a protagonist, he introduced the CIA agent Jack Ryan, who would appear in many of Clancy's later books.
It took two years for Clancy to complete his book, which he titled The Hunt for Red October. In 1985, he sent the completed manuscript to the Naval Institute Press, a small non-profit publisher based at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The press had never published a work of fiction before, but it was looking for a novel with a nautical theme, and it purchased the initial publishing rights for $5,000. The first printing sold 45,000 copies, one of which found its way to President Ronald Reagan. The President enjoyed the book and recommended it to his friends.  Reagan's endorsement attracted a wider audience, and soon the book had sold 300,000 copies in hardcover and two million in paperback. 
The formerly unknown insurance agent was now a bestselling author, and the technical accuracy of the book won praise from military experts. Clancy met high-ranking officers in the U.S. military, who facilitated his research for subsequent novels. By 1988, his first book had earned him $1.3 million in royalties, and he signed a $3 million contract for his next three books. Clancy retired from the insurance business and bought an 80-acre estate overlooking Chesapeake Bay in Calvert County, near the unincorporated town center of Huntingtown and the town of Prince Frederick. He also kept a large apartment in the Inner Harbor district of Baltimore. Despite his fascination with high technology and military technology, he suffered from a lifelong fear of flying and avoided air travel. 
Clancy's second novel, Red Storm Rising, published in 1986, depicted a hypothetical war between NATO and the Soviet Union. Patriot Games (1987) brought back the character of Jack Ryan, this time foiling a plot by Irish terrorists. In Cardinal of the Kremlin (1988), a sequel to Red October, Jack Ryan returns and Clancy introduces the character of John Clark, who would also appear in many of Clancy's tales. A Clear and Present Danger and The Sum of All Fears followed in 1989 and 1991. A Clear and Present Danger sold over 1.6 million copies in hardcover, making it the bestselling novel of the decade.
The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, A Clear and Present Danger and The Sum of All Fears became highly successful feature films, with the character of Jack Ryan played variously by actors Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck. Three of Clancy's first six novels had dealt in various ways with the Cold War rivalry of the Soviet Union and the United States. Others dealt with Middle Eastern terrorists and South American drug dealers. In October 1991, when Tom Clancy recorded his interview with the Academy of Achievement, the Soviet Union was in a state of collapse; it dissolved officially on December 25 of that year. Tom Clancy continued to produce thrillers at a steady pace throughout the 1990s, including Without Remorse, Debt of Honor and Executive Orders. His later novels were occasionally set in the Cold War past, but more often in a fanciful version of the near future, in which terrorist organizations attack the United States, Jack Ryan becomes President, and coups in Russia, China and Japan lead to renewed international conflict. 
In 1996, Clancy founded a video game company, Red Storm Entertainment, which produced a series of successful games based on Clancy's books and characters. The following year, the publisher Penguin Putnam agreed to pay Clancy $50 million for world rights to two new books, and $35 million to Red Storm Entertainment for a four-year book and multimedia deal. 
Tom and Wanda Clancy separated in 1996. Tom Clancy regularly attended the Academy of Achievement in the 1990s, as did General Colin Powell. At the Academy's 1997 gathering in Baltimore, General Powell introduced Clancy to journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn, the daughter of Powell's first cousin, businessman and philanthropist J. Bruce Llewellyn (1927-2010). Tom Clancy and Alexandra Llewellyn married in 1999, after his divorce became final. 
Clancy continued to pen bestsellers well into the 21st Century, including The Teeth of the Tiger (2003), Dead or Alive (2010), Locked On (2011) and Threat Vector (2012). He also published a series of non-fiction works: Guided Tours, focusing on different units of the U.S. military; and the Study in Command series, on recent U.S. military campaigns. In addition to his own novels, he licensed the use of his name for multiple book series written by others in his style. 
He often appeared on television to discuss national security affairs, and remained steadfastly loyal to his native city. He was a part owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team, active in the team's Community Activities and Public Affairs Committees. He died in Baltimore in 2012 at the age of 66. He was survived by the four children from his first marriage and one from his second, by his widow Alexandra, and by millions of fans around the world. His last novel, Command Authority, was scheduled for publication at the time of his death.

                Unable to pass the required eye exam, Clancy’s boyhood dreams of serving in the US military were transferred onto his literary ambitions. A lifelong military enthusiast, he is best known for writing techno-thrillers, complex novels dense with hardware and detailed geo-political themes.Thomas Leo Clancy was born on 12 April 1947 in Baltimore, Maryland and was educated at Loyola College, graduating in 1969. He married his first wife Wanda in the same year.  He worked as an insurance broker until he wrote his first novel in 1984, 'The Hunt for Red October', about the defection of a Russian submarine crew. The book made the New York Times best seller list, after President Ronald Reagan openly praised it. His first book was turned into the hit 1990 movie with the same name and starred Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.  This was followed by 'Red Storm Rising' in 1986 and 'Patriot Games' in 1987. The latter featured the CIA agent Jack Ryan, who first appeared in 'Red October', who foils an attack on the Prince and Princess of Wales.  'Patriot Games' was also turned into a hit film in 1992, with Harrison Ford playing the part of Ryan. In 1988, Clancy wrote 'The Cardinal in the Kremlin', in which Ryan forces the head of the KGB to defect.  Other Ryan novels include 'Clear and Present Danger' (1989), 'The Sum of All Fears' (1991), 'Without Remorse' (1993) 'Debt of Honor' (1994), 'Executive Orders' (1996), 'Rainbow Six' (1997) and 'The Bear and the Dragon' (2000), to name just a few.  'Clear and Present Danger' was adapted into a film in 1994, with Harrison Ford once again in the lead role, while 'The Sum of All Fears' was made into a movie starring Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman in 2002.  His crafting of plausible military scenarios is so realistic that he has become a favourite of the United States Military and Intelligence services. Pentagon officials regularly provide him with background material for new projects, and he was even offered a position as an unpaid consultant to the National Space Council.  Clancy's books have repeatedly earned No.1 rankings on the New York Times Bestseller list; nearly fifty million copies of his books have been printed, many have been made into movies, and they are even considered required reading at U.S. military academies. He is also a writer of military history, biography, and non-fiction guides to military hardware.  In 1996 Clancy founded Red Storm Entertainment, to create and market multimedia computer games based on his stories. This proved a hugely successful venture, and Clancy eventually sold the company for $45 million.  In 1999, he formally divorced Wanda, following their second separation in 1997. The same year, Clancy married freelance journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn.  In light of the events of September 11, 2001, Clancy's prescience in predicting future events was borne out by one of his novels, which featured a suicide attack against the U.S. Capitol Building by a terrorist flying a hijacked 747.  He has become a fixture on US lists of wealthiest entertainers, is co-owner of the Baltimore Orioles, and owns both his own railroad car and tank.  Clancy continues to write novels, and paperback editions of 'Tom Clancy Presents: Acts of Valour' and 'Locked On' featuring Jack Ryan were released in 2012. His latest novel is called 'Search and Destroy' and is set to be released in June 2012.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Tom Clancy became one of the best-selling writers of the late 20th and early 21st Centuries, starting with the publication of his 1984 thriller, The Hunt for Red October (1990). Born in Baltimore to a U.S. Post Office employee and his wife on April 12, 1947, Clancy graduated from Loyola Blakefield, a Catholic private high school, in 1965 and then attended Loyola College. After graduating with his bachelor's degree in English literature, Clancy went into the insurance business as poor eyesight kept him out of the military. Despite being unable to serve during the Vietnam War, military and Cold War politics remained close to his heart.While running his own insurance agency in Maryland, he wrote "The Hunt for Red October", which was published by the Naval Institute Press in 1984. Clancy received the princely sum of $5,000 from this most unusual venue for a work of fiction, but the book struck a nerve in the depths of the latter stages of the Cold War. The hardcover from the Naval Institute sold 45,000 copies, an amazing amount for a first novel from a publishing house peddling its first book of fiction, but the paperback -- boosted by a strong recommendation from President Ronald Reagan -- sold two million copies.The book was very detailed and extremely savvy when it came to the machinations of the military and Cold War politicians. In fact, Clancy's editor at the Naval Institute Press had him eliminate details, which trimmed the novel by 100 pages. In all, he wrote 28 books, mostly fiction but also, military themed non-fiction books. Clancy placed 17 books on the New York Times Best Seller List, many of which hit #1. His oeuvre accounted for sales of 100 million copies, making him one of the all-time most popular writers in history.Clancy became a media industry onto himself. He was successful lending his name and ideas to video games, and his video game company Red Storm Entertainment was bought out for $45 million in 2000. Clancy-branded video games racked up sales of 76 million units. Movies adapted from Clancy's works racked up $786.5 million at the box office.Tom Clancy died on October 1, 2013. he was 66 years old.
      Attended Loyola High School class of 1965 and Loyola College class of 1969. Major: English Literature.
      A woman in Washington, DC, read his novel "The Hunt For Red October" when it was first published by the Naval Press Institute in the 1980s, and loved it so much that she gave a copy to all her friends. One of those friends was President Ronald Reagan, who stepped off Marine One with the book tucked under his arm. A reporter saw the book and asked Reagan, "What are you reading?" Reagan then held up the book so everybody could see the cover and replied, "It's a really a good yarn." After Reagan's compliment, Tom Clancy's first novel became a best seller.
      He was an insurance salesman before becoming a full time author of military fiction and non-fiction. (He has never had any military or government experience)
      Due to the limited technology of the 1980s, his novel, "The Hunt For Red October," had to be saved on ten floppy disks.
      Dreamed of serving in the US military ever since he was a young boy. However, he failed to continue ROTC in college because he couldn't pass the required eye exam, crushing his hopes of ever serving in the army. (Loyola College required all students to enroll for two years of ROTC.)

With ten books ranking number 1 on The New York’s Times bestsellers list, Tom Clancy is a well liked and widely read author around the globe.

Thomas Leo Clancy, Jr. was born on April 12, 1947 in Baltimore, Maryland. After graduating from Loyola Blakefield in Towson, Maryland in 1965, Clancy attended Loyola College in Baltimore where he graduated in 1969. Also in 1969, Tom Clancy married a woman named Wanda who separated from Clancy for a brief period of time in 1995. The couple separated permanently a year later in December 1996. In November 1998, Wanda filed for a divorce which was finalized in 1999.
On the other side of his personal life, before realizing writing as a career Clancy worked as an insurance broker, running an independent insurance agency. A few years later the agency joined a group of investors including Peter Angelos. Clancy bought the Baltimore Orioles from Eli Jacobs.  Just when Clancy was about to reach an agreement to purchase the Minnesota Vikings to boost his insurance business, the settlement cost of his divorce came in the way and forced Clancy to abandon the agreement. On June 26, 1999, wedding bells rang for Clancy once again. This time, he married a freelance journalist, Alexandra Marie Llewellyn. The couple had met for the first time in 1997 and introduced to each other by Colin Powell who is a family friend of Alexandra’s father.

His writings have made an impression on many significant military and government personalities who have offered their friendship to him and also grant him access to submarines, aircrafts, and ships to help him collect material for his upcoming projects. His accurate representations have made many of his books a part of required reading materials as U.S military academies.
Some of Clancy’s most notable books include Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, the Sum of all Fears, Executive Orders, Rainbow Six, The Teeth of the Tiger, Dear or Alive, Locked On and Against all Enemies.

Thomas L. Clancy was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1947. His father, a mailman, and his mother, who worked in a department-store credit office, provided him with a middle-class upbringing. Toys, particularly toys featuring military technology, fascinated the young Clancy; he also became and remained a voracious reader.
Educated in Roman Catholic schools, Clancy attended Loyola College in Baltimore, majoring in English. He later said that he always wanted to see his name on a book, although he never imagined that he would become a best-selling author. While in college, he was a member of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), but poor eyesight kept him out of the regular military, much to his regret. He married Wanda Thomas in 1969, shortly after leaving college, and the need to support his growing family of eventually four children led him away from a literary career and into a more immediately financially rewarding occupation as an insurance agent, and he eventually joined his wife’s grandfather’s insurance agency in rural Maryland.
Clancy never abandoned his quest to become a writer. He had a science-fiction story rejected, and in the early 1970’s, he began plotting a novel, a work that contained characters that would eventually populate his published books. During those years he also continued his extensive reading, particularly in science fiction and military manuals. Although he did well in business, by the end of the decade he again turned to the task of getting his name on a book jacket.
In 1976, a naval mutiny occurred on a Soviet frigate, the mutineers hoping to defect to Sweden. The mutiny failed, but the incident gave Clancy the inspiration for his first published novel. Written during several months in late 1982 and early 1983, the unknown author’s The Hunt for Red October was published in 1984 by the Naval Academy’s Naval Institute Press, which...
  Clancy is only one of many writers who have used the background of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear conflict, international terrorism, and other contemporary concerns to attract a wide reading audience. Clancy, however, has joined those fears to military technology in a manner that his rivals have not; he might deny it, but he does write “techno-thrillers.” His first story was science fiction, and it was rejected. In a sense, though, he has been writing science fiction ever since—although it is science fiction that reflects the modern world rather than a future world. However, Clancy’s wars, in spite of his reliance on cutting-edge military technology, are not always realistic. There is no fog of war, and the Americans invariably know where the enemy is and what it will do. Clancy’s wars are invariably brief wars, with few casualties. It is not surprising that in 2004, Clancy became a vocal critic of the United States war against Iraq: The war did not follow his expected script of how wars should be fought and won.
Thomas Leo Clancy, Jr.’s father was a postman, and his mother worked in the credit department of Montgomery Ward. The young Clancy read Jules Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1872; originally published as Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, 1870) when he was in the third grade and later became an avid reader of military history. He started writing while in high school, graduating from Loyola Blakefield High in Towson, Maryland, in 1965. Clancy earned a bachelor’s degree from Loyola College in Baltimore in 1969, with a major in English literature. His fictional alter ego, Jack Ryan, also was born in Maryland and attended Catholic high schools and universities. Though he wanted to serve in the military, Clancy failed the eye examination. Ryan, on the other hand, was with the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps in college and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps after graduating. Clancy married Wanda Thomas, an insurance agency manager, in 1969, and they had four children, Michelle, Christine, Tom, and Kathleen. They were divorced in 1998. In 1999, Clancy married freelance journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn, a first cousin of former U.S. secretary of state Colin Powell, who introduced them.
Before Clancy sold his first novel, he sold insurance. Prior to The Hunt for Red October, his writings in professional publications consisted of a letter to the editor and an article on the MX missile, both...
Thomas L. Clancy, Jr., is often described as the “king of the technothriller,” a genre in which elements from science fiction and suspense combine with descriptions of advanced military technology to drive the plot. The second of three children, Clancy was born into an Irish American, working-class family in Baltimore. His father was a postman, and his mother was a department store credit clerk. Educated in parochial schools, Clancy, a self-described “nerd” who enjoyed playing military board games, was an avid reader, especially of military history books and science fiction. Poor eyesight kept Clancy from joining the military as had his father, a World War II Navy veteran, but he did join the ROTC while at Loyola College. There he majored in English and dreamed of becoming a famous novel writer. After graduation in 1969, Clancy married Wanda Thomas and became an insurance underwriter in Connecticut; he later worked at the insurance firm in Maryland owned by Wanda’s grandfather. The couple had three daughters and one son. In 1980 Clancy bought the family company, which afforded him some time to focus again on writing. (In 1998 Clancy and Thomas divorced, and in 2000 Clancy married former television newscaster Alexandra Maria Llewellyn.)
According to Helen S. Garson, author of Tom Clancy: A Critical Companion (1996), Clancy’s early love of science fiction combined with his fascination with military gadgets and technology, interest in computers, reverence for all things related to the military, and patriotic fervor to create a solid base for the genre for which he would become famous.
Like James A. Michener, famous for his in-depth research of people and places for novels such as Hawaii (1959) and Centennial (1974), Clancy writes his novels and nonfiction works after conducting extensive research in military technology, culled from such publications as the Armed Forces Weekly and Jane’s Defence Weekly, and collaborating with subject experts ranging from Soviet defectors to retired Air Force generals. The resulting best-sellers contain tremendous detail about terrorist operations, fleet maneuvers, military hardware, and intelligence technology.
Clancy based his first novel on the real-life attempted defection to Sweden by the crew of the Storojeroï, a Soviet frigate. After conducting extensive research on nuclear submarines, and with advice from then-naval analyst and computer war game expert Larry Bond, author of Red Phoenix...

  Tom Clancy is the voice of the Cold War. In the early 1980s, at nearly 40 years old, Clancy became a household name with his espionage novel The Hunt for Red October. The tale of a rogue Soviet submarine with nuclear capabilities perfectly captured the pre-Glasnost tension between the U.S.S.R and the U.S. The Hunt for Red October also launched the series that would define Clancy’s career. Its hero, Jack Ryan, along with his compatriot John Clark (introduced in a later novel), is the thread running through the Clancy canon. But having an enduring hero figure is only part of what makes Clancy’s spy tales must-read popular fiction: his intricate plotting and detailed depiction of intelligence work have kept Clancey on best-seller lists around the world.
Clancy is an avid sports fan and is currently a co-owner of the Baltimore Orioles. An attempt to acquire another team fell through in the wake of his divorce.
A longtime conservative, Clancy surprised many in the wake of the September 11th attacks by speaking on behalf of the Islamic faith.
In the mid-1990s, Clancy branched out into video games. His Red Storm Entertainment has produced dozens of games based on his work.
In addition to espionage books, Clancy has also authored many nonfiction works about various aspects of the military.
Although ghostwriting is a common practice for deceased writers, Clancy has made a fortune from this practice while still very much alive. His Op-Center and Net-Force series are ghostwritten by other authors.

He is certainly an honorary member of the military.  His books were so popular, especially in the navy, that he has been able to tour nuclear subs, aircraft carriers and has even been on patrol with one as a civilian adviser/observer.
He has published numerous non-fiction books on various military units (Armored Cav, for one), their equipment, history and how they work.  Rumor has it that after The Hunt for Red October, the White House had him debriefed to find out how he knew as much as he...

Tom Clancy was born April 12, 1947 in Baltimore, Maryland to Thomas, who worked as a mail carrier, and Catherine, who worked at a department store. He attended Loyola High School in Townson and graduated in 1965, going on to study at Loyola College in Baltimore. While there, he tried to join the U.S. Army Officersâ Training Corp, but failed his eye exam. He would study English literature in university and graduate in 1969. The summer after graduating, he married Wanda Thomas, an insurance agency manager. Clancy would take up a similar profession, working as an insurance agent. He worked for various firms, including ones in Baltimore and Connecticut, before he went to Owings, Maryland to work at a firm owned by his wifeâs grandfather. He would later purchase the family company in 1980.
Throughout the â70s and â80s, Clancy studied military tactics and technologies to provide a foundation for his true passion: writing. He published his first novel, The Hunt for Red October, in 1984 through the Naval Institute Press, a non-profit publisher that had never printed an original work of fiction. The novel initially gained traction through word-of-mouth, and was soon discovered by Michael Deaver â then-president Ronald Reaganâs confidante. Deaver liked the book so much he gave copies to most of the people in the West Wing. It eventually reached Reagan himself. He publicly commented out the book, describing it as âperfect yarn,â and the Cold War novel went on to become an unexpected bestseller. This attention and popularity also came with his second novel, Red Storm Rising (1986). He published Patriot Games and The Cardinal of Kremlin in 1988 and as the â80s drew to a close, he was heralded as one of the most popular and successful novelists of the decade.
In 1990, Tom Clancyâs first novel, The Hunt for Red October, was adapted into a film starring Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin as CIA analyst Jack Ryan. He continued writing in the 1990s, beginning the decade with The Sum of All Fears and Clear and Present Danger. Further film adaptations came in 1992 and 1994, as Harrison Ford portrayed Jack Ryan in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. Clancy was also be a part of a group of local investors that in 1993, purchased the Baltimore Orioles.
In 1996, Clancy founded video game developer Red Storm Entertainment. Their first game, Tom Clancyâs Politika, was released for PC in 1997, and in 1998, they published Rainbow Six. It would be the worldâs first tactical first-person shooter and was the first in a long line of successful sequels. In late 2000, the studio was purchased by Ubisoft Entertainment, but would maintain close ties to Tom Clancy, using his name in various titles they published, including Tom Clancyâs Spinter Cell and Tom Clancyâs Ghost Recon. The extent of Clancyâs involvement in these games is unknown. 
Film adaptations of his novels continued when The Sum Of All Fears was released in 2002. Ben Affleck took over from Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford in previous versions as the new Jack Ryan. The character has subsequently been adapted for the feature film Jack Ryan: Shadow Agent, directed by Kenneth Brannagh and starring Chris Pine as the titular character. It will be the first Jack Ryan film not to be based on any singular book; instead drawing inspirations from several of Clancyâs Jack Ryan novels.
 Clancy died at the age of 66 on October 3, 2012. He leaves behind a legacy that includes over 53 video games, five feature films and 25 books that have sold more than 100 million copies. He is survived by four children â his daughter Alexis with his second wife, Alexandra Llewellyn; and four children from a his prior marriage to Wanda King: Michelle, Christine, Kathleen and Thomas Clancy III.

"Whenever somebody comes up with a good idea, there's somebody else who has never had a good idea in his life who stands up and says, Oh, you can't do that." -- Tom ClancyThomas Leo "Tom" Clancy Jr. (born April 12, 1947) is an American author, best known for his technically detailed espionage, military science and techno thriller storylines set during and in the aftermath of the Cold War, and several MTV videos and UFOs along with video games which he did not work on, but which bear his name for licensing and promotional purposes. His name is also a brand for similar movie scripts written by ghost writers and many series of non-fiction books on military subjects and merged biographies of key leaders. He is also part-owner and Vice Chairman of Community Activities and Public Affairs of the Baltimore Orioles, a Major League Baseball team.Quotes   more »   « less"America is the most inventive country in the world because everybody has access to information.""Collaboration on a book is the ultimate unnatural act.""Fighting wars is not so much about killing people as it is about finding things out.

Before making his literary debut, he spent some time running an independent insurance agency. This agency thrived for a few years before joining a group of investors.Clancy and his first wife Wanda married in 1969, separated briefly in 1995, and permanently separated in December 1996. Wanda Clancy filed for divorce in November 1998, which became final in 1999.In 1993, Tom Clancy joined a group of investors that included Peter Angelos and bought the Baltimore Orioles from Eli Jacobs.

Bruce Llewellyn, and a family friend of Colin Powell, who originally introduced the couple to each other.In 2008, the use of Clancy's name was purchased by French video game manufacturer Ubisoft for an undisclosed sum.  It will be used in conjunction with video games and related products such as movies,and books.↑ Hide "Personal Life" Section ↑Political VIews   more »   « lessClancy has generally been regarded as a political conservative, and has donated over US$256,000 to Republican Party political candidates.A week after the 9/11 attack, on The O'Reilly Factor, Clancy stated that left-wing politicians in the United States were partly responsible for September 11 due to their gutting of the CIA. Clancy has also associated himself with General Anthony Zinni, a critic of the George W. Bush administration, and has been critical of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.Some of his books bear dedications to Republican political figures, most notably Ronald Reagan. In his novels, countries portrayed as hostile to the U.S. include the former Soviet Union, Syria, China, Iran, India, and Japan while Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom are shown as close allies of the USA.On September 11, 2001, Clancy was interviewed by Judy Woodruff on CNN. During the interview, he observed that Islam does not condone suicide. Among other observations during this interview, Clancy cited discussions he had with military experts on the lack of planning to handle a hijacked plane being used in a suicide attack and criticized the news media's treatment of the U.S. intelligence community. Clancy appeared again on PBS's Charlie Rose, where he debated Vice-Presidential candidate Senator John Edwards.↑ Hide "Political VIews" Section ↑Bibliography   more »   « lessThe Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, and The Sum of All Fears have been turned into commercially successful films with actors Alec Baldwin, Ben Affleck, and Harrison Ford as Clancy's most famous fictional character Jack Ryan, while his second most famous character John Clark has been played by actors Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber.

The first Op-Center novel was released to coincide with a 1995 NBC television mini-series of the same name  (Tom Clancy's Op-Center) starring Harry Hamlin and a cast of stars.  Though the mini-series didn't continue, the book series did, but it had little in common with the first mini-series other than the title and the names of the main characters.The website IMDB reports that Tom Clancy's novel Without Remorse is to be made into a movie and is expected to be released in 2011.With the release of The Teeth of the Tiger, Clancy introduced Jack Ryan's son and two nephews who were main characters.Clancy has written several nonfiction books about various branches of the U.S. armed forces (see non-fiction listing, below). Clancy has also branded several lines of books and video games with his name that are written by other authors, following premises or storylines generally in keeping with Clancy's works:
These are sometimes referred to by fans as "apostrophe" books; Clancy did not initially acknowledge that these series were being authored by others, only thanking the actual authors in the headnotes for their "invaluable contribution to the manuscript".In 1997, Clancy signed a book deal with Penguin Putnam Inc. (both part of Pearson Education), that paid him US$50 million for the world-English rights to two new books. He then signed a second agreement for another US$25 million for a four-year book/multimedia deal. Clancy followed this up with an agreement with Berkley Books for 24 paperbacks to tie in with the ABC television miniseries Tom Clancy's Net Force aired in the fall/winter of 1998. The Op-Center universe has laid the ground for the series of books written by Jeff Rovin, which was in an agreement worth US $22 million bringing the total value of the package to US$97 million. Clancy is currently writing a new novel set in the Jack Ryan/John Clark universe.All but two of Clancy's novels feature Jack Ryan or John Clark.
The Hunt for Red October (1984): Clancy's first published novel. CIA analyst Jack Ryan assists in the defection of a respected Soviet naval captain, along with the most advanced ballistic missile submarine of the Soviet fleet. The movie (1990) stars Alec Baldwin as Ryan and Sean Connery as Captain Ramius. Captain Mancuso is introduced here. Nearly every book after has Mancuso in ever increasing command of U.S. submarine forces.Red Storm Rising (1986): War between NATO and USSR. The basis of the combat game of the same name, this book is not a member of the Ryan story series (although the protagonist of the story has many similarities with Jack Ryan). He co-wrote it with Larry Bond.Patriot Games (1987): The first book that Clancy wrote, Patriot Games predates The Hunt for Red October in chronological order. Jack Ryan foils an attack in London on the Prince and Princess of Wales by the "Ulster Liberation Army". The ULA then attacks Ryan's Maryland home while he is hosting the Prince and Princess for dinner. The movie stars Harrison Ford as Ryan and Samuel L. Jackson as Robby Jackson.The Cardinal of the Kremlin (1988): First appearance of John Clark and Sergey Golovko. Ryan leads a CIA operation which forces the head of the KGB to defect. Other elements include anti-satellite lasers and other SDI-type weapons, and the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Major Alan Gregory is introduced here. (He appears later, updating SAM software in The Bear and the Dragon). Colonel Bondarenko also is introduced here. (He appears in later books offering advice to Golovko in "Executive Orders" and commanding the Russian Army defenses against China in its sequel "The Bear and the Dragon")Clear and Present Danger (1989): The President authorizes the CIA to use American military forces in a covert war against cocaine producers in Colombia. The operation is betrayed. Ryan meets John Clark as they lead a mission to rescue abandoned soldiers. Domingo "Ding" Chavez (Clark's protege in later novels) is one of the rescued soldiers. The movie (1994) stars Harrison Ford as Ryan, Willem Dafoe as Clark and Raymond Cruz as Chavez.The Sum of All Fears (1991): Arab terrorists find a nuclear weapon that had been lost by Israel, and use it to attack the United States. This nearly triggers a war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, due to the incompetence of the new President and his mistress with an anti-Ryan agenda. Ryan intervenes to avert the war. The 2002 movie stars Ben Affleck as Ryan, Liev Schreiber as Clark, and changes the identity and motivation of the terrorists to neo-Nazis.Without Remorse (1993): Without Remorse takes place during the Vietnam War, when Jack Ryan was a teenager. Ex-SEAL John Clark (then John Kelly) fights a bloody one-man war against drug dealers in Baltimore, attracting the attention of Jack's father Emmett, a Baltimore police detective. He also helps plan and execute a raid on a prisoner-of-war camp in North Vietnam. Clark joins the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).Debt of Honor (1994): A secret cabal of extreme nationalists gains control of Japan (having acquired some nuclear weapons), and start a war with the U.S. Ryan, now National Security Advisor, and Clark and Chavez, agents in Japan, help win the war. The Vice President resigns in a scandal, and the President appoints Ryan to replace him.  A vengeful, die-hard Japanese airline pilot then crashes a jetliner into the U.S. Capitol during a joint session of Congress attended by most senior U.S. government leaders, including the President.  Ryan thus becomes the new President through succession.Executive Orders (1996): This is the immediate sequel to Debt of Honor. President Ryan survives press hazing, an assassination attempt, and a biological warfare attack on the USA. Clark and Chavez trace the virus to a Middle Eastern madman, and the U.S. military goes to work.Strategies for Submarine Warfare (1996): Follows the missions of USS Cheyenne in a future war with China precipitated by China's invasion of the disputed Spratly Islands.  Also not a Ryanverse book, SSN is actually a loosely connected collection of "scenario" chapters in support of the eponymous computer game.Rainbow Six (1998): Released to coincide with the computer game of the same name. John Clark and Ding, who is now Clark's son-in-law, lead an elite multi-national anti-terrorist unit that combats a worldwide genocide attempt by eco-terrorists. (Jack Ryan is the U.S. President and only mentioned or referred to as either 'The President' or 'Jack'.)The Bear and the Dragon (2000): War between Russia and China. Ryan recognizes the independence of Taiwan, Chinese police officers kill a Roman Catholic Cardinal, and the American armed forces help Russia defeat a Chinese invasion of Siberia.Red Rabbit (2002): In the early 1980s, CIA analyst Ryan aids in the defection of a Soviet officer who knows of a plan to assassinate Pope John Paul II.The Teeth of the Tiger (2003): Jack Ryan's son, Jack Ryan Jr., becomes an intelligence analyst, and then a field consultant, for The Campus, an off-the-books intelligence agency with the freedom to discreetly assassinate individuals "who threaten national security", following the end of the Jack Ryan Sr. presidential administration. This book of the Jack Ryan series by Tom Clancy introduces Ryan's son and two nephews as heirs to his spook-legacy.Dead or Alive (2010): Clancy's newest novel, the story picks up where The Teeth of the Tiger left off with Jack Ryan Jr. and The Campus trying to catch a terrorist known as "The Emir".
