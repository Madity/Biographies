Amy L. Chua (traditional Chinese: 蔡美兒; simplified Chinese: 蔡美儿; pinyin: Cài Měi'ér, born October 26, 1962) is the John M. Duff, Jr. Professor of Law at Yale Law School. She joined the Yale faculty in 2001 after teaching at Duke Law School for 7 years. Prior to starting her teaching career, she was a corporate law associate at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. She specializes in the study of international business transactions, law and development, ethnic conflict, and globalization and the law and is noted for her parenting memoir, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.
Chua was born in Champaign, Illinois to ethnic Chinese from the Philippines of Hoklo parents who raised her in the Hokkien dialect of Fujian, China.[1] Amy's father, Leon O. Chua, is an Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and is a writer on nonlinear circuit theory and cellular neural networks, and is the discoverer of the memristor.[2] Chua's mother was born in China in 1936, before relocating to the Philippines at the age of two.[1] She subsequently converted to Catholicism in high school and graduated from the University of Santo Tomas, with a degree in chemical engineering, magna cum laude.[1]
Amy was raised as a Roman Catholic and lived in West Lafayette, Indiana.[3] When she was eight years old, her family moved to Berkeley, California. Chua went to El Cerrito High School and graduated magna cum laude with an A.B. in Economics from Harvard College in 1984. She obtained her J.D. cum laude in 1987 from Harvard Law School, where she was an Executive Editor of the Harvard Law Review.[4]
Chua has written four books: two studies of international affairs, a memoir and her latest on Ethnic-American culture.
Her first book, World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability (2003), explores the ethnic conflict caused in many societies by disproportionate economic and political influence of "market dominant minorities" and the resulting resentment in the less affluent majority. World on Fire, which was a New York Times Bestseller, selected by The Economist as one of the Best Books of 2003,[5] and named by Tony Giddens in The Guardian as one of the "Top Political Reads of 2003",[6] examines how globalization and democratization since 1989 have affected the relationship between market dominant minorities and the wider population.
Her second book, Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance – and Why They Fall (2007), examines seven major empires and posits that their success depended on their tolerance of minorities.
Her third book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, published in January 2011, is a memoir about her journey in strict parenting techniques which she describes as being typical for Chinese parents.[7] The book caused global debate about parenting and culture.[8]
Her latest book, The Triple Package: How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America, was published on February 4, 2014.[9] The book has attracted commentary because of purported cultural stereotyping.[10][11][12]
Chua lives in New Haven, Connecticut, and is married to Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld. She has two daughters, Sophia and Louisa ("Lulu").[13] Chua, whose husband is Jewish, has stated that her children can speak Chinese, and they have been "raised Jewish".[14] She is the eldest of four sisters: Michelle, Katrin, and Cynthia. Katrin is a physician and a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine.[15] Cynthia, who has Down Syndrome, holds two International Special Olympics gold medals in swimming.[15][16]

Hi, I’m Amy Chua, and thanks so much for visiting my website!  Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is the story of my family’s journey in two cultures.
I wrote this book in a moment of crisis, when my younger daughter seemed to turn against everything I stood for and it felt like I was losing her and everything was falling apart.  After one terrible fight, I sat down at my computer, and even though I usually have writer’s block, this time the words just poured out.  I showed every page to my daughters and my husband.  It was like family therapy.  In retrospect, I think writing the book – going back eighteen years when my elder daughter was born and I was a very different person – was an attempt to put the pieces back together and work things out for myself . . . and the story is unfinished!
I was raised by very strict, Chinese immigrant parents, who came to the U.S. as graduate students with practically no money.  My mother and father were so poor they couldn’t afford heat their first two winters in Boston, and wore blankets around to keep warm.  As parents, they demanded total respect and were very tough with my three younger sisters and me.  We got in trouble for A minuses, had to drill math and piano every day, no sleepovers, no boyfriends.  But the strategy worked with me.  To this day, I’m very close to my parents, and I feel I owe them everything.  In fact, I believe that my parents having high expectations for me – coupled with love – is the greatest gift anyone has ever given me.  That’s why I tried to raise my own two daughters the same way my parents raised me.
With my first daughter, Sophia, things went smoothly.  But then my second daughter, Lulu, came along – she’s a real fireball; we have very similar personalities – and I got my come-uppance.  We locked horns from day one, and at thirteen, she rebelled.  This book is basically the story of my own transformation as a mother.  It’s not a parenting book; it’s a memoir.  It’s also supposed to be funny, filled with zany showdowns between me and daughters, who have all the best lines and are always calling my bluff.
With all that said, the book does have a point of view.  While I definitely have regrets, if I had to raise my girls all over again, I guess I would basically do the same thing, with some adjustments.  I’m not holding myself out as a model, but I do believe that we in America can ask more of children than we typically do, and they will not only respond to the challenge, but thrive.  I think we should assume strength in our children, not weakness.  And I think it is 100% All-American to do so!
Jokes aside about A+s and gold medals (much of my book is self-parody), in the end for me it’s not about grades or Ivy League schools.  It’s about believing in your child more than anyone else – more than they believe in themselves – and helping them realize their potential, whatever it may be.  My youngest sister, Cindy, has Down Syndrome, and I remember my mother spending hours and hours with her, teaching her to tie her own shoelaces, drilling multiplication tables, practicing piano every day with her.  My mom wanted her to be the best she could be, within her limits. Today, Cindy works at Walmart, has a boyfriend, and still plays piano – one of her favorite things is performing for her friends. She and my mom have a wonderful relationship, and we all love her for who she is.
My book has been controversial.  Many people have misunderstood it.  If I could push a magic button and choose either happiness or success for my children, I’d choose happiness in a second.  But I don’t think it’s as simple as that; it can be a tough world out there, and true self-esteem has to be earned.
I genuinely believe that there are many ways of being a good parent.  We all want our kids to grow up happy, strong, and self-reliant.  But different cultures have very different ideas about the best way to do that.  And we should all be able to learn from each other.

What makes for a successful workforce? Why do some groups — cultures, countries — consistently succeed more than others? These questions, both on an international and on a personal level, are at the heart of Amy Chua's work.
Her newest book, The Triple Package, investigates these issues on a demographic scale. Subtitled How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America, this book draws on groundbreaking original research and startling statistics to explain why some groups in America do better than others. What's their secret? It's the combination of a superiority complex, insecurity, and impulse control — the "triple package" of cultural traits that drives disproportionate group success.
Amy's previous book, the bestselling Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, looked at the same questions of culture and success at the family level. A memoir of Amy's experience as a parent, it's also an argument about the different consequences of traditional Chinese and American parenting. An awe-inspiring, often hilarious, and unerringly honest story of one mother's exercise in extreme parenting, Tiger Mother discusses the rewards-and the costs-of raising her children the Chinese way. The book has been translated into 30 languages.
Amy is also the author of World on Fire, which argues that, surprisingly, democracy and free markets are not always mutually reinforcing outside the Western world. The book helps makes sense of the Arab Spring and some of the more troubling developments in the Middle East. World on Fire was a New York Times and BusinessWeek bestseller and one of The Economist's Best Books of 2003.
Her earlier Day of Empire examines history’s handful of dominant world powers to reveal the reasons behind their success and the roots of their ultimate demise.

It may be taboo to say, but some groups in America do better than others. Mormons have recently risen to astonishing business success. Cubans in Miami climbed from poverty to prosperity in a generation. Nigerians earn doctorates at stunningly high rates. Indian and Chinese Americans have much higher incomes than other Americans; Jews may have the highest of all.
Why do some groups rise? Drawing on groundbreaking original research and startling statistics, The Triple Package uncovers the secret to their success. A superiority complex, insecurity, impulse control — these are the elements of the Triple Package, the rare and potent cultural constellation that drives disproportionate group success. The Triple Package is open to anyone. America itself was once a Triple Package culture. It’s been losing that edge for a long time now. Even as headlines proclaim the death of upward mobility in America, the truth is that the old fashioned American Dream is very much alive — but some groups have a cultural edge, which enables them to take advantage of opportunity far more than others.
Americans are taught that everyone is equal, that no group is superior to another. But remarkably, all of America’s most successful groups believe (even
Americans are taught that self-esteem — feeling good about yourself — is the key to a successful life. But in all of America’s most successful groups,
America today spreads a message of immediate gratification, living for the moment. But all of America’s most successful groups cultivate heightened discipline and impulse control.
But the Triple Package has a dark underside too. Each of its elements carries distinctive pathologies; when taken to an extreme, they can have truly toxic effects. Should people strive for the Triple Package? Should America? Ultimately, the authors conclude that the Triple Package is a ladder that should be climbed and then kicked away, drawing on its power but breaking free from its constraints.
Provocative and profound, The Triple Package will transform the way we think about success and achievement.
An awe-inspiring, often hilarious, and unerringly honest story of one mother's exercise in extreme parenting, revealing the rewards-and the costs-of raising her children the Chinese way.
All decent parents want to do what's best for their children. What Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother reveals is that the Chinese have a totally different idea of how to do that. Western parents try to respect their children's individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions and providing a nurturing environment. The Chinese believe that the best way to protect your children is by preparing them for the future and arming them with skills, strong work habits, and inner confidence. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother chronicles Chua's iron-willed decision to raise her daughters, Sophia and Lulu, her way-the Chinese way-and the remarkable results her choice inspires. 
Chua demands as much of herself as she does of her daughters. And in her sacrifices-the exacting attention spent studying her daughters' performances, the office hours lost shuttling the girls to lessons-the depth of her love for her children becomes clear. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is an eye-opening exploration of the differences in Eastern and Western parenting- and the lessons parents and children everywhere teach one another.
The thesis of Day of Empire, like the thrust of her previous book [World on Fire], is provocative. Chua’s lively writing makes her case studies interesting in themselves. And her convincing presentation of their relevance to the contemporary scene adds meaning to this timely warning.   
In a little over two centuries, America has grown from a regional power, to a great power, to a superpower, to what is today called a hyperpower. But can America retain its position as the world's dominant power, or has it already begun to decline? 
Historians have debated the rise and fall of empires for centuries. To date, however, no one has studied the far rarer phenomenon of hyperpowers — those remarkably few societies that have amassed such extraordinary military and economic might that they essentially dominated the world. 
Now, in this sweeping history of globally dominant empires, bestselling author Amy Chua explains how hyperpowers rise and why they fall. 
In a series of brilliantly focused chapters, Chua examines history's hyperpowers — Persia, Rome, Tang China, the Mongols, the Dutch, the British, and the United States — and reveals the reasons behind their success, as well as the roots of their ultimate demise. 
Chua's unprecedented study reveals a fascinating historical pattern. For all their differences, she argues, every one of these world-dominant powers was, at least by the standards of its time, extraordinarily pluralistic and tolerant. Each one succeeded by harnessing the skills and energies of individuals from very different backgrounds, and by attracting and exploiting highly talented groups that were excluded in other societies. Thus Rome allowed Africans, Spaniards, and Gauls alike to rise to the highest echelons of power, while the "barbarian" mongols conquered their vast domains only because they practiced and ethnic and religious tolerance unheard of in their time. In contrast, Nazi Germany and imperial Japan, while wielding great power, failed to attain global dominance as a direct result of their racial and religious intolerance. 
But Chua also uncovers a great historical irony: In virtually every instance, multicultural tolerance eventually sowed the seeds of decline, and diversity became a liability, triggering conflict, hatred, and violence. 
The United States is the quintessential example of a power that rose to global dominance through tolerance and diversity. The secret to America's success has always been its unsurpassed ability to attract enterprising immigrants. Today, however, concerns about outsourcing and uncontrolled illegal immigration are producing a backlash against our tradition of cultural openness. Has America finally reached a "tipping point"? Have we gone too far in the direction of diversity and tolerance to maintain cohesion and unity? Will we be overtaken by rising powers like China, the EU or even India? 
Chua shows why American power may have already exceeded its limits — and why it may be in our interest to retreat from our go-it-alone approach and promote a new multilateralism in both domestic and foreign affairs.
"Scintillating history, breathtaking in scope and chock-full of insight. Amy Chua argues persuasively that the real key to acquiring and maintaining great power lies in the ability to attract and assimilate, rather than to coerce or intimidate."  
"Amy Chua smartly condenses the complex histories of the Persian, Mughal, Dutch, and other empires into an irresistable argument: that empires expand through toleration and contract through close-mindedness. As with any shrewd and elaborate argument, the getting there is half the fun."
"From ancient Achaemenid Persia to the modern United States, by way of Rome, Tang China and the Spanish, Dutch and British Empires, Amy Chua tells the story of the world's hyperpowers — that elite of empires which, in their heyday, were truly without equal. Not everyone will be persuaded by her ingenious thesis that religious and racial tolerance was a prerequisite for global dominance, but also the slow solvent of that cultural 'glue' which holds a great nation together. But few readers will fail to be impressed by the height of this book's ambition and by the breadth of scholarship on which it is based."  
A fundamentally new perspective on how to sustain globalization by finding ways to spread its benefits while curbing its destructive unintended consequences.
Every few years, a book is published about America's role in the world and the changing contest of global affairs that gets everyone thinking in a new way. Amy Chua's World On Fire will have exactly that kind of impact on the debate of how the world has changed in light of the events of last September. 
Apostles of globalization, such as Thomas Friedman, believe that exporting free markets and democracy to other countries will increase peace and prosperity throughout the developing world; Amy Chua is the anti-Thomas Friedman. Her book wil be a dash of cold water in the face of globalists, techno-utopians, and liberal triumphalists as she shows that just the opposite has happened: When global markets open, ethnic conflict worsens and politics turns ugly and violent. 
Drawing on examples from around the world — from Africa and Asia to Russia and Latin America — Chua examines how free markets do not spread wealth evenly throughout the whole of these societies. Instead they produce a new class of extremely wealthy plutocrats — individuals as rich as nations. Almost always members of a minority group — Chinese in the Philippines, Croatians in the former Yugoslavia, whites in Latin America, Indians in East Africa, Jews in post-communist Russia — these "market-dominant minorities" have become targets of violent hatred. Adding democracy to this volatile mix unleashes supressed ethnic hatreds and brings to power ethnonationalist governments that pursue aggressive policies of confiscation and revenge. Chua further shows how individual countries are often viewed as dominant minorities, explaining the phenomena of ethnic resentment in the Arab-Israeli conflict and the rising tide of anti-American sentiment around the world. This more than anything accounts for the visceral hatred of Americans that has been expressed in recent acts of terrorism. 
Bold and original, World On Fire is a perceptive examination of the far-reaching effects of exporting capitalism with democracy and its potentially catastrophic results.
Amy tailors each presentation to the needs of her audience and is not limited to the topics we have listed below. These are subjects that have proven valuable to customers in the past and are meant only to suggest her range and interests. Please ask us about any subject that interests you; we are sure that we can accommodate you.
The nation’s viability to compete rests on our future workforce. Leaders who will drive global, competitive agendas require competencies first learned at home. Parenting plays a key role in ensuring that the next generation performs with the drive, agility and determination required in a new economic paradigm.
A Chinese-American, Harvard educated lawyer, Yale professor, best-selling author, and parent of two, Amy Chua will draw on recent works as she shares insights on parenting in the United States and its effects on the workforce in an increasingly complex and globalized business environment.
Your thoughtfulness in your presentation for our particular group was apparent and we appreciate all that you did to engage the audience. As you saw and heard from the book signing line, our attendees were both inspired and motivated by your remarks. We also appreciate the time you took to spend with our staff and board members after your presentation and session — how very gracious of you! 
The Amy Chua lecture went really splendidly. She arrived promptly, the speech was excellent, lots of Q & A. We had over 500 people attend. Our University President [...] and his wife attended. The bookstore sold a lot of books. It was a great night. Amy couldn't have been more gracious. She is amazing. 
She is really nice and did an awesome presentation. Everyone loved it —Jane [McGonigal] was phenomenal as well. She had time to sit in some of the other sessions too. She is a gem and everyone loved her as well. I can’t say enough about either of them. Great presentations-very friendly and accommodating-so easy to work with. They are both excellent speakers and had jam packed rooms! Jane also did a great job with the panel discussion. 
[Amy] was absolutely the hit of our conference. I can not count the number of people who approached me to tell me how highly they thought of her remarks. The animated and passionate delivery of her complex theories was spellbinding. You could literally have heard a pin drop in a room filled with slightly over 500 people. [...] This was truly a treat for an audience who is involved in the international arena through their work and most interested in the dynamics involved with issues of globalization. The buzz was that her name would be brought forward for invitation at an National Conference of our organisation.
From my perspective, Dr. Chua provided the perfect questioning and intelligent analysis of local issues raised by globalization. She was dynamic and poised and raised difficult questions with grace and rigor. One of my most trusted colleagues said to me later that her presentation was the most tough-minded of all that he heard at the conference. In short, she fulfilled her function in the fabric of the program and exceeded my expectations in every way. We were pleased to have her.
Amy's presentation was very well received. Our students found her to be very intelligent and extremely dynamic as a speaker--as did I, as well. 
I appreciated the fact that she was fully engaged with our students and faculty during our dinner, and she made herself available for about 45 minutes after the program ended to talk to our students individually. My sense is that the female students, in particular, saw her as an excellent role model; someone who is a very high achiever, and yet is also friendly, accessible and humorous. 
I want to let you know that we finished the first half with great success. The audience absolutely loved hearing Professor Chua speak this morning at the lecture and afterward at the VIP luncheon where she answered questions with great aplomb. 
My email inbox is already filled with great messages about how much the morning audience appreciated hearing from such a distinguished, brilliant young woman. 
The Town Hall commitee looks forward to this evening with Professor Chua. We are enjoying her visit very much!

=======================================================
Has Tiger Mom gone soft? One year after the release of her controversial memoir, "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother," Amy Chua is back in the spotlight, reflecting on how overnight infamy affected her life, her family -- and her parenting.
"I've changed a lot," she told The Huffington Post. "In October, we had 30 kids at our house! [We've hosted] co-ed parties with lots of food and music." 
Lest anyone forget, here's how it all started. Last January, the Wall Street Journal published an excerpt from Chua's book with the headline "Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior." In the excerpt, Chua described how her daughters were never allowed to have sleepovers, appear in school plays, earn any grade lower than an A or have play dates with friends. A firestorm of criticism -- and more than a few jokes -- ensued. Chua, an author and professor at Yale Law School, spent much of 2011 on the defensive. In fact, many of her interviews seemed to lend fuel to her critics' fire. 
Now, with the book out in paperback, the note Chua keeps hitting is that "Battle Hymn" was always meant as a memoir, not a manual.
Many of the scenes she described in the book are a far cry from the child-raising tactics she advocates. She said, "I put passages in the book and used very harsh words that I regret. Everybody has those moments you wish you could take back." 
For those who still read "Battle Hymn" as an advice manual, Chua argues that so-called tiger parenting should be employed predominantly during a child's early years, ideally between the ages of 5 and 12. These "super-strict parenting tactics" are not meant for all ages. 
Remaining strict after middle school makes you a helicopter parent, according to Chua. And she is quick to point out how different that is from being a tiger mom.
"By the time [kids] get to high school, helicopter parents are hiring all these tutors, carrying their kids' sports bags. I never checked [older daughter Sophia's] papers because I knew she knew how to sit down and focus," Chua said. "I know she is going to make mistakes in college ... but I'm so much more comfortable knowing that she's gonna make those mistakes at 19, not 13," Chua added.
As for younger daughter Lulu, 15, the rebel for whom the book was ostensibly written, Chua has really backed off. 
Instead of forcing Lulu to practice violin for hours a day -- the source of their biggest fights -- Chua "let her give that up," she said. (Although she still argues for 15 minutes of practice time every few days.) "My compromise is that I'm going to still be as strict academically, but in exchange she has a lot of social freedom. Lulu has had four sleepovers in the last two months!" Chua said."
Chua predicts she'll only get more easygoing with age. When asked what type of grandparent she'll be, she laughed. "If my parents are any evidence, [I'll] be the softest kitty cat. ... They come to our house and buy my kids presents and stuff them with ice cream and brownies. My prediction is that I'll be on the extreme soft end," she said.

Amy L. Chua was born October 26, 1962, in Champaign, Illinois. Her Chinese immigrant parents came to the United States from the Philippines in 1961, eloping together to pursue advanced degrees at MIT. They were extremely strict, but loving. Amy Chua was the eldest of four girls. Amy and her sisters Michelle, Katrin, and Cynthia (Cindy) were raised in the Roman Catholic faith, and lived in West Lafayette, Indiana. Chua recalls that her father worked until three in the morning to make a good life for his family, and that he took great pleasure in introducing his family to American pastimes and activities such as tacos, Sloppy Joes, Dairy Queen, sledding, skiing, camping. The day her parents became naturalized citizens is a moment Amy Chua recalls with great pride.Her parents both grew up in the Philippines under Japanese occupation, and came to the States after celebrating liberation under General Douglas MacArthur. Although her father's family was very wealthy, her mother came from a poor but intellectual family. The Chua family's re–enactment of the American dream is a theme woven through Chua's second book. Her father, Leon Ong Chua, was born June 28, 1936. After earning his first degree in the Philippines in 1959, he came to the United States on a scholarship, eventually completing his PhD at the University of Illinois in 1964.While the family lived in Indiana, he was an academic at Purdue University. When Amy was eight years old, the family moved to Berkeley, California, where Leon Chua became Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences professor at the University of California in Berkeley. He is known for formulating the Memristor theory in 1971, a method of memory resistance through use of a passive two–terminal electrical component. He is also considered the father of nonlinear circuit theory and cellular neural networks, and invented Chua's circuit. He has since been awarded eight honorary doctorates, and remains active in research and writing.

He is also considered the father of nonlinear circuit theory and cellular neural networks, and invented Chua's circuit. He has since been awarded eight honorary doctorates, and remains active in research and writing.Amy considers her growing up years with her sisters to be fairly typical of a Chinese immigrant family, where hard work was the norm. During their first two years in Boston, they couldn't afford heat, and wore blankets for warmth. Her parents were tough and demanded total respect and dedication to work. The children did not enjoy the same degree of freedom their friends did. They got in trouble for A minuses, were subjected to piano and math drills daily, and were not allowed sleepovers or boyfriends. Amy and her sisters were not allowed to go to school dances or other activities. However, she remembers great times shared with her family.Amy attended El Cerrito High School in Berkeley, then applied and was accepted to Harvard College. Her parents had high hopes that she would excel in the sciences, so she started out in pre–med hoping to please them. She soon realized she was not going to be a scientist, so she moved into economics instead. In 1984, she graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with an AB in Economics. From there she became interested in international law, issues of developing countries, and cultural issues, largely due to her own experience in a family of immigrants and outsiders. In 1987 she earned a J.D. cum laude from Harvard Law School.When in grade school a boy made fun of the shape of her eyes and the way she pronounced certain words, leading her to vow to get rid of her Chinese accent. The family struggled with the process of assimilating while maintaining ethnic identity to the extent that Amy's father, when she was four years old, told her "you will marry a non–Chinese over my dead body." The theme of strict, but loving family, where everyone worked hard together to achieve a dream for the family is one that runs through all of Chua's books. She observes that as a family, they started off as outsiders together and became Americans in the process.
