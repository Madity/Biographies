Alexander Rae "Alec" Baldwin III (born April 3, 1958)[1] is an American actor, film producer and comedian who has appeared on film, stage and television. As a member of the Baldwin family, he is the eldest of the four Baldwin brothers, all well-known actors.
Baldwin first gained recognition appearing on seasons 6 and 7 of the CBS television drama Knots Landing, in the role of Joshua Rush. He has since played both leading and supporting roles in films such as Beetlejuice (1988), The Hunt for Red October (1990), The Marrying Man (1991), The Shadow (1994), The Aviator (2004) and The Departed (2006). His performance in the 2003 film The Cooler garnered him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
From 2006 to 2013, he starred as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock, receiving critical acclaim for his performance and winning two Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards and seven Screen Actors Guild Awards for his work on the show, making him the male performer with the most SAG Awards.
Baldwin is a columnist for The Huffington Post. He was host of MSNBC's Up Late with Alec Baldwin, which lasted for five episodes until he was fired on November 26, 2013.[2]
Baldwin was born in Amityville, Long Island, New York, and raised in nearby Massapequa, both on Long Island,[1][3][4][5] the eldest son of Carol Newcomb (née Martineau) and Alexander Rae Baldwin, Jr. (October 26, 1927 – April 15, 1983),[6] a high school history/social studies teacher and football coach.[1] Alec and his siblings were raised as Roman Catholics.[7] They are of English, Irish, Scottish, French, and German ancestry.[8][9] He has three younger brothers, Daniel, William and Stephen, who also became actors. He also has two sisters, Beth and Jane.[10]
Baldwin attended Alfred G. Berner High School in Massapequa[9] and played football there under Coach Bob Reifsnyder, who is in the College Football Hall of Fame. In New York City, Baldwin worked as a busboy at the famous disco nightclub Studio 54. From 1976 to 1979, he attended George Washington University, afterwards transferring to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he studied with, among others, Geoffrey Horne and Mira Rostova at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute,[3] and, later still, being accepted as a member of the Actors Studio.[11] Baldwin eventually returned to NYU in 1994, graduating with a BFA in that year.
Baldwin made his Broadway debut in 1986, in a revival of Joe Orton's Loot alongside Zoë Wanamaker, Željko Ivanek, Joseph Maher and Charles Keating.[12] This production closed after three months. His other Broadway credits include Caryl Churchill's Serious Money with Kate Nelligan and a revival of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, for which his performance as Stanley Kowalski garnered a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor. Baldwin also received an Emmy nomination for the 1995 television version of the production, in which both he and Jessica Lange reprised their roles, alongside John Goodman and Diane Lane. In 1998, Baldwin played the title role in Macbeth at The Public Theater alongside Angela Bassett and Liev Schreiber in a production directed by George C. Wolfe. In 2004, Baldwin starred in a revival of Twentieth Century with Anne Heche.
On June 9, 2005, he appeared in a concert version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific at Carnegie Hall. He starred as Luther Billis, alongside Reba McEntire as Nellie and Brian Stokes Mitchell as Emile. The production was taped and telecast by PBS on April 26, 2006. In 2006, Baldwin made theater news in Roundabout Theatre Company's Off-Broadway revival of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr. Sloane. In 2010, Baldwin starred opposite Sam Underwood in a critically acclaimed revival of Peter Shaffer's Equus, directed by Tony Walton at Guild Hall in East Hampton, New York.[citation needed]
Baldwin has returned to Broadway as Harold in Orphans. The show, which opened April 18, 2013, was also to have starred Shia LaBeouf as Treat,[13] but LaBoeuf left the production in rehearsals and was replaced by Ben Foster.[14][15]
Baldwin's first acting role was as Billy Aldrich in the NBC daytime soap opera The Doctors from 1980 to 1982. In fall 1983, he starred in the short-lived television series Cutter to Houston. He went on to appear as the brother of Valene Ewing and son of Lilimae Clements (played by Joan Van Ark and Julie Harris, respectively) in Knots Landing from 1984–85. In 1986, Baldwin starred in Dress Gray, a four-hour made-for-television miniseries, as an honest cadet sergeant who tries to solve the mystery of a murdered gay classmate.[16] In 1998, he became the third narrator and George Carlin's replacement for the fifth and sixth seasons of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends. He left the series in 2003 on winning the role of Lawrence Quinn in The Cat in the Hat and was replaced by Michael Brandon.
In 2002, Baldwin appeared in two episodes of Friends as Phoebe Buffay's overly enthusiastic love interest, Parker. He also portrayed a recurring character in a number of episodes in seasons 7 and 8 of Will & Grace, in which he played Malcolm, a "top secret agent" and the lover of Karen Walker (Megan Mullally). He also guest-starred in the first live episode of the series. Baldwin wrote an episode of Law & Order entitled "Tabloid", which aired in 1998. He played Dr. Barrett Moore, a retired plastic surgeon, in the series Nip/Tuck. He starred as Jack Donaghy on NBC's 30 Rock, which first aired October 2006. He met his future co-stars Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan while appearing on Saturday Night Live, and is one of only two actors to whom Lorne Michaels has extended a standing offer to host the show should their schedules permit (the other being Christopher Walken). Since season 3, Baldwin was credited as producer of the show.
Baldwin has won two Emmy Awards,[17] two Golden Globe awards and seven Screen Actors Guild Awards for his role. He received his second Emmy nomination for Best Actor in a Television Comedy or Musical as Jack Donaghy in 2008, marking his seventh Primetime Emmy nomination and first win. He won again in 2009.[citation needed]
Baldwin joined TCM's The Essentials Robert Osborne as co-host beginning in March 2009.[18][19] In 2009, he appeared in a series of commercials for Hulu that premiered during the Super Bowl broadcast.[citation needed] In 2010, he made a five-second cameo appearance with comedian Andy Samberg in a musical video titled "Great Day" featured on the bonus DVD as part of Lonely Island's album Turtleneck & Chain.[citation needed]
Baldwin co-hosted the 82nd Academy Awards with Steve Martin in 2010.[20] He has hosted Saturday Night Live 16 times through the season-37 premiere on September 24, 2011, and holds the record for most times hosting the show.[21] Since 2010, he has appeared in a television campaign for Capital One Bank, the proceeds of which ($10.5 million) he has donated to various charities, mostly in the arts.[citation needed] On February 4, 2012, he hosted the 2011 NFL Honors awards show.[22] He also hosted the second show on February 2, 2013.[23]
In August 2013, it was announced that Baldwin was getting his own weekly show in MSNBC's primetime line-up. It was set to run on Friday at 10 p.m. ET.[24] On September 5, 2013, MSNBC officially announced Baldwin's show would be called Up Late with Alec Baldwin.[25] On November 26, 2013, the program was cancelled after only five episodes,[2] due in part to a street tirade captured on video. TMZ claimed Baldwin's unintelligible insult toward the videographer was "cocksucking fag".[26] Although the video clearly shows Baldwin mumbling "cocksucking f....", the second word in his insult is unclear. He was fired for this incident anyway.[27][28] Baldwin, who denied that he used the word "fag", later cited this incident as a major turning point in his public life.[29]
Baldwin made his film debut with a minor role in the 1987 film Forever, Lulu. In 1988, he appeared in Beetlejuice and Working Girl. He gained further recognition as a leading man with his role as Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October (1990).
Baldwin met his future wife Kim Basinger when they played lovers in the 1991 film The Marrying Man. Next, Baldwin played a ferocious sales executive in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), a part added to the film version of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning stage play (including the monologue "Coffee's for closers"). Later that year, he starred in Prelude to a Kiss with Meg Ryan, which was based on the Broadway play. The film received a lukewarm reception by critics and grossed only $22 million worldwide.[30] In 1993, he starred with Nicole Kidman in the thriller Malice. He appeared with Basinger again in The Getaway, a 1994 remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen film of the same name.
Also in 1994, Baldwin made a foray into pulp fiction-based movies with the role of the title character in The Shadow. The film made $48 million. In 1996 and 1997, he continued to work in several thrillers, including The Edge, The Juror and Heaven's Prisoners.
Baldwin shifted towards character acting, beginning with Pearl Harbor in 2001. He played Lt. Col. James Doolittle in the film. With a worldwide box office of $449,220,945, this film remains the highest-grossing film Baldwin has appeared in during his acting career.[31] Baldwin was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance in the 2003 gambling drama The Cooler.[3] He appeared in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004) and The Departed (2006).[3] In 2006, he starred in the film Mini's First Time. He performed opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar in Suburban Girl (2007). Two years later, he co-starred in the hit romantic comedy It's Complicated with Meryl Streep and Steve Martin.
Baldwin directed and starred in The Devil and Daniel Webster with Anthony Hopkins, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Dan Aykroyd in 2001.[32] The then-unreleased film became an asset in a federal bank fraud trial, when investor Jed Barron was convicted of bank fraud while the movie was in production. The film was eventually acquired by The Yari Group without Baldwin's involvement.[33]
In 2007, the Yari Film Group announced that it would give the film, now titled Shortcut to Happiness, a theatrical release in the spring, and cable film network Starz! announced that it had acquired pay TV rights for the film. Shortcut to Happiness was finally released in 2008. Baldwin, displeased with the way the film had been cut in post-production, demanded that his directorial credit be changed to the pseudonym "Harry Kirkpatrick".[34]
On January 12, 2009, Baldwin became the host of The New York Philharmonic This Week, the nationally broadcast radio series of the New York Philharmonic.[35] He has recorded two nationally-distributed public service radio announcements on behalf of the Save the Manatee Club.[36]
On October 24, 2011, WNYC public radio released the first episode of Baldwin's new podcast Here's the Thing, a series of interviews with public figures including artists, policy-makers and performers. The first two episodes featured actor Michael Douglas and political consultant Ed Rollins.[37] Here's the Thing was developed for Alec Baldwin by Lu Olkowski, Trey Kay, Kathy Russo and Emily Botein.[38]
In 1990, Baldwin met his future wife, actress Kim Basinger, when they played lovers in the film The Marrying Man.[39] They married in 1993[40] and had a daughter, Ireland, in 1995.[41]
In summer 2011, Baldwin began dating Hilaria Thomas, a Spanish instructor with Yoga Vida in Manhattan.[44][45][46] Baldwin and Thomas moved from the Upper West Side to Greenwich Village that August.[47][48][49] The couple became engaged in April 2012[44] and married on June 30, 2012, at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral in New York City.[50] They have one daughter together, Carmen, who was born in August 2013. [51]
In October 1995, Baldwin allegedly assaulted a photographer for videotaping his wife, Kim Basinger, and their 3-day-old daughter. The couple were returning from the hospital and were confronted by the photographer outside their Los Angeles home. Whoopi Goldberg praised Baldwin for his actions during her opening monologue while hosting the 68th Academy Awards.[52][53]
In December 2011, Baldwin was on an American Airlines flight at Los Angeles airport, playing Words with Friends on his phone while waiting for takeoff. When instructed to put away the "electronic device" by the flight attendant, he reportedly became belligerent and was eventually removed from the plane. He later publicly apologized to the passengers who were delayed, but not to the airline or federal regulators.[54]
A 2012 commercial for Capital One credit cards, for which Baldwin is a spokesperson, makes humorous reference to the event: a Viking character from the ad series asks about the phone Baldwin is using, to which Baldwin facetiously replies that it is not to be used on the runway, ending with a chiding "No!" A commercial for Best Buy also humorously referenced the event: Words With Friends co-creators Paul Bettner and David Bettner are on a plane and are interrupted by a flight attendant looking down at them, clearing her throat and signaling them to put their phones away.
Baldwin also made a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update segment, posing as the captain of the plane from which he was removed.
In 2008, Baldwin and Mark Tabb published their book A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce, which chronicles Baldwin's seven-year battle to remain a part of his daughter's life.[55][56]
Baldwin contends that after their separation in December 2000, his former wife, Kim Basinger, endeavored to deny him access to his daughter by refusing to discuss parenting,[57] blocking visitation,[58] not providing telephone access,[59] not following court orders,[60] not dropping their daughter off for reasons of convenience,[61] and directly lobbying the child.[62] He contends that she spent over $1.5 million in the effort.[63] Baldwin called this parental alienation syndrome.[64]
Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case "opportunists", and has characterized Basinger's psychologists as part of the "divorce industry". He has faulted them more than Basinger, and writes, "In fact, I blame my ex-wife least of all for what has transpired. She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there. Nothing off the menu, ever."[65]
Baldwin wrote that he has spent over a million dollars,[66] has had to put time aside from his career,[67] has had to travel extensively,[68] and needed to find a house in California (he lived in New York),[69] so that he could stay in his daughter's life.[55]
Baldwin contended that after seven years of these issues, he hit a breaking point, and on April 11, 2007, left an angry voicemail message in response to another unanswered arranged call, in which Baldwin called his daughter a "rude, thoughtless little pig".[70] He contends that the tape was sold to TMZ which released the recording, despite laws against publishing media related to a minor without the permission of both parents.[71] Baldwin admitted that he made a mistake, but asked not to be judged as a parent based on a bad moment.[72] He later admitted to Playboy in June 2009 that he contemplated suicide over the voicemail that leaked to the public. Of the incident he said, "I spoke to a lot of professionals, who helped me. If I committed suicide, [ex-wife Kim Basinger's side] would have considered that a victory. Destroying me was their avowed goal."[73]
During the autumn of 2008, Baldwin toured in support of the book, speaking about his experiences related in it.[74][75][76][77]
On May 12, 2010, he gave a commencement address at New York University and was awarded a Doctor of Fine Arts degree, honoris causa.[78]
On April 8, 2012, a 40-year-old French-Canadian actress, Genevieve Sabourin, was arrested outside Baldwin and his wife's Greenwich Village apartment house and charged with aggravated harassment and stalking. She was released without bail and told not to contact Baldwin. Prosecutors said she and Baldwin had met on a film set more than 10 years earlier, and that beginning in 2011 she began sending him multiple unwanted emails and texts.[79]
In 2013, Manhattan prosecutors filed nearly two dozen harassment and stalking charges against her, saying she had continued her unwanted advances. On April 8, she rejected a plea bargain, and a trial date was set for May 13.[80] On November 8, at the end of a non-jury trial, Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Robert Mandelbaum found Sabourin, by then 41, guilty on all counts and sentenced her to 180 days in jail for stalking, attempted aggravated harassment, and harassment, plus 30 days for attempted contempt of court.[81][82] She was released from New York City's Rikers Island jail on March 28, 2014.[83]
Baldwin serves on the board of People for the American Way. He is an animal rights activist and a strong supporter of PETA,[84][85] for which he has done work that includes narrating the video entitled Meet Your Meat.[86] His wife has joined the cause, fronting for PETA's Cruelty-Free Shopping Guide.[87] Baldwin also lent his support to the Save the Manatee Club by donating his time to record several public service announcements for the group, which had contacted him following his role in "Bonfire of the Manatees", an episode of The Simpsons in which he was the voice of a biologist working to save the endangered mammals.[88]
During his appearance on the comedy late night show Late Night with Conan O'Brien on December 12, 1998, eight days before President Bill Clinton was to be impeached, Baldwin said, "If we were in another country ... we would stone Henry Hyde to death and we would go to their homes and kill their wives and their children. We would kill their families, for what they're doing to this country."[89] Baldwin later apologized for the remarks, and the network explained that it was meant as a joke and promised not to re-run it.[90]
Baldwin said in a 2006 interview with The New York Times that if he did become involved in electoral politics, he would prefer to run for Governor of New York. When asked if he was qualified for the office, Baldwin responded that he considered himself more qualified than California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.[91] In June 2011, The Daily reported that Baldwin was mulling over a 2013 run for Mayor of New York City in the wake of a potential early race shake-up after candidate Congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal.[92] However, on December 21, 2011, Baldwin said he was abandoning plans to run for the office and would instead continue in his role on 30 Rock.[93]
In February 2009, Baldwin spoke out to encourage state leaders to renew New York's tax break for the film and television industry, stating that if the "tax breaks are not reinstated into the budget, film production in this town is going to collapse and television production is going to collapse and it's all going to go to California".[94]
During the 2011 Emmy Awards, Baldwin was slated to appear in a taped skit. However, the producers of the show cut a portion of the skit containing a reference to Rupert Murdoch and the News International phone hacking scandal. Baldwin told Access Hollywood Live that he asked them not to air his performance. Producers complied and he was replaced with Leonard Nimoy.[95]
Despite demonstrating strong political beliefs throughout his career, in October 2013 Baldwin announced that he would not donate money to political candidates while hosting his talk show Up Late with Alec Baldwin on MSNBC, in accordance with the company's policy.[96] On November 26, 2013, Baldwin's talk show was cancelled due to his alleged use of an offensive anti-gay epithet to describe a reporter, and for his alleged abuse of colleagues at NBC's headquarters.[2]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Raven-haired, suavely handsome and prolific actor Alec Baldwin was born on April 3, 1958 in Massapequa, New York, and is easily the best-known of the four Baldwin brothers in the acting business (the others are Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin and Daniel Baldwin). Alec burst onto the TV scene in the early 1980s with appearances on several series, including The Doctors (1963) and Knots Landing (1979), before scoring feature film roles in Forever, Lulu (1987), Beetlejuice (1988), Working Girl (1988), Married to the Mob (1988) and Talk Radio (1988). In 1990, Baldwin appeared in the first on-screen adaptation of the "Jack Ryan" character created by mega-selling espionage author, Tom Clancy. The film, The Hunt for Red October (1990), was a box office and critical success, with Baldwin appearing alongside icy Sean Connery. Unfortunately, Baldwin fell out with Paramount Studios over future scripts for "Jack Ryan", and subsequent Ryan roles went to Harrison Ford.Baldwin instead went to Broadway to perform "A Streetcar Named Desire", garnering a Tony nomination for his portrayal of "Stanley Kowalski" (he would reprise the role in a 1995 TV adaptation). Baldwin won over critics as a lowlife thief pursued by dogged cop Fred Ward in Miami Blues (1990), met his future wife Kim Basinger while filming the Neil Simon comedy, The Marrying Man (1991), starred in the film adaptation of the play, Prelude to a Kiss (1992) (in which he starred off-Broadway), and made an indelible ten-minute cameo as a hard-nosed real estate executive laying down the law in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He also made a similar tour-de-force monologue in the thriller, Malice (1993), as a doctor defending his practices, in which he stated, "Let me tell you something: I am God".Demand for Baldwin's talents in the 1990s saw more scripts swiftly come his way, and he starred alongside his then-wife, Kim Basinger, in a remake of the Steve McQueen action flick, The Getaway (1994), brought to life the famous comic strip character, The Shadow (1994), and starred as an assistant district attorney in the civil rights drama, Ghosts of Mississippi (1996). Baldwin's distinctive vocal talents then saw him voice US-aired episodes of the highly popular UK children's show, Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends (1984), plus later voice-only contributions to other animated/children's shows, including Clerks (2000), Cats & Dogs (2001), Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) and The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004).In the early 2000s, Baldwin and Basinger endured an acrimonious break-up that quickly became tabloid fodder but, while his divorce was high-profile, Baldwin excelled in a number of lower-profile supporting roles in a variety of films, including State and Main (2000), Pearl Harbor (2001), The Cooler (2003) (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor), The Aviator (2004), Along Came Polly (2004) and The Departed (2006). As he was excelling as a consummate character actor, Baldwin found a second career in television comedy. Already known for his comedic turns hosting Saturday Night Live (1975), he essayed an extended guest role on Will & Grace (1998) in 2005 before taking on what would arguably become his most famous role, that of network executive "Jack Donaghy", opposite Tina Fey in the highly-acclaimed sitcom, 30 Rock (2006). The role brought Baldwin two Emmy Awards, three Golden Globes, and an unprecedented six Screen Actors Guild Awards (not including cast wins).Continuing to appear in films as 30 Rock (2006) wrapped up its final season, Baldwin remarried in 2012 to Hilaria Baldwin (aka Hilaria Lynn Thomas), and is rumored to be considering political office.

      Has declined two roles that later went to Harrison Ford. First, he declined to reprise the role of Jack Ryan in Patriot Games (1992), then he turned down the lead role in The Fugitive (1993).
      Did a skit on Saturday Night Live (1975) in December of 2005 in which he spoofed himself delivering the same speech he did in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) to a couple of Santa's elves. Only some of the words were changed to apply to the elves rather than salesmen. He slipped though when saying the line, "Always Be Cobbling" instead he said the original line, "Always Be Closing". This made the other cast members break out in laughter on the live show.
      Caused a scandal by leaving an expletive-filled voice mail for his daughter, Ireland, calling her a "thoughtless little pig", which later was revealed to the media (11 April 2007).

      [1997] I'm starting to feel I have to cure my addiction to Hollywood money, because while it's delightful, it's also insidious.

      [on Tina Fey] Tina is smart, funny, beautiful... Devoted, tough, respected... Now if she'd only work on her posture.
      The comments of some Philippine government officials come as no surprise to me, either. Even the one by a former action film star-turned-Senator who beckoned me to come to the Philippines so he could 'beat' me over my comment. (in reference to Ramon "Bong" Revilla, Jr.)
      I have worshiped Meryl for so long that I would have played her driver or her chiropractor. (on Meryl Streep).
      Men are literally lying in bed with their wives when the marriage is essentially over thinking, 'I've got to get the hell out of here,' and have a fantasy woman in mind. Then you get divorced, meet a woman, marry her and, by the time all that goes by, you've aged a few years and are ready to go back to your ex-wife. You want a woman who is sane and normal. A woman who is more like you. You've gotten older.

      There are people who would rather choke than go see my movies. They write me letters all the time.
      I wanted to be president of the United States. I really did. The older I get the less preposterous the idea seems.
      [on Chris Farley] Whenever I was watching Chris perform I would think, 'How do I get where he's at? How do I get to be as funny and as honest and as warm?'
      You know, Hollywood does draw some very strange characters, and then the power of Hollywood and what they can do with it becomes like a blood sport to them.
      [on William Holden, the star he most admires] There's three things: there's masculinity, there's intelligence, there's sensitivity. You've got to bring those three things to a leading man's role. In some people there's a little too much in the mix of one or the other. With Holden it was always the perfect mix.
      I think I do want to go into politics. I really, really do. And I don't know if I will. You have to stop and ask a lot of whys. Run for the glory? Run to complete some missing piece of myself? I can keep doing what I'm doing for a living now and be perfectly happy.
      I just want to say: The worst cases you never hear about. Hollywood studios bury that stuff - actors who punch directors in the face and try to run producers over with cars - insanity, criminal behavior. But the studios are invested in that star, they can't have that person's name dirtied up.
      I'm at the age where, in the Tennessee Williams canon, all that's available is Shannon [in "The Night of the Iguana"]. After that it's Big Daddy.
      [on stage acting, as in "Orphans" on Broadway] Rehearsal is painful. Not knowing the lines, not having a mastery of the text is painful, because until you have it you can't play the scenes. When we're up onstage now I kind of dig it. It's fun. Though I know half the audience is going to like it for the wrong reason, half of them are not going to like it for the wrong reason. You just do the show.
      [after being arrested for cycling his bike the wrong way down Fifth Avenue] New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.

=======================================================
The handsome actor started out with a string of hit films and Kim Basinger at his side. A series of flops and one divorce later, the most famous Baldwin brother is fighting back.
Alec Baldwin’s full name is Alexander Rae Baldwin III. He is the second of six children, and was born into an Irish-American Catholic family in Massapequa, Long Island, New York.
Baldwin has three brothers, Daniel, Stephen and William, and two sisters, called Jane and Elizabeth. Baldwin and his brothers were all educated at Alfred G. Berner High School in Nassau County, and Baldwin graduated in the class of 1976. His younger brother Daniel both played football at High School under the tuition of the famous coach Bob Reifsnyder, who is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.
Although Baldwin’s background is usually described as Irish-American, he is actually of very mixed ancestry indeed. He has English, Irish and German forbears on his father’s side of the family, and French and Canadian ancestry on his mother’s side; his maternal grandmother came from Nova Scotia, and his paternal great-grandmother, Helen Irene McNamara was born in Ireland!
After graduating from high school, Baldwin enrolled at George Washington University in 1976, but then transferred to New York University to read for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Drama. He curtailed his studies, however, and didn’t actually return to complete his degree until 1994. Instead, he opted to study acting at the famous Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where his tutors were Elaine Aiken and Geoffrey Horne.
He also worked as a busboy at the famous New York night-spot, Studio 54, which gave him the opportunity to rub shoulders with celebrities of all stripes. Drama is clearly in the Baldwin blood, for all three of his brothers are also well-known actors. His brother Daniel has acted in 'Homicide: Life on the Street', his brother William had a role in the movie 'Backdraft', and brother Stephen has acted in 'The Usual Suspects'.
Since finishing his drama studies, Baldwin has pursued a multi-level acting career, and has divided his energies equally between screen acting for film and TV, and performing live on stage. His first major role on TV was as Billy Aldrich on the daytime soap called 'The Doctors', which aired from 1980 - 1982. Baldwin then appeared briefly in the short-lived series 'Cutter to Houston' before landing a major role in the new series, 'Knot’s Landing', which turned out to be his first really big break. In 'Knot’s Landing', he co-starred as the preacher son of Julie Harris. Baldwin then spent the next few years appearing widely on TV, before turning his attention to film acting in 1986. He made his big screen debut with a minor role in the feature film, 'She’s Having A Baby', which he swiftly followed with key roles in 'Beetle juice' (1987) and 'Working Girl' (1988). These two latter movies both both became high earners at the box office, which served to raise Baldwin’s profile considerably as the Eighties drew to a close.
Baldwin's next starring role was as Jack Ryan in 'The Hunt for Red October', which proved to a box-office blockbuster, grossing over $100 million! But sadly, he wasn’t invited to continue playing the role of Jack Ryan in the subsequent Tom Clancy movies, and his character’s role went to Harrison Ford instead.
But the 1990s were not without critical film success for Alec Baldwin. In 1991, he played a leading role in the ensemble movie 'Glengarry Glen Ross', alongside Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino, and was generally considered to have given the best performance in that highly challenging role. Also in 1991, he had a lead role in a movie called 'The Marrying Man', where he also happened to meet his future wife, Kim Basinger. The movie was lambasted by the critics, but since romance had blossomed, Baldwin was not phased by the harsh reviews! He appeared opposite Kim again (who had by now become his wife) in 1994 in a film called 'The Getaway', which was a remake the original movie that had been shot 22 years earlier. In 1993, Alec also played the part of Lamont Cranston AKA The Shadow in the movie of the same name.
Baldwin’s critical reception has fluctuated at times since the late 1990s, when his movies included several drama-packed thrillers, such as 'The Edge', and 'The Juror', where he starred opposite Demi Moore, as well as 'Heaven’s Prisoners'. Since 2000, he has tended to focus his career energies on playing character roles. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in the 2003 movie, 'The Cooler'. Since then he has also worked with Leonardo di Caprio in 'The Aviator' and in the gripping drama movie, 'The Departed', directed by Martin Scorsese. Like many other leading Hollywood actors, Baldwin has also played several key roles as a voice actor, including the films 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within' and 'Thomas The Tank Engine and Friends'.
Baldwin is famous for having hosted 'Saturday Night Live' no less than 15 times (as of 15 May 2010), and is allegedly one of only two people who have standing invitations to come and host the show whenever they like, the other person being fellow actor Christopher Walken!
Baldwin returned to the small screen in 2006 to star in the NBC sitcom '30 Rock', opposite Tina Fey, and his work on this production earned him several awards. Teaming up with Sarah Michelle Gellar, he starred in the romantic comedy 'Suburban Girl' (2007), which received mixed reviews. The same year saw the release of his film 'Brooklyn Rules'.
Sticking with comedy, Baldwin starred in 'My Best Friend's Girl' in 2008 and it was during this year that he was rewarded with a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor, an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his role in 30 Rock. He also returned as Makunga in the animated movie 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' and produced and starred in independent comedy entitled 'Lymelife' in the same year.
After starring alongside Cameron Diaz in 2009 drama 'My Sister’s Keeper', Alec went on to receive a BAFTA Award nomination for best supporting actor in 'It’s Complicated', which also featured Meryl Streep and Steve Martin. A box office success, the romantic comedy received generally mixed reviews and was nominated for a number of awards.
Although he did not appear in any 2010 feature film releases, Baldwin was in the spotlight as a co-host of the 82nd Academy Awards alongside Steve Martin. He then joined Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in 3D sci-fi action comedy 'Men in Black III', which was released in 2012.
Baldwin has punctuated his television and movie career with frequent stretches of acting on Broadway and the New York stage. In 1986, he made his Broadway debut playing in Joe Orton’s 'Loot', alongside Zoe Wanamaker, Joseph Maher and Charles Keating. In 1998, he starred in the title role of Macbeth at the public theatre, playing opposite Angela Bassett and Live Schreiber. Other Broadway productions that Baldwin has starred in include Caryl Churchill’s play 'Serious Money', with Kate Nelligan and an acclaimed production of Tennessee Williams’ 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. Baldwin’s stellar performance in this play, which also featured Jessica Lange and James Gandolfini and Aida Turturro, won him a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor. He also received an Emmy Award nomination for the television version of this play, which once again also starred Jessica Lange.
Although Baldwin has achieved considerable success with his acting both on the stage, and in movie and television, his personal life is frequently marked by scandal. He is often depicted in the tabloids as having a volatile temper and is noted for his fiery outbursts of anger. Whilst starring in an off-Broadway production of 'Entertaining Mr Sloane', his co-star Jan Maxwell allegedly quit the show early on account of Baldwin’s temper tantrums, which he later blamed on the high temperature in the theatre.
Baldwin's divorce proceedings with Kim Basinger have also attracted many column inches in the tabloids. His high-profile marriage to Kim came to an end in 2000, when the couple sought an official separation. Newspaper reports of the subsequent divorce proceedings featured allegations that Kim Basinger was physically and emotionally abused during the marriage - all of which are totally unproven. His attorneys issued several counter-claims, denying Basinger’s charges, and stating that she herself had a wide range of mental and psychological problems which remained to be treated, and also claimed that she was an alcoholic. In 2004, Baldwin was awarded ongoing custody of his daughter Ireland, as well as joint legal custody. Baldwin is on record as stating that he would like to re-marry and have more children, as the only time he feels truly happy is when he’s spending time with his daughter.
Baldwin also has a keen interest in politics, and is an active Socialist - so much so, that it has frequently been rumoured that he may one day run for public office. Baldwin has attracted a great deal of media attention on account of his strong criticisms of the Bush Administration, and was once publicly forced to recant a statement he had made saying that Dick Cheney was a terrorist! Baldwin has strong left-wing views, and serves on the Board of an organisation called People for the American Way. A reporter for the New York Times once asked Baldwin what would be his ideal office to run for, and he replied: 'If I ran for anything I would like to be Governor of New York.'

=======================================================
I would like to remember my father, Alexander Rae Baldwin, Jr. Born October 26th, 1927 in Brooklyn. NY. Died April 15th, 1983 after a battle with cancer.
A graduate of Boys High School in Brooklyn and Syracuse University, he served in the United States Marine Corps and was an expert marksman in riflery. He was honorably discharged for medical reasons after being shot, accidentally, during rifle instruction on Parris Island.
He returned to Syracuse University to attend law school, but dropped out and moved to Massapequa, Long Island, to begin his 28 year career as a public school teacher. 
My dad taught "social studies," as they were referred to back then. History, economics, constitutional law, contemporary problems. My father taught them all. He was a much admired teacher during those years. So much so that, twice, the editors of the school yearbook dedicated their editions to him, a tribute normally reserved for faculty that had either died or retired. He coached football at the school. Led a cub scout troop. Coached Little League. And was coach of the Massapequa High School rifle team, which went to the New York State Public High School Athletic Association state riflery championship twice during his career. That honor was nearly always the reserve of upstate, and therefore more rural, schools. For a "downstate" school to win was considered impossible.  My father's team won both times. 
Years later, doctors informed me that the inhalation of lead dust from working in an unventilated rifle range may have contributed significantly to his death. On Parris Island in 1945, a bullet would not kill him. But bullets eventually did, at the age of 55, from lymph cancer that spread through his body.  
As a father, he was tough and uncompromising. With six children, four of them boys, and little extra cash with which to spoil or bribe them, he implemented the "Fear Program." My brothers and I knew that any missteps of ours carried inevitable consequences. But he was more selfless and thoughtful than anyone I have known throughout my life. When my brother Daniel and I found out that local athletic champion Jimmy Luchsinger was teaching tennis at the nearby Marjorie Post Park, we sulked that we could never get the rackets we needed to participate. A day or two later, my dad came home from work and unwrapped two rackets, with the old wooden frames. He handed us the rackets and said, "If you miss one lesson, I'll be very upset with you."
As he did nearly every day I knew him, he switched on Huntley and Brinkley, lit his pipe and read the New York Times and Newsday, cover to cover. As he lay on the couch, I can remember the bottoms of his shoes with holes in them the size of half dollars. The man who would not resole his shoes had given us the rackets. That was my dad.
When he died, a part of me died as well. So many times in my life I could have used his advice. His wake at the local funeral home was mobbed with people. His funeral at our church in Amityville was overwhelming. In the intervening couple of years, I would ride the Long Island Rail Road and, on more than one occasion someone would say, "I had your dad as a teacher and he was a great man." Once in a while one would ask, "How is your dad?" and when I informed them that he had passed, some cried right there on the train. 
My own experiences with fatherhood have been...complicated. But I always remember the words of my dad. "Fatherhood is a race between two people," he would say, "where the man always wins the bronze."
For all the fathers out there, biological, step or adoptive; gay or straight; divorced, single or married; rich, poor, unemployed, overworked, good at the barbecue, cuts his own lawn, spoils his kids, wishes he could:  Happy Fathers Day. The one day you are awarded the gold.

'I am so lucky and blessed': Alec Baldwin coos over newborn daughter Carmen as he and wife Hilaria show off their tiny baby for the first time 
He is known for his often gruff persona. But it seems that Alec Baldwin is reduced to mush when it comes to his newborn daughter Carmen, who he and wife Hilaria welcomed into the world at the end of last month. The 54-year-old actor coos over the tiny tot as the couple show her off for the very first time during an interview on Extra TV on Wednesday. Scroll down for video   
So blessed: Alec Baldwin and his wife Hilaria show off their newborn baby girl Carmen during an interview with Extra TV on Wednesday 
 have her in his life.'I am so lucky and blessed, all those things everybody feels when you have a baby and you want to have that family,' he gushes. While Carmen currently has blue eyes like her father, Alec says he hopes that she ends up looking like his attractive yoga instructor wife.   
look like me,' he says. Meanwhile, Hilaria says that like most newborns, her daughter's looks are changing on a daily basis. 'She looks like herself… we’ll have to see, every single day, she changes so much,' she explains.   
What about me? But he also didn't forget to plant some on his wife tooThe 29-year-old brunette says she's relishing in motherhood and can't stop staring at her little girl.'Honestly, it’s a dream come true. Every single day I have trouble sleeping because I just want to look at her, and every single day you wake up and it’s Christmas,' she gushes. 'It’s a love that hurts. I want to make sure she’s okay, every single step of the way… it’s just absolutely indescribable.'  
What a pro: Alec, who also has a teenage daughter Ireland with his ex-wife Kim Basinger, was seen cradling Carmen through most of the interview 
 feeding habits. 'One of the things we’re, if you can hear me over this noise, is that the baby would eat through the dress. The baby would chew through the dress to get the goods,' he says with a laugh. The couple welcomed Carmen into the world on August 23 and couldn't wait to announce her arrival, taking to social media hub Twitter to share the happy news.   
Loving being a mom:  Hilaria says she's relishing in motherhood and can't stop staring at her little girl   
This woman courts publicity more than any wannabe I have seen in recent times and she claims she didn't know who Alec was and didn't marry him for fame. All her actions since her marriage have proofed otherwise.
It's all fun and games at 54, but before you know it, he'll be 64 and the baby only 10. He won't be so much fun when he's an old man and can't keep up with his kid!
'One of the things we¿re, if you can hear me over this noise, is that the baby would eat through the dress. The baby would chew through the dress to get the goods,' he says with a laugh
Cracks me up when a new parent acts like they're the first to every experience parenthood and love of a child!   ALL decent parents think the same thing about their babies, I'm sure even the cave people did!  Hilaria sure loves having the camera on herself, you can tell.  Imagine that's why she married Baldwin, fame; that and his money.  Sure wasn't for his temperment!
"umm...is it just me or does it appear that hilaria could use a lesson in holding a newborn? good god, woman!
- enwhyseer, east coast, United States, 4/9/2013 8:42"..Give her a break. It's probably the first time she's ever held the baby
Oh my, Mrs. Baldwin certainly looks smug in several pictures, as though she did something that others can't.  Poor, poor child.
