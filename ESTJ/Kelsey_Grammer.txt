Allen Kelsey Grammer (born February 21, 1955) is an American actor, voice actor, comedian, producer, director, writer and singer. Grammer is known for his two-decade portrayal of psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the NBC sitcoms Cheers and Frasier. He has won five Emmy Awards and three Golden Globes, and has also worked as a television producer, director, writer, and as a voice artist on The Simpsons as Sideshow Bob. Grammer has been married four times and has five children.
Grammer was born on February 21, 1955 in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, the son of Sally (née Cranmer; 1928–2008),[1][2] a singer, and Frank Allen Grammer, Jr. (1929–1968), a musician and owner of a coffee shop and a bar & grill called Greer's Place.[3][4][5] He had one younger sister, Karen Elisa Grammer (July 15, 1956 - July 1, 1975) who was less than two years younger than Kelsey.[6] Grammer was two years old when his parents divorced.[7] Grammer attended Pine Crest School, a private preparatory school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and later spent two years at the Juilliard School.[8] In 1968 Grammer met Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel heir Ben Novack, Jr. at the Pine Crest School, and they remained friends for forty years until Novack was murdered by his wife, Narcy Novack, as documented in The Prince of Paradise: The True Story of a Hotel Heir, His Seductive Wife, and a Ruthless Murder by John Glatt.[9]
Many of Grammer's family and close friends were killed in violent or accidental manners. In 1968, his father, whom he had seen only twice since his parents' divorce, was shot dead,[4] while in 1975, his younger sister, Karen, was abducted, raped, and murdered by spree killer Freddie Glenn.[10][11][12][13] In 1980, his twin half-brothers died in a scuba diving accident; and David Angell, close friend and producer of Frasier, died in the 9/11 attacks.[14][15]
After leaving Juilliard, he had a three-year internship with the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego in the late 1970s before a stint in 1980 at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He made his Broadway debut in 1981 as "Lennox", in Macbeth taking the lead role when Philip Anglim withdrew after receiving negative reviews. Grammer then played Michael Cassio in a Broadway revival of Othello, with James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer. In 1983 he performed on the demo of the Stephen Sondheim–James Lapine production Sunday in the Park with George, starring Mandy Patinkin. In 2000, Grammer again played Macbeth on Broadway.
On April 18, 2010, Grammer made his Broadway musical debut playing the role of Georges in a revival of the Jerry Herman/Harvey Fierstein musical La Cage aux Folles, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical.
His television career began in the early 1980s when he portrayed Stephen Smith in the NBC miniseries Kennedy.
Grammer came to broader public attention as Dr. Frasier Crane in the NBC sitcom Cheers. Grammer's former Juilliard classmate and Broadway co-star Patinkin suggested Grammer to the New York casting director, and he got what was supposed to be a six-episode job, but ended up as a regular cast member.[16]
The character became the center of the spin-off Frasier, one of the most successful spin-offs in TV history. In addition to starring, he also directed more than 30 episodes, especially during the second half of the series, and sang the closing theme "Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs." Frasier won and was nominated for many awards during its 11-year run.
In 2001, he negotiated a US$700,000-per-episode salary for Frasier. His 20-year run playing Dr. Frasier Crane ties a length set by James Arness in playing Marshal Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke from 1955 to 1975[17] and Richard Belzer in playing Det. John Munch on Homicide: Life on the Street and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit since 1993.
In 2005, Grammer returned to television. He produced and appeared in an American adaptation of the British show The Sketch Show, which aired on Fox. The main cast consisted of Malcolm Barrett, Kaitlin Olson, Mary Lynn Rajskub and Paul F. Tompkins, as well as Lee Mack from the British version of the show. Grammer appeared in only short opening and closing segments in each episode. Many of the sketches from the British version were re-created, such as the "California Dreamin'", "English Course", and "Sign Language" sketches. Only six episodes of the show were made, and it was canceled after only four of them had aired.
In 2007, Grammer starred with Patricia Heaton in the American sitcom Back to You. It was canceled by Fox after its first season.
His next attempt, ABC's Hank, fared even worse. It was canceled after only five episodes had aired. Grammer later commented, "Honestly, it just wasn't very funny."[18]
In 2011 and 2012, Grammer starred in the Starz drama series Boss as a fictional mayor of Chicago in the mold of Richard J. Daley which premiered in October 2011.[19] It is his first dramatic TV series.[20] At the 2012 Golden Globe Awards Kelsey Grammer won the award for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama for his role on Boss. The show ran for 18 episodes over two seasons.[21]
In May 2013, it was announced that Grammer would play a villain in the Paramount's Transformers movies fourth installment Transformers: Age of Extinction starring Mark Wahlberg.[22] Grammer and comedian and actor Martin Lawrence are considering pairing up to star in the upcoming comedy Partners for Lionsgate TV. The Lionsgate-produced show will be written and executive produced by Robert L. Boyett and Robert Horn, known for writing hit shows like, Family Matters, Living Single, Full House, Designing Women, and Perfect Strangers.
In addition to being producer, he guest-starred as the Angel of Death on Medium, and Captain Morgan Bateson in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "Cause and Effect".
Grammer's well-known voice and Mid-Atlantic accent make him popular for voiceover work. He has provided the voice of Sideshow Bob on The Simpsons, winning an Emmy Award for his work in the episode "The Italian Bob", his fifth Emmy win.[23] He has appeared in thirteen episodes since the show's inception in 1989, the most recent being "At Long Last Leave" that aired in February 2012, in which his character makes a cameo speaking appearance. Grammer supplied the voices for "Stinky Pete the Prospector" in 1999 Disney/Pixar film Toy Story 2, Vladimir in the Fox animated movie Anastasia, Rothbart in Barbie of Swan Lake, Zozi the Bear in the subsequently produced sequel Bartok the Magnificent, and the title character in the short-lived animated series Gary the Rat. He provided the opening speech and piano in The Vandals' song "Phone Machine" from the album Fear of a Punk Planet, and sang a rewritten version of the "grinch" on an episode of Just Shoot Me!. He was the voice of the mad scientist, Dr. Frankenollie, in the Mickey Mouse short Runaway Brain. He was also the narrator of "Mickey Mouse – Once Upon a Christmas".
Grammer's voice has been featured in many commercials. One of the earliest was a 1998 commercial for Honey Nut Cheerios, where he played the voice of the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood. Since 2006, Grammer has provided the voice for television commercials advertising Hyundai. In 2008, Grammer reprised his role of Dr. Frasier Crane in a commercial for Dr Pepper.
His production company, Grammnet Productions, produces the CW sitcoms Girlfriends and The Game (now on BET), the NBC drama Medium, and many other projects.
In 1996, he starred in the feature comedy Down Periscope. Also, in the 1990s, he did several commercials for Snapper Mowers. Additionally his film work includes the role of Dr. Hank McCoy (also known as the Beast) in X-Men: The Last Stand, and he was the voice of Snowball in the live-action film adaptation of the George Orwell book Animal Farm. Grammer co-starred in the movie Swing Vote, playing the Republican incumbent. He played General George S. Patton in An American Carol. In 2010, he starred in The Kelsey Grammer Bill Zucker Comedy Hour.[24]
Grammer has been married four times and has five children and one grandchild as of 2012[update].[25] His first marriage, to dance instructor Doreen Alderman,[26] lasted from 1982 to 1990, although they were separated for the last six years of that period.[27][28] They have one daughter, Spencer Grammer (born October 9, 1983),[29] an actress on the CBS Daytime soap opera As the World Turns and the ABC Family show Greek. Spencer's son, Emmett Emmanual Hesketh (born October 10, 2011), is Grammer's grandson.[26]
After his divorce from Alderman, Grammer had a daughter, Kandace Greer Grammer ("Greer Grammer"; born February 15, 1992), with hair and makeup stylist Barrie Buckner. Greer is currently a cast member on MTV's hit show Awkward..[30][31][32]
His second marriage, to former exotic dancer Leigh-Anne Csuhany in September 1992,[33] lasted one year. Grammer filed for an annulment when Csuhany was three months pregnant and evicted her from their home.[34] Grammer claimed that she was abusive and fired a gun at him.[4][35]
In 1994, he met 28-year-old Tammy Baliszewski, also known as Tammy Alexander, at a bar in Manhattan Beach, California. In December 1994, the two of them appeared on the cover of People magazine, announcing their engagement and Grammer's substance abuse problems.[36] They broke up in 1995.[citation needed]
In August 1997, Grammer married Camille Donatacci, a former Playboy model. They met on a blind date in 1996.[37] They have a daughter, Mason Olivia (born October 24, 2001), and a son, Jude Gordon (born August 28, 2004), both born to a surrogate mother.[31] During their marriage, several of Grammer and Donatacci's homes were featured in magazines, including ones in: Malibu, California (February 2001, InStyle), Maui (May 2004, InStyle), Long Island, New York (April 2008, InStyle), Bachelor Gulch, Colorado (Architectural Digest),[38] and Bel Air, Los Angeles (Architectural Digest). It was announced on July 1, 2010, that Donatacci had filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[39] Grammer and Donatacci's divorce was finalized on February 10, 2011.[40]
On August 12, 2010, Grammer announced that he was going to be a father for the fifth time with girlfriend Kayte Walsh, a British flight attendant who is 25 years his junior.[41] However, in October, Grammer announced that Walsh had miscarried six weeks earlier.[42] The couple announced their engagement in December 2010.[43] At the beginning of February, Grammer and Walsh booked the ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for their wedding, at a cost of more than $100,000 for the reception, despite rumors of Grammer's divorce not being finalized.[44] The couple wed there on February 25, 2011, two weeks after the finalization of his third divorce.[45] In January 2012, Grammer announced that he and Walsh were expecting twins.[46] On July 13, 2012, Walsh gave birth to a daughter, Faith Evangeline Elisa. Faith's expected twin, a boy, died in utero.[47] In March 2014, it was announced that they are expecting their second child together, which will be the sixth for Grammer.[48]
Shortly after Grammer left Julliard, his younger sister Karen was abducted, raped, and murdered by Freddie Glenn. Her murderer was up for parole in June of 2009. In a letter to the parole board upon Glenn's hearing, Grammer (who was unable to attend the hearing as planned due to inclement weather delaying his flight) wrote:
She was my best friend and the best person I knew. . . . I loved my sister, Karen. I miss her. I miss her in my bones. I was her big brother. I was supposed to protect her--I could not. I have never gotten over it. . . . It very nearly destroyed me. [49]
In 1998, Grammer filed a lawsuit against Internet Entertainment Group, which Grammer claimed had stolen from his home a videotape of him having sex with a woman. IEG countersued Grammer, denying they were in possession of such a tape, and Grammer's suit was eventually dropped.[50] IEG President Seth Warshavsky told the New York Post, "We have been presented with another Kelsey Grammer tape. But we have no plans to air it. We are still evaluating it at this time."[51] Grammer later told Maxim, "Whether or not you're a celebrity—even if you're just an old slob with a video camera—you don't realize you shouldn't do it. So you throw the tape in the back of a dark closet until your old girlfriend remembers it's there because you're famous now and she's not. But if you're not prepared to do the time, don't do the crime."[52]
Grammer allegedly began drinking alcohol at the age of nine;[53] although he denies this in his autobiography, he did become a frequent abuser of alcohol. In 1988, Grammer was arrested for drunk driving and cocaine possession and sentenced to 30 days in jail.[54] In August 1990, Grammer was arrested again for cocaine possession and was sentenced to three years' probation, fined $500, and required to perform 300 hours of community service.[54] In January 1991, Grammer was given an additional two years' probation for violating his original probation through additional cocaine use.[54] The cast and producers of both Frasier and Cheers held interventions to attempt to help him. Grammer's personal problems affected his work; costar Bebe Neuwirth and writer Ken Levine cited delays with rehearsals and filming due to his erratic behavior.[citation needed] Writer Dan O'Shannon recalled, however, that[55]
He would ooze into the studio, his life all out of sorts. Jimmy would say "Action," and he would snap into Frasier and expound in this very erudite dialogue and be pitch-perfect. And Jimmy would yell "Cut!" and he would ooze back into Kelsey—glazed-over eyes, half asleep, going through whatever he was going through. It was the most amazing transformation I'd ever seen.[55]
In 1995, Grammer was sued by ex-girlfriend Cerlette Lamme for defamation of character and invasion of privacy over content he included in his autobiography So Far.[56] In September 1996, he crashed his Dodge Viper while intoxicated, and subsequently checked into the Betty Ford Center (an alcohol rehabilitation clinic) for 30 days.[54]
In August 2008, Bradley Blakeman, a former aide to George W. Bush, filed a copyright lawsuit in federal court on Long Island over Grammer's movie Swing Vote, claiming that parts of its plot and marketing had been stolen from him. The lawsuit claimed that Blakeman had given a copyrighted screenplay called Go November to Grammer in 2006, and that Grammer agreed to develop the project and star as a Republican president but instead ended up playing a similar role in Swing Vote, which was released on August 1, 2008. Grammer's spokesman dismissed the claims as "frivolous" and a "waste of time". The lawsuit claims that Blakeman's copyrighted screenplay had the same basic plot as Swing Vote.[57]
On May 31, 2008, while paddleboarding with his then-wife Camille in Hawaii, Grammer experienced symptoms of a heart attack. After being hospitalized, it was confirmed that he had experienced a heart attack.[58] He was released on June 4, 2008, and was said to be "resting comfortably" at his Hawaiian residence.[59][dead link] Seven weeks after the attack, Grammer told Entertainment Tonight that, although at the time his spokesman described the attack as mild, it was in fact more severe, almost leading to his death, as his heart had stopped.[60] Grammer thought Fox's decision to cancel his TV sitcom Back to You contributed to his health problems, stating that "It was a very stressful time for me, and a surprise that it was cancelled. But you know, everything that doesn't kill us—which it almost did—makes us stronger!".[61]
On June 28, 2008, Grammer checked into an undisclosed Manhattan hospital after complaints of feeling faint. Other reports said Grammer was hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat.[62] His publicist said that it may have been due to a reaction to medication.[63][64]
Grammer is a member of the Republican Party and has expressed an interest in someday running for United States Congress.[65] He is also interested in running for Mayor of New York.[66] Grammer was a guest at President George W. Bush's first inauguration.[67] Grammer endorsed Rudy Giuliani in the 2008 presidential primary and later campaigned for John McCain in the general election.[68][69] Grammer promotes RightNetwork, a conservative start-up American television network.[70] He endorsed Michele Bachmann for the Republican nomination for president in 2012.[71]
He won a number of Emmys, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Golden Globes for his work on Frasier. He was the first American actor ever to be nominated for multiple Emmy awards for portraying the same character on three different television shows (Cheers, Frasier, and Wings).
Grammer has received at least 45 nominations for major awards and has won on 18 occasions.[72] He has received 14 individual Emmy Award nominations for 4 different television shows (plus an additional 2 as part of the Frasier ensemble) and has won on 5 occasions. At the Golden Globes, he has received nine nominations and thrice been victorious. He has received two People's Choice Awards, and in 1999 his directorial skills were recognized with a nomination for a Directors Guild of America award for directing an episode of Frasier. He received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role in X-Men: The Last Stand. On May 22, 2001, he was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television. On April 20, 2009, Grammer was presented the inaugural Television chairman's Award at the annual NAB Show in Las Vegas.[73] In 2010, Grammer enjoyed his first Tony Award nomination for La Cage Aux Folles as Best Leading Actor in a Musical.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          A five-time Emmy Award winner, Kelsey Grammer is the first actor in television history to receive multiple Emmy nominations for performing the same role on three series. He received two nominations for his original portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane on Cheers (1982), another for his guest appearance in that role on Wings (1990), and nine nominations (earning four awards) as Outstanding Actor for his work on Frasier (1993). Over the years, Dr. Frasier Crane has become one of television's most endearing and enduring characters. In addition to his Emmy Awards, Grammer has won two Golden Globe Awards, two American Comedy Awards and a People's Choice Award for his portrait. Grammer's distinctive voice has been heard in several hit animated features, including the voice of Stinky Pete in Disney's hit Toy Story 2 (1999) and a role in Anastasia (1997). On television, he has also been seen in several mini-series and movies. In 1996, he hosted an hour-long salute to Jack Benny for which he served as executive producer. He also starred in HBO's award-winning comedy The Pentagon Wars (1998).Born on February 21, 1955 in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, Grammer was raised by his mother and grandfather in New Jersey and then Florida. After his grandfather's death, Grammer was drawn to the works of William Shakespeare and spent two years at the prestigious Juilliard School. He then dove into the world of regional theater, eventually making the leap to Broadway with roles in "Macbeth" and "Othello". He joined the cast of the situation comedy Cheers (1982) in 1984. His autobiography, "So Far", was published in fall 1995.
      Has filed a lawsuit against Hamptons real estate broker Bettie Wysor of Dunemere Real Estate who put him and his wife next door to a construction site. The couple rented a mansion next door to advertising executive Jay Chiat in summer 1998. Kelsey was uninformed of Chiat's extensive renovation, and is suing Wyson for $100,000 for failing to warn him but Wysor says that work on Chiat's house was finished by the time the Grammers moved in. She claims the couple only used their place for three of the four weeks they had rented it for, and never complained to her about anything. [May 2000]
      His father was murdered in the Virgin Islands. His sister was murdered while finishing a shift working at a Red Lobster in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Had two stepbrothers (from his father's second marriage) that were killed in a shark/scuba accident.
      Signed a new second season deal for Frasier (1993). He will be getting about £1.1 million per episode. This makes him the highest paid television star ever.

      Wife Camille Grammer appeared on his situation comedy Frasier (1993), in the episode Frasier: Halloween (1997).
      He filed suit against his former talent agency, Artists Agency, in order to recover $1.8 million in commissions. The current lawsuit comes on the heels of a Screen Actors Guild arbitration that has ordered him to pay the agency commissions withheld since 1998. Artists Agency is claiming that it has a right to claim ongoing profit participation in Frasier (1993), which means several million dollars in commissions with the series in syndication. He is charging that Artists Agency, which has represented him since the 1980s, didn't win him the role of Frasier Crane on either Cheers (1982) or Frasier (1993). In 1996, he switched agencies but continued to pay commission up to 1998, after which Artists Agency began arbitration. The arbitrator's ruling, which was handed down August 4, 2000, upholds a renewal agreement he says he was forced into signing and orders him to pay withheld commissions. [August 2000]

      Received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on May 22, 2001.
      I lost a lot of stuff when Karen died. It took about a year to get back to even thinking that there might be a reason to go on.
      I got fired when I was a dishwasher at Denny's. That set me back a little bit. You don't realize how important dishwashers are until you do the job.
      [on his role as Tom Kane the brutal mayor of Chicago in Boss (2011)] He's an exciting character and a lot of fun to play. Iago is one of the most liked characters in Shakespeare's canon and he's the most evil, most extraordinarily manipulative person in history. He says the worst, most politically incorrect things, even for the time the play is set in - and yet audiences adore that character. There's some similarity there with Tom Kane. The discovery of this man has been a discovery of things I've never done or said before.
      Actors are observers of human life, of human behavior. If you've any smarts and any powers of observation, you kind of know what's going on inside a person like Tom Kane, and you just bring it out naturally. It's part of who you are. That's what you're good at.
      The cops in Chicago have told me that I have a withering look that is just like Mayor Daley's was. A lot of them come up and say, "Man, the way you do that thing, the way you turn that 'Fuck you' look on people, that is him.". I have not been a party to that look. I don't know it personally.
      [on the scripts for Boss (2011)] I think it's great writing, great writing. Why would you mess around with that? If something doesn't quite roll off the tongue or I'm having trouble memorizing it, that's often an indication that something is missing, That's always been my barometer. But this has been easy, a lot easier than it looks actually.
      [on if he was happy with the way Frasier (1993) ended] Oh yeah. Yeah, that was one instance where I knew the end of the show at the same time we did the first episode. My idea was always to embrace the idea that he's going off to the other world, using the poem of Ulysses. That was always part of it, and they were - happily - not against that idea.
      [on how challenging the makeup process was on X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)] It wasn't as bad as you'd think. We got the process down to an hour and a half for most of it, so it was only three hours total. So it wasn't brutal. It was just the prep. If I had to sit around in it for most of the day before we shot... well, that was just planning. That happened a couple of times, but I pissed and moaned enough to make sure it didn't happen more than once or twice. [laughs]
      [on playing Stinky Pete the Prospector in Toy Story 2 (1999)] Stinky Pete! What a poor, repressed little shit. [laughs] I loved him, but he was... I liked how small his thinking was. You know, how inside the box he wanted to be. He was a very interesting little character to play. The thing I remember most, though, was [co-writer/director] John Lasseter. His enthusiasm for the work he does was just breathtaking. He would run out of the sound booth and go, "Oh, my God, I can't wait to go animate that line!". He loves performance and embraces it. He likes to... well, he's just like a child. He's wonderful.
      [on playing Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons (1989)] An irrepressible villain. He is a presumptive joy to play on every occasion. Sam Simon had worked on Cheers, so that's how I got involved in that. He just called one day and said, "Hey, Kels, I remember you used to sing a lot on the set of Cheers. Can you do a Cole Porter tune?". I said, "Yeah, absolutely!". And that was the basis of the conversation. He said, "We've got this guy on the show, he's never said anything before, he's the sidekick character of Krusty the Clown," and once he ran it down, I said, "Sure, I'll play.". They were kind enough to send the song over first - you probably already know, but it was "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" - but I said, "Yeah, I can sing it.".
      [on if he has a favorite Sideshow Bob episode of The Simpsons (1989)] Well, I have a favorite Sideshow Bob line, which is [in character] "Lisa, you do not spend a decade as a homicidal maniac without learning a thing or two about dynamite.". [laughs] And then there's the rakes. That's just a classic.
      [on playing Dr. Frasier Crane in Cheers (1982) and his own spin-off, Frasier (1993)] The golden key. [laughs] When I first came onto Cheers, it was originally only going to be for seven shows. Apparently, I was funny enough to keep around. They said that to me quite openly. "He's funny enough to keep around. He makes things funny that we didn't think were funny, and that's an asset to the show." So they found a way to have him be part of it... You know, one of my favorite episodes of playing Frasier on Cheers was one I think was called "The Triangle", when he actually started to do therapy on Sam and Diane and sort of ended up examining himself in the process, and had the big blowout in Sam's office with the two of them. He sort of became his own man at that point, and I liked that. It was a good episode. And it was probably also when he realized he could have his own show. [laughs]
      [on if there was any hesitation to do Frasier (1993)] Oh, I quite clearly thought he should die with Cheers. But then we broke another story with Casey-Angell-Lee [writer-producers Peter Casey, David Angell and David Lee], and they wrote a great script about a completely different character. And it was [Paramount TV head] John Pike who was responsible for Frasier. He's the one who sat me down and said, "I think a sitcom should be funny, and the script you guys turned in is not." [laughs] "I want you to do Frasier.". So I said, "Okay, well, there's a couple of conditions: he's not married, and I don't want any kids in there.". So we found the devices to get as far away from Boston as we could, and people made an attempt to make sure this was a new guy with an old but recognizable name. But he was still the centerpiece of the show, so we got David [Hyde Pierce] to be the Frasier of the show, and we were able to let Frasier be someone a little bit different.
      [on playing Dr. Henry "Hank" McCoy/Beast in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)] The first thing that comes to my mind, honestly, is that we didn't do more. I'd love to play him again. He's such a great character. I'm glad they brought him in for that one, but it's a shame we didn't get to see more of Hank. Then they moved to the prequel and everybody got young. [laughs] But it's all right... I hadn't followed X-Men so much, but when I played the role, I got so much response from people about how excited they were. I think there was just a gap in the market. I think we missed a real chance there to give the ones who loved Hank a bit more of him.
=======================================================
Kelsey Grammer was christened Allen Kelsey Grammer. His father originally worked in the entertainment business, as he was a musician and owned a bar; Kelsey’s mother, Sally, was a homemaker.
Kelsey’s early life was marked by tragedy, when his father was shot and killed on the front lawn of his house in St. Thomas when Kelsey was just twelve-years-old. Sadly, the instigator of this crime was never convicted of murder, since his attorney pleaded diminished responsibility on the grounds of mental illness. Following the shooting, Kelsey and his mother left St. Thomas, and lived alternately between Florida and New Jersey, where Kelsey was raised partly by his grandparents. Media critics have sometimes conjectured that Kelsey turned to acting as a form of escape from the death of his father. Whatever the cause, he developed a love of Shakespeare from an early age, and soon distinguished himself on stage in a high school production of a play called The Little Foxes.
Kelsey’s teenage acting success inspired him to apply to the prestigious Juilliard academy in New York, as a prelude to pursuing his dream of becoming a professional actor, and happily, he was successful. After two years or so at Juilliard, however, Kelsey dropped out, and headed west to take a three-year internship at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. During his time at the Globe, Kelsey gained in-depth experience of acting in Shakespearean and classical dramas. According to a news report, Kelsey loves to tell the story of how he was “discovered” by a casting director. Kelsey says, “When I was 21, I was painting offices for a famous director. As I stood at the top of the ladder, the casting director of the San Diego Shakespeare Festival looked up at me and said, “You’re an actor, aren’t you? - I don’t know how he got this from my butt!” The director offered him the chance to audition - and the rest as they say is history.
After San Diego, Kelsey returned to the east coast to do a stint at the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, until finally, he realised his dream of acting on the Broadway stage in New York. He earned rave reviews for his portrayal of Lennox in Macbeth, and went on to take the lead role after the original actor stepped down. Kelsey’s other notable New York roles included Sunday In the Park with George, alongside Mandy Patinkin, followed by the role of Cassio in a Broadway revival of Othello, where his co-stars included Christopher Plummer and James Earl Jones.
Kelsey’s early acting successes were marred by a string of further family tragedies, however. In 1975, when Kelsey was 20, his sister Karen was abducted from outside a restaurant in Colorado, and then brutally raped and murdered. Five years later, in 1980, his two half-brothers were both tragically killed in a scuba diving accident.
Despite this spate of tragic losses, Kelsey’s career continued to gather momentum, and it wasn’t long before he started make his first appearances on TV. His TV career proper began in the early 1980s, when he took the role of Stephen Smith in a mini-series called Kennedy. He earned small, regular credits on soap operas such as One Life To Live, and also launched his voiceover career by providing the voice for the villainous character of Sideshow Bob on The Simpsons.
Kelsey would really begin to make his mark in the public eye when he was cast as Dr. Frasier Crane, in the hit TV series 'Cheers', which focused on a group of drinking colleagues in a downtown Boston bar. Rumour has it that Kelsey’s old buddy from Broadway days, Mandy Patinkin, put him forward for the job. Ironically, the character of Dr Crane was never intended to be included in the series long-term, but the viewing public loved it. So after Cheers came to an end, the producers created a spin-off series called 'Frasier', again starring Kelsey. The new storyline was based on the concept that Frasier had moved from Boston to Seattle, where he was now working as a radio psychiatrist. The show’s scripts revolved around the day-to-day routine of Frasier and his brother Niles, as well as Frasier’s dad Martin, a retired policeman who comes to live with Frasier, and Martin’s physical therapist-cum-housekeeper, Daphne Moon, an English beauty from Manchester, who keeps house for Frasier and his dad. Further complications were tossed into the pot via cameo roles for Frasier’s ex-wife, Lilith, and machiavellian agent, Bibi.
'Frasier' proved to be a major hit, although Kelsey himself could not have foreseen that the show would run for eleven years, and that he would, at one stage, become the highest-paid actor in American television. Almost overnight, 'Frasier' became one of the most successful TV shows in the history of American broadcasting, and made him a star worldwide. During its lengthy run, Kelsey’s portrayal of Frasier earned a total of four Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, as well as two Golden Globe awards for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV series.
In addition to his TV work, Kelsey found time to pursue movie acting. He made his film debut in 1992 in a movie called 'Galaxies Are Colliding', and won his first starring role in 1996, in 'Down Periscope'. The critics panned the latter, but Kelsey has won widespread acclaim for his voiceover work, which he’s pursued in tandem with his television acting career. He took character voiceover roles in 'Anastasia', 'Toy Story 2' and 'Animal Farm', as well as perennial appearances in 'The Simpsons'.
Behind the scenes, however, Kelsey’s personal life did not run quite as smoothly as his career. During the 1980s and 1990s, he fought an ongoing battle with alcohol and substance abuse, and was arrested in 1988 for drunken driving and possession of cocaine. In 1990, he was re-arrested and sentenced to 30 days in jail. Despite his close encounters with the law, Kelsey had clearly still not conquered his problem, for he was involved in an alcohol-related car accident in 1996, where he actually flipped over his sports car. Miraculously, Kelsey escaped serious injury but was sufficiently shaken by the incident to become a voluntary patient at the Betty Ford Centre, where he was treated for alcoholism and substance abuse.
Kelsey’s love life has also had its share of scandals, tragedies and dramas. He has been married four times to date; he was married to dance instructor Doreen Aldermann between 1982 and 1990, and has a daughter called Spencer from that marriage. Next, in 1992, he married stripper Leigh-Anne Csuhany, and this second marriage lasted a year. Kelsey has claimed that during the marriage, Ms Csuhany was abusive, and that after they began discussing the possibility of divorce, she attempted suicide. Happily, she survived the suicide attempt, but tragically, suffered a miscarriage. Also in 1992, Kelsey had a daughter, Greer, as a result of a relationship with hair and makeup artist Barrie Buckner. After publishing his autobiography “So Far..” in 1995, Kelsey was sued by a former girlfriend, Cerlette Lamme, for “defamation of character and invasion of privacy.” These accusations culminated in a costly lawsuit.
Kelsey then married former model Camille Donatacci in August 1997. The couple had a son called Jude Gordon, and a daughter called Mason Olivia. Kelsey and Camille divide their time between their homes in Malibu, California, Colorado and New York. Unfortuantely they divorced in 2011.
The last series of 'Frasier' was aired in 2004, but Kelsey has since returned to TV on Fox’s 'The Sketch Show'. He has also diversified his professional interests by producing two sitcoms, namely 'Girlfriends' and 'The Game'. He has also been a guest star on 'Medium', which is a show that he also produces. 
Alongside his TV work, he has also starred in the movies 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006) and its sequel 'X-Men: Days Of Future Past' (2013). He also appeared in 'Transformers: Age Of Extinction' (2014) and 'The Expendables 3' (2014).
Right, so: now that we’ve convinced you Lifetime is a thing you need to have in your life – what now? How do you get this on your telly? Here’s what you have to do.

=======================================================
							There is an inexorable link between comedy and tragedy  as Kelsey Grammer knows only too well. The star of US hit sitcom Frasier has overcome no end of hurdles in his private life to become one of television"s best-loved characters  and highest earners  over the past decade. Today, he has three Emmy awards to show for his portrayal of the radio psychologist in sore need of some therapy. 
						Born Allen Kelsey Grammer in St Thomas, the Virgin Islands, on February 21, 1955, Kelsey moved to New Jersey with his mother when he was two years old, after his parents divorced. They later relocated to Florida in 1967. His early years were unremarkable, but when Kelsey was just 13, the first of a series of tragic family events took place when his father was fatally shot by an intruder in his Caribbean home.
While at school in Florida, Kelsey got into acting in a big way. After graduating from high school the talented young student was accepted in 1973 into the theatre programme of the Big Apple's prestigious Juilliard School. But after a brace of years at the institution, Kelsey was expelled for what he later described as a lack of discipline. 
It was at about this time that Kelsey's life began to unravel around him. In June 1975, his younger sister, whom he adored, was raped and fatally stabbed. Five years later, his two young half-brothers died together in a freak scuba-diving accident. It would have been enough to send anyone over the edge.
Kelsey had discovered alcohol at the age of nine and was a frequent drinker by the time he was a teenager. Towards the end of the Eighties, his drug and alcohol abuse led to near meltdown. In 1987, following his first stint in a rehab clinic, the actor, by then a well-known face after landing the role of Doctor Frasier Crane in 1984 on the sitcom Cheers, was arrested for drink-driving. A year later, he spent 11 days in prison for cocaine possession.
Almost a decade later he crashed his car while under the influence. It was the wake-up call he needed: the actor checked into the Betty Ford Clinic. "I was at a point in my life where I just wasn't focused. Sometimes I was doing drugs, sometimes it was booze. There was no question that I shouldn't have been driving that car at that moment."
By this time, his Cheers character had moved to Seattle to become a radio psychiatrist on the sitcom Frasier. It was one of the most successful comedy series ever  the show has won 31 Emmy awards since its inception in 1993, and Kelsey became one of the highest-paid US TV actor, pocketing an unprecedented $1.6 million per episode from the start of the 2001 season. Frasier left the building for the last time in May, 2004.
Although his cinematic career has not sparkled as much as his small screen involvement, there are signs that Kelsey's forays onto the silver screen could soon hit paydirt. His mellifluous tones have graced such hits as Toy Story and Animal Farm,  and in 2001 he starred alongside Robert De Niro in 15 Minutes, playing a slimy tabloid TV presenter.
And finally, after some tempestuous times, Kelsey's personal life seems to have entered a halcyon period. He married his third wife, Camille Donatacci, a former Playboy model in 1997, and the couple have a daughter Mason Olivia, born to a surrogate mother. He has two other daughters, Spencer (born in 1985) and Greer (1992), from previous relationships.

Everyone who has ever watched television, probably knows of the series Cheers, and of its successful spin-off, Frasier, where the Emmy Award-winning actor Kelsey Grammer played the role of psychiatrist Frasier Crane. What may not be so well-known to the public is more about the star's personal life. In a story that is provocative, heartwarming and hysterical, Kelsey Grammer finally sets the record straight on his often painful yet always uplifting life. Behind-the-scenes stories from his professional life makes Kelsey Grammer's personal story both highly entertaining and supremely insightful.I must say that I knew little of Kelsey Grammer's life before I read his autobiography. I knew only of his substance abuse, and was vaguely aware of some of the loss he experienced. I had absolutely no idea that Kelsey Grammer had actually experienced such overwhelming tragedy in life.Anyway, I found this book to be very well-written - very engaging, enlightening and humorous. I was quickly immersed in the author's story because of his easy writing style. I give this book an A+!(less)
okay, i admit it. one night at work i had no reading materials and this book was there. i read it cover to cover in under two hours. i laughed out loud. this book was hysterical. surely not in the way mr. grammer intended it to be. i don't recommend it, per se.  but it has some great one-liners that reveal the twisted psychology behind the man. enjoy!
Once when locked in a room and trapped under something heavy, I read this entire book.  Actually I wish that were my excuse.  Read this only if you find yourself in the situation mentioned above, or if you need reasons to detest Kelsey Grammer.  Ruined Frasier for me!  Plum ruined.  
I picked this book up for a dollar at Goodwill, excited to get some insight to an actor who I thought must surely be brilliant. Sadly, I didn't really get any. Grammer has certainly had many experiences that would provide for a very interesting (if quite sad) memoir, but they're glossed over so quickly that it's about as emotional as reading a Wikipedia article on his life.

Grammer has certainly had many experiences that would provide for a very interesting (if quite sad) memoir, but they're glossed over so quickly that it's about as emotional as reading a Wikipedia article on his life. He does stop to mention personal pain, but it feels so very distant that there are few moments where the reader feels truly engaged. He tells you about his pain rather than making you feel it.By definition, memoirs are a bit self-indulgent for the author. While some are honest and sincere to the point where "self-indulgent" never so much as crosses your mind, others fall quite short of that. This book is the latter, unfortunately. The book seemed arrogant and self-indulgent, while at the same time as if Grammer's heart wasn't truly into writing it. Perhaps he would have benefited from waiting another decade or two before telling his story.The book was not difficult or painful for its flaws, in fact I read through it quite quickly, if only because I was hoping it was going to truly get interesting. If you find yourself particular curious, by all means, pick up a copy and go through it. It's not so terrible that you'll truly regret the decision to do so, but rather you will likely just feel a bit disappointed. Frasier might be less funny, once you see how uncomically true to character Grammer really is.(less)
I'm not sure I completely trust one aspect of Kelsey Grammer's autobiography, "So Far." Grammer blames every divorce on the wife, he takes no responsibility for his failed marriages. He approaches them as if he was a victim of a crazy woman and he had the sensibility to call it quits... but the complete absence of any remorse or responsibility is what gives me some pause, but also the way he talks of women is one of forced respect.

I'm not sure I completely trust one aspect of Kelsey Grammer's autobiography, "So Far." Grammer blames every divorce on the wife, he takes no responsibility for his failed marriages. He approaches them as if he was a victim of a crazy woman and he had the sensibility to call it quits... but the complete absence of any remorse or responsibility is what gives me some pause, but also the way he talks of women is one of forced respect. He loves a beautiful woman, a dancer, appearances, but never speaks of his love interests with actual love, or even respect. I think Kelsey Grammer has had a very rough life, one with great loss, and is a very good actor who has steller ideals when it comes to acting, being authentic, telling the truth, but his approach to women rubs me the wrong way. He objectifies women, not just in thought but words, in emotion. Oh well, no one's perfect.Concerning Grammer sleeping with a 15 year old baby sitter? The autobiography implies something definitely happened, and the act whatever it was, was one of Grammer awakening the hurt child within, perhaps due to his sister's death, a part of himself that never grew up... but whether they did have sex or not, I guess we'll never know.But to say that is all he is, is a great disservice. Kelsey Grammer is also a very spiritual and struggling soul, who has had profound spiritual experiences, and sought a life of truth and authenticity, and in the face of great loss, was broken in some ways, I think meditation in his adult life, zen.. could help him... the way it did when he was younger. It is strange that he was so into meditation growing up, but never speaks of it again as an adult... got too busy, forgot about it perhaps.His sister, who he was so close to growing up, was raped and murdered when he was a kid, I think that alone shines a huge light on this man, how it broke him in ways, how it deepened him in others, how it made him real, capable of giving and receiving love. I listened to his entire autobiography in two sittings, I started it yesterday... it was worth listening to.(less)
Don't read this book if you want to like Kelsey Grammer afterwards. He is much like his famous character, Frasier. Pompous, selfish, a braggart who truly finds himself a gift to all. He spends most of the book gloating of himself and skims over the top of all the things that humanize him. The horrible loss of his sister, his grandparents, his life with his mother and father. If he had elaborated on his life stories rather than his celebrity ones, this book would've been brilliant.I think the key...more

I was never more than mildly interested in "Cheers" and as such I was only dimly aware of his Frazier character and don't think seen nary an episode of the later "Frazier" sitcom. Still, I saw such positive reviews of this autobiography, I thought I'd give it a try. I am glad I did, especially with this audiobook effectively read by the author. It's a great performance and a honest and revealing assessment of a life full of tragedy, hope, and triumph.
I'm a huge fan of Frasier, so it pains me to say this, as I think Kelsey Grammer is a great actor, but I was very disappointed by this book.  He has a great many things to say, but they are all barely glanced over, there is no depth to the stories he tells, instead it's more like he's just listing off the events of his life.  This probably could have been better as a longer, more detailed book, but as it is, it's not very enjoyable.
Not the kind of book I usually read, or have ever read, but I ended up with it in a stack of books I got at a thrift store while out-of-state.  It was interesting, though, to see the process of "making it" in such a competitive field.  It was sad, however, to see the tragedy that has struck the life of this fellow human being, and the pain and emptiness in many parts of his life.  (Language was rough a few times.)
eh...not the best thing i ever read, nor the worst...kind of boring, there was like maybe 1 or 2 chapters on "cheers"...not so much a biography...was mostly his retelling of what he learned in therapy and arrogance about his acting ability...kinda pointless, in my opinion. his therapist should get writing credit.
I read this in eighth grade.  The only reason I brought it home from the city library was because I thought it'd be a funny book to be seen reading.  I ended up really liking it.  Any book you read in Kelsey Grammer's voice (a.k.a. Sideshow Bob's voice) is a winner.  "GOOD LORD!"
First audiobook I ever listened to. It's not terrible, but nothing amazing either. I think I gave it a good rating mainly because anyone willing to expose their faults to the world like this deserves a pat on the back, even if only out of pity.
I enjoyed reading this book and learned a lot about the actor's early life. The TV show CHEERS that ran from 1982-1993 coincided with my early adult life, and I have memories of coming home from evening college classes to catch this show.
Always being a fan of fraiser, I grabbed this book to read about Kelsey's real life outside of acting, and was very surprised at the trauma he's suffered in his life.  This was a quick read that I just couldn't put down.
I don't know what possessed me to read this, but I did.  I found it in a thrift store and dove in.  It was a weird book.  Kelsey Grammer is an odd guy.  Still, it was compelling and enjoyable.  
Bought it as a joke for $0.25. Read it cover to cover on a road trip. Hilarious in its absurdity. That's why it gets high marks from me. Oh, Kelsey Grammer, was this supposed to be serious?
A good example of not allowing a rough childhood and adolescent years influence who you become as an adult. Perserverance and determination.
Not good. Very bad. No idea what possessed me to read it in the first place (in my defense, it was years ago; but the horror of it stays with me) 
Arrogant and pointless.  His character is more likeable and less annoying and that is saying something. Don't bother with this one.
i chose some strange audio books to listen to sometimes, because that's all there was at the library.

       Grammer tells the story of his life, a life filled with tragedy, heartbreak and triumph: the murder of his father and sister, addiction to drugs and alcohol and his Emmy Award-winning sitcom. The book is laced with behind-the-scenes tidbits from his hit shows. Grammer reads his story with his characteristic precise pronunciation and careful diction. His pacing is good as his voice skillfully conveys the emotion of each episode. The abridgment is smooth, but Grammer's rehab story seems to get short shrift.  P.B.J.  (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine

  This is a wryly told portrait of a man whose life has had its share of ups and downs.  With his father murdered when he was a very young boy,  and his beloved sister raped and murdered when he was a young man, the author's life tragedies are significant. Yet, so are his successes.This is a man who struggled to come to terms with the harsh blows dealt him in life. He is a man whose coping mechanism led him to abuse drugs and alcohol, addictions that, as a result of his celebrity status,  were to become public and a source of great mortification. Conversely, Kelsey Grammer was also to find great personal success in his life, as an Emmy Award winning star of two hit series, "Cheers", where he was part of the stellar ensemble, and "Frasier",  a spin-off of his character in "Cheers"  and one in which he is the star.Still,  this is a remarkably candid recounting of those events in his life that were painful, as well as of those that brought him joy. Told with intelligence and  wry humor, it is a touching  look at a flawed man who is coming to terms with who he is. While the author does give some details of his professional life, this is not a book about stardom. Rather, it is a book of one man's journey through life, thus far, and his odyssey of self-discovery and acceptance.I  highly recommended that one get the unabridged audio book, which is narrated by Kelsey Grammer himself. While it may be a little hammy from time to time, his narration lends a certain poignancy to his words. His humor also shines through some of the reading, as does his innate intelligence. Those who enjoy memoirs and biographies will certainly enjoy this book.
  I came across So Far at the library and I was not planning on checking it out.  But, once I started reading it, I could not put it down.Kelsey comes across as an average guy who has had many setbacks throughout his  life.  It was enjoyable to read about someone who accepted responsibility  for his life without spending all of his time trying to blame someone for  his problems.This book has made me appreciate Kelsey Grammer for being  an incredibly talented actor who has never been afraid to take risks for  his career.  Also, it is enjoyable to read about someone who lives life to  its fullest.So Far is a quick and easy read.  I wish more books were  like Grammer's autobiography.
  While this is not the most tightly woven book I have ever read, I always enjoy reading about the life journey and current thoughts of an actor.  I especially respect Kelsey Grammer's long run as Frasier Crane.Though this memoir, we learn of the details of Grammer's life and also his life philosophy.  We hear the truth behind the Hollywood gossip.  We also hear the heart behind the actor and the character we have come to know from our weekly "visits".This book and Grammer's work itself taught me a lot about the power of comedy, and how as an actor, comedy is not as easy as it looks... and yes, it is as significant as high drama.It can be read very quickly - as an actor as well I try to read as much as I can from other actors.  This is a book that can be shared and enjoyed by many.
Even though Kelsey wasn't born in New Jersey, he spent his early years not far from my hometown in Colonia section of Woodbridge, New Jersey with his mother, Sally, his beloved grandparents, and his beloved sister, Karen. His childhood was scarred by tragedy. His father was killed in the British Virgin Islands where he lived with his second wife and children. His twin-half brothers were killed in a water-ski-ing accident.After New Jersey, his family moved to Pompano Beach, Florida where he studied acting in high school and played football. He applied and was accepted to prestigious Juillard in New York City and went to study there for two years before he had to drop out. Then the worst tragedy of all, his beloved 20 year sister Karen was raped and murdered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I think this event was the most devastating of his life even now.But there is another Kelsey besides him being an actor, he became accomplished in San Diego at the Old Globe Theatre and went to Broadway again in New York City. Then his big break came with Cheers, he considers Shelley Long, his angel, who ended up a bigger star than she. Even though she wanted Diane with Sam, let's face it who didn't. He did become a supporting player in a top series before doing his own series on his own. Kelsey became a bigger television star and for 11 seasons, he played Dr. Frasier Crane.Apart from his career, there was his relationships with women. Kelsey's background with women hasn't been stellar. In fact, he bounces around looking for the perfect mate and has issues with drugs and alcohol as well. Oh well, genius is always marred by weaknesses. Kelsey has addictive personality and his trouble with women may stem from his relationship with his mother.Read more ›
  There are salvageable, funny stories here - along with an at times touching portrait of personal loss - but they serve primarily to knit together a series of tales of relationships gone bad, at the end of which seemingly everyone but the author learns what the common demoninator is in each of these dysfunctional romances: Mr. Grammer himself.  Astonishingly, the author ends with the upbeat pronouncement that, finally, this flashy blond bombshell is The True and Perfect Love Which Will Endure Forever.  Spoiler alert: she wasn't.  While his eagerness to believe in love against all odds might be endearing elsewhere, here it is just too steeped in the utter cluelessness, lack of insight and concern for others and arrogance that characterizes the entire book.
      I have read and re-read this book many times, I think because it has lessons that I need to remember.
      Don't read this book if you want to like Kelsey Grammer afterwards. He is much like his famous character, Frasier.
      Fans of "Cheers" and "Frasier" will enjoy this journey through the life oflead actor Kelsey Grammer.
      He dishes up all the dirt on his life and it is one of trgic loss and ultimate fame.I am glad he survived!

      I have never seen Cheers.  I came across Frasier once while watching TV and was instantly amazed with Kelsey Grammer.
