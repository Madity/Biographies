Adele Laurie Blue Adkins[3] MBE (born 5 May 1988) is an English singer-songwriter. Adele was offered a recording contract from XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace in 2006. The next year she received the Brit Awards "Critics' Choice" award and won the BBC Sound of 2008. Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It certified four times platinum in the UK, and double platinum in the US.[4][5] Her career in the US was boosted by a Saturday Night Live appearance in late 2008. At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, Adele received the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[6]
Adele released her second studio album, 21, in early 2011.[7][8] The album was well received critically and surpassed the success of her début,[9] earning the singer six Grammy Awards in 2012 including Album of the Year, equalling the record for most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night.[10] The album has also led to her receiving numerous other awards, including two Brit Awards and three American Music Awards. The album has been certified 16 times platinum in the UK;[4] in the US the album has held the top position longer than any other album since 1985, and is certified Diamond.[11][12][13] The album has sold over 28 million copies worldwide.[14]
The success of 21 earned Adele numerous mentions in the Guinness World Records. She is the first artist to sell more than 3 million copies of an album in a year in the UK.[15] With her two albums and the first two singles from 21, "Rolling in the Deep" and "Someone Like You", she became the first living artist to achieve the feat of having two top-five hits in both the UK Official Singles Chart and the Official Albums Chart simultaneously since The Beatles in 1964.[16] With her third release from the album, "Set Fire to the Rain", which became her third number one single in the US, Adele became the first artist in history to lead the Billboard 200 concurrently with three Billboard Hot 100 number-ones.[17]
Adele is the first female in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 to have three singles in the top 10 at the same time as a lead artist, and the first female artist to have two albums in the top five of the Billboard 200 and two singles in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously.[18] 21 is the longest running number one album by a female solo artist on the UK and US Albums Chart.[19][20] In 2011 and 2012, Billboard named Adele Artist of the Year.[21][22] In 2012, Adele was listed at number five on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music,[23] and the American magazine Time named Adele one of the most influential people in the world.[24] In 2013, she received an Academy Award as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for her song "Skyfall", written for the twenty-third James Bond film of the same name.[25]
Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born in Tottenham, north London, England, to Penny Adkins, an English teenager, and Mark Evans, a Welshman, on 5 May 1988. Evans walked out when Adele was two, leaving her 20-year-old mother to raise her single-handedly,[26] for which Adele has still not forgiven him.[27][28] She began singing at age four and asserts that she became obsessed with voices.[29][30] Adele has cited the Spice Girls as a major influence in regard to her love and passion for music, stating that "they made me what I am today."[31] Adele impersonated the Spice Girls at dinner parties as a young girl.[32] To make her look like English R&B and urban contemporary singer Gabrielle, her mother made an eye patch with sequins, which Adele later said was embarrassing.[33] At the age of nine, Adele and her mother, a furniture-maker and adult learning activities organiser, relocated to Brighton.[34]
Two years later, she and her mother moved back to London; first to Brixton, and then to neighbouring district West Norwood, in south London.[35] West Norwood is the subject for Adele's first record, "Hometown Glory", written when she was 16.[36] After moving to south London, she became interested in R&B artists such as Aaliyah, Destiny's Child and Mary J. Blige.[37]
Adele says that one of the most defining moments in her life was when she watched Pink perform at Brixton Academy. "It was the Missundaztood record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live [...] I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible."[38][39]
Aged 14, Adele discovered Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald by accident as she stumbled on the artists' CDs in the jazz section of her local music store and was struck by their appearance on the album covers.[36] Adele states she "started listening to Etta James every night for an hour", and in the process was getting "to know my own voice."[36] Adele graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon in May 2006,[40] where she was a classmate of Leona Lewis and Jessie J.[3][41] Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent[42] even though at the time she was more interested in going into A&R and hoped to launch other people's careers.[3]
Four months after graduation, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com.[43] She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend[3] who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting.[41][44] Nick Huggett at XL recommended Adkins to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative.[45] September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major draw for Adele, a big fan of the British singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL in September 2006.[45] Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, "My Yvonne", for his debut album, and it was during this session she first met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album 19, and tracks on 21.[46] Adele's breakthrough song, "Hometown Glory", was released in October 2007.[45] Adele supported Will Young at the 2007 MENCAP Little Noise Sessions, a charity concert at London's Union Chapel.
In 2008 she was the headliner and performed an acoustic set and was supported by Damien Rice.[47][48] She became the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008.[49][50] 19, named for her age at the time she wrote many of its songs, entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music named 19 an "essential" blue-eyed soul recording.[51] She released her second single "Chasing Pavements" on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, 19. The song reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks.[52] Adele was nominated for a 2008 Mercury Prize award for 19.[53] She also won an Urban Music Award for "Best Jazz Act".[54] She also received a Q Awards nomination in the category of Breakthrough Act[55] and a Music of Black Origin nomination in the category of Best UK Female.[56] In March 2008, Adele signed a deal with Columbia Records and XL Recordings for her foray into the US.[57] She embarked on a short North American tour in the same month.[57] 19 was released in the US in June.[42] Billboard magazine stated; "Adele truly has potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation."[58] The An Evening with Adele world tour began in May 2008 and ended in June 2009.
She later cancelled the 2008 US tour dates to be with a former boyfriend. She said in Nylon magazine in June 2009, "I'm like, 'I can't believe I did that.' It seems so ungrateful.... I was drinking far too much and that was kind of the basis of my relationship with this boy. I couldn't bear to be without him, so I was like, 'Well, OK, I'll just cancel my stuff then'." By the middle of October 2008, it appeared that Adele's attempt to break into America had failed.[59][60] Then, she was the musical guest on 18 October 2008 episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live. The episode included an expected appearance by then US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The program earned its best ratings in 14 years with 17 million viewers. Adele performed "Chasing Pavements" and "Cold Shoulder",[61] and the following day, 19 topped the iTunes charts and ranked at number five at Amazon.com while "Chasing Pavements" rose into the top 25.[62] The album reached number 11 on the Billboard 200 as a result, a jump of 35 places over the previous week.[63] In November 2008 Adele moved to Notting Hill after leaving her mother's house, a move that prompted her to give up drinking.[64] The album was certified as gold in February 2009 by the Recording Industry Association of America.[65] By July 2009, the album had sold 2.2 million copies worldwide.[66]
In 2010, Adele received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Hometown Glory".[67] In April her song "My Same" entered the German Singles Chart after it had been performed by Lena Meyer-Landrut in the talent show contest Unser Star für Oslo (Our Star for Oslo), in which the German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was determined.[68][69] In late September, after being featured on The X Factor, Adele's version of Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love" re-entered the UK singles chart at number 4.[70] During the 2010 CMT Artists of the Year special, Adele performed a widely publicised duet of Lady Antebellum's "Need You Now" with Darius Rucker.[71] This performance was later nominated for a CMT Music Award.[72]
Adele released her second studio album, 21, on 24 January 2011 in the UK and 22 February in the US.[8][73] She said that the album was inspired by the breakup with her former partner.[27] The album's sound is described as classic and contemporary country and roots music. The change in sound from her first album was the result of her bus driver playing contemporary music from Nashville when she was touring the American South, and the title reflected the growth she had experienced in the prior two years.[73] Adele told Spin Magazine "It was really exciting for me because I never grew up around [that music]."[7] 21 hit number 1 in more than 26 countries, including the UK and the US.[74][75][76]
An emotional performance of "Someone like You" at the 2011 BRIT Awards on 15 February propelled the song to number one in the UK.[77] Her first album, 19, re-entered the UK album chart alongside 21, while first and second singles "Rolling in the Deep" and "Someone like You" were in the top 5 of the UK singles chart, making Adele the first living artist to achieve the feat of two top-five hits in both the Official Singles Chart and the Official Albums Chart simultaneously since the Beatles in 1964.[78] Both songs topped the charts in multiple markets and broke numerous sales performance records. Following her performance of "Someone like You" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, it became Adele's second number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100.[79] By December 2011, 21 sold over 3.4 million copies in the UK, and became the biggest-selling album of the 21st century, overtaking Amy Winehouse's Back to Black,[80][81] with Adele becoming the first artist ever to sell three million albums in the UK in one calendar year.[82][83] "Set Fire to the Rain" became Adele's third number one single on the Billboard Hot 100, as Adele became the first artist ever to have an album, 21, hold the number-one position on the Billboard 200 concurrently with three number one singles.[17]
To promote the album, Adele embarked upon the "Adele Live" tour, which sold out its North American leg.[84] In October 2011, Adele was forced to cancel two tours because of a vocal-cord haemorrhage. She released a statement saying she needed an extended period of rest in order to avoid permanent damage to her voice.[85] In the first week of November 2011 Steven M. Zeitels director of the Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston performed laser microsurgery on Adele's vocal cords to remove a benign polyp.[86][87][88] A recording of her tour, Live at the Royal Albert Hall was released in November 2011, debuting at number one in the US with 96,000 copies sold, the highest one-week tally for a music DVD in four years, becoming the best-selling music DVD of 2011.[89] Adele is the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history to have the year's number-one album (21), number-one single ("Rolling in the Deep"), and number-one music video.[90] At the 2011 American Music Awards on 20 November, Adele won three awards; Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Album for 21.[91] On 9 December, Billboard named Adele artist of the year, Billboard 200 Album of the year (21), and the Billboard Hot 100 Song of the year ("Rolling in the Deep"), becoming the first female ever to top all three categories.[21][92]
Following the throat microsurgery, she made her live comeback at the 2012 Grammy Awards in February.[93] She won in all six categories for which she was nominated, making her the second female artist after Beyoncé in Grammy history to win that many categories in a single night.[94] Following that success, 21 achieved the biggest weekly sales increase following a Grammy win since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking data in 1991.[95][96] Adele received the BRIT Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, and British Album of the Year.[97][98] Following the Brit Awards, 21 reached number 1 for the 21st non-consecutive week on the UK Album Chart.[99] The album has sold over 4.5 million copies in the UK where it is the fourth best-selling album of all time.[100] In October, the album passed the 4.5 million mark in the UK, and in November surpassed the 10 million mark in the US.[13][101][102] Adele is the only artist or band in the last decade in the US to earn an RIAA Diamond certification for a one disc album in less than two years.[101]
In October 2012, Adele confirmed that she had been writing and recording the theme song for Skyfall, the twenty-third James Bond film.[103][104] The song "Skyfall", co-written with producer Paul Epworth, was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and features orchestrations by J. A. C. Redford.[105][106] Adele stated recording "Skyfall" was "one of the proudest moments of my life." On 14 October, "Skyfall" rose to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart with sales of 92,000 copies bringing its overall sales to 176,000, and "Skyfall" entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 8, Adele's first song to debut in the Top 10, selling 261,000 copies in the United States in its first three days.[107] This tied "Skyfall" with Duran Duran's "A View to a Kill" as the highest-charting James Bond theme song on the UK Singles Chart.[108] "Skyfall" has sold more than two million copies worldwide[109] and earnt Adele the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song[110] and the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[111] In December 2012, Adele was named Billboard Artist of the Year, and 21 was named Album of the Year, making her the first artist to receive both accolades two years in a row.[22] Adele was also named top female artist.[22] The Associated Press named Adele Entertainer of the Year for 2012.[112] The 2013 Grammy Awards saw Adele's live version of "Set Fire to the Rain" win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance, bringing her total wins to nine.[113]
On 3 April 2012, Adele confirmed that her third album would likely be at least two years away, stating, "I have to take time and live a little bit. There were a good two years between my first and second albums, so it'll be the same this time." She stated that she would continue writing her own material.[114] At the 2013 Grammy Awards, she confirmed that she was in the very early stages of her third album and was having meetings while staying in Los Angeles for the Oscars, despite previously denying reports.[115][116] She also stated that she will most likely work with Paul Epworth again.[115] Others since reported to be working with Adele on her new album include Kid Harpoon, James Ford, Phil Collins, Ryan Tedder and Diane Warren.[117][118][119][120][121] Adele's publicist has confirmed that the album will be released in 2014.[122]
In September 2013, Wiz Khalifa confirmed that he and Adele had collaborated for his upcoming fifth studio album, Blacc Hollywood, although the collaboration has yet to be cleared for the album.[123] In January 2014, Adele received her tenth Grammy Award with "Skyfall" winning Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.[124] On the eve of her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a cryptic message via her Twitter account which prompted media discussion about her next album. The message, "Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year", was interpreted by outlets including the Daily Mail and Capital FM as meaning that her next album would be titled 25 and released later in the year.[125][126] Adele in 2014 also received 9 nomination for the World Music Awards.
It was reported in January 2012 that Adele was dating charity entrepreneur and Old Etonian Simon Konecki.[127] In June 2012, Adele announced that she and Konecki were expecting a baby.[128][129] Their son Angelo was born on 19 October 2012.[130] The child is the first for Adele and the second for Konecki, who also has a daughter with his ex-wife.[131]
Adele has been criticized by celebrities such as Karl Lagerfeld[132] and Joan Rivers[133] for her weight, but has gained the support of many others, by stating that she is happy with her weight and would only change if it affected her health or sex life.[134]
Politically, Adele is a supporter of the Labour Party, despite in May 2011 having reportedly expressed views on taxation counter to those of the party.[135][136] Born in Tottenham, she supports her hometown Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur.[137] In April 2013, it was reported Adele had an estimated £30 million ($47.9m) fortune, making her the wealthiest young British musician under 30 years of age.[1] In June 2013, Adele was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music, and she received the award from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace on 19 December 2013.[138][139]
Initially, critics suggested that her vocals were more developed and intriguing than her songwriting, a sentiment with which Adele agreed.[140] Adele has stated: "I taught myself how to sing by listening to Ella Fitzgerald for acrobatics and scales, Etta James for passion and Roberta Flack for control."[141] Adele's first album is of the soul genre, with lyrics describing heartbreak and relationship.[42] Her success occurred simultaneously with several other British female soul singers, with the British press dubbing her a new Amy Winehouse.[3] This was described as a third British Musical Invasion of the US.[41] However, Adele called the comparisons between her and other female soul singers lazy, noting "we're a gender, not a genre".[42][59][142] By the beginning of 2009, listeners and critics started to describe Adele as unique. AllMusic wrote that "Adele is simply too magical to compare her to anyone."[36] Following the release of her debut album 19, Kanye West and Beyoncé were among the artists vocal in their praise of her music.[42] Beyoncé cited Adele as one of the influences for her fourth album, 4.[143] Madonna expressed a desire to collaborate with Adele, commenting; "I think she’s brilliant, I love her".
When asked about how one composes soul music, singer Patti LaBelle explained: "I believe that you first of all have to have soul. You could be white, black - it doesn't matter - straight or gay. You can compose from your soul. And if it's your soul - like Adele - she's a beautiful big ole white woman, okay? Now, does she have that soul and she composes and she does it all."[144]
On "Don't You Remember", the song contains bluesy guitar riffs and instrumental backing from the banjo and the accordion, the Rick Rubin-produced song is one of the more potent examples of the country music influences that permeate the album.
One of the more pop-influenced songs on the album, the "epic" power ballad[145] "Set Fire to the Rain" situates Adele's mournful vocal ad-libs ("let it burn") around a swirling strings arrangement as she alternatively affirms and laments the end of her relationship.
Celine Dion performed "Rolling in the Deep" at her show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, after telling the crowd, "I love Adele so much. She's amazing."[146] J. J. Burnel of The Stranglers is also a fan, stating; "She had me riveted... Of course she's huge and normally that would turn me off because it's too commercial. But I was seriously impressed".[147] Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and Nirvana fame has repeatedly praised Adele in interviews.[148][149] Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash stated; "She's great. She's a shot in the arm for this industry. She writes her own music that's not at all contrived. And she's managed to sell loads of records which makes her a great example to the younger artists."[150]
Adele has stated that her biggest musical influences are Etta James and Beyoncé.[151][152] She has also stated that growing up, she listened to the Spice Girls,[153] The Cure, Dusty Springfield,[154] and others. She also claims that her mother, who is very close with her, exposed her to the music of Aaliyah, Lauryn Hill, Mary J. Blige, and Alicia Keys, all of which inspired her as well.[155] One of Adele's earliest influences was British soul artist Gabrielle, who Adele has admired since the age of 5, even performing as the Hackney born star with an eye-patch in a school talent contest.[156]
Adele has named Pink as one of her biggest musical influences and considers Pink's performance at Brixton Academy in London as one of "the most defining moments" in her life, saying "It was the Missundaztood record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live. I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible."[157][158]
At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele won awards in the categories of Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[159] She was also nominated in the categories of Record of the Year and Song of the Year.[160] That same year, Adele was also nominated for three Brit Awards in the categories of Best British Female, Best British Single and Best British Breakthrough Act.[161] Then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sent a thank-you letter to Adele that stated "with the troubles that the country's in financially, you're a light at the end of the tunnel."[162]
With 21 non-consecutive weeks at number 1 in the US, Adele broke the record for the longest number-1 album by a woman in Billboard history, beating the record formerly held by Whitney Houston's soundtrack The Bodyguard.[96] 21 spent its 23rd week at number one in March 2012, making it the longest-running album at number one since 1985[11] and it became the fourth best-selling album of the past 10 years in the United States.[163]
In February 2012, Adele was listed at number five on VH1′s 100 Greatest Women In Music.[23] In April 2012, American magazine Time named Adele one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[24][164] People named her one of 2012 Most Beautiful at Every Age.[165] On 30 April 2012, a tribute to Adele was held at New York City's (Le) Poisson Rouge called Broadway Sings Adele, starring various Broadway actors such as Matt Doyle.[166] In July 2012, Adele was listed at number six in Forbes list of the world's highest-paid celebrities under the age of 30 having earned £23 million ($35 million) between May 2011 and May 2012.[167]
On the week ending 3 March 2012, Adele became the first solo female artist to have three singles in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, and the first female artist to have two albums in the top 5 of the Billboard 200 and two singles in the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously.[18] Adele topped the 2012 Sunday Times Rich List of musicians in the UK under 30[168] and made the Top 10 of Billboard magazine's "Top 40 Money Makers".[169] Billboard also announced the same day that Adele's "Rolling in the Deep" is the biggest crossover hit of the past 25 years, topping pop, adult pop and adult contemporary charts and that Adele is one of four female artists to have an album chart at number one for more than 13 weeks (the other three artists being Judy Garland, Carole King, and Whitney Houston).[170] On 6 March, 21 reached 30 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Australian ARIA Chart, making it the longest-running number one album in Australia in the 21st century, and the second longest-running number one ever.[171]
At the 2012 Ivor Novello Awards in May, Adele was named Songwriter of the Year, and "Rolling in the Deep" won the award for Most Performed Work of 2011.[172] At the 2012 BMI Awards held in London in October, Adele won Song of the Year (for "Rolling in the Deep") in recognition of the song being the most played on US television and radio in 2011.[173]
In 2013, Adele won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the James Bond theme "Skyfall". This is the first James Bond song to win and only the fifth to be nominated (after "For Your Eyes Only" (1981), "Nobody Does It Better" (1977) (from The Spy Who Loved Me), "Live and Let Die" (1973), and "The Look of Love" (1967) (from the original Casino Royale)).[174][175] "Skyfall" won the Brit Award for Best British Single at the 2013 BRIT Awards.[176]
She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to music.[177] In February 2013 she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.[178]
Adele has performed in numerous charity concerts throughout her career. In July and November 2008, Adele performed at the Keep a Child Alive Black Ball in London and New York City respectively.[179][180][181] On 17 September 2009, Adele performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, for the VH1 Divas event, a concert to raise money for the Save The Music Foundation charity.[182][183] On 6 December, Adele opened with a 40-minute set at John Mayer's 2nd Annual Holiday Charity Revue held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California.[184] In 2011, Adele gave a free concert for Pride London, a registered charity which arranges LGBT events in London.[185]

Adele is one of the best-selling artists of our time due to her powerful and incredible voice, moving lyrics and outspoken personality.
Adele is one of the UK’s best-selling singer/songwriters and having taken some time away from the music industry after the birth of her first child, Angelo, she is now working on her third album. But where did it all start?
Her full name is Adele Laurie Blue Adkins and she was born to single mother Penny Adkins on 5 May 1988 in Tottenham, North London. She is estranged from her Welsh father Mark Evans. She started singing at the age of four years and has stated the Spice Girls heavily influenced her decision to start.
Talking about her unmusical family, Adele has said, 'It all comes from impersonating The Spice Girls and Gabrielle.' She used to give little concerts in her room for her mother and her friends. As her mother was quite arty, she helped a young Adele impersonate Gabrielle by making an eye patch for her to wear. At the age of 11, the family moved to Brighton but returned to Brixton where Adele remembers watching Pink in concert.
It was only when a record producer friend of her father asked a teenage Adele to sing a cover of Heart of Glass after hearing her 'wicked' voice did she realise her calling as a musician. She went to secondary school in West Norwood and it was here that she came across R&B singers, such as Mary J Blige, that have influenced her songs. Speaking of her time at school, she explained that she wanted to perform but found it hard as she was told she would need to learn the clarinet to be a part of the choir.
As a result, she upped sticks and moved to the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in Croydon. She has said about her time at the school: 'If I hear someone's from stage school I'd think they were a dickhead, and I know it might make me sound like that. But it had free rehearsal rooms and free equipment and I was listening to music all day, every day for years. The music course was really wicked. There was no dancing or anything like that. No jazz hands.'
In May 2006, she graduated and joined other famous alumni such as Amy Winehouse, Kate Nash and the Feeling. This was when she was first noticed by record labels despite the fact she had had a MySpace page since the end of 2004.
She was invited for a meeting with XL and was so nervous that she took a friend with her. The rest, as they say, is history!
In September 2006, she was signed by XL and her manager was confirmed as Jonathan Dickens. She provided vocals on Jamie Penate's song My Yvonne and met producer Jim Abbiss, with whom she has worked with since.
Her breakthrough single Hometown Glory, which was written about West Norwood, was released in October 2007. Adele went on to support Will Young at the 2007 MENCAP Little Noise Sessions, which was a charity concert. By 2008, she was the headliner and had been named the number-one breakthrough act of the year in an annual BBC poll. She also won the Brit Awards' Critic Choice prize that year.
Her first album 19 was named for her age at the time and was released in February 2008. It went straight to number one after the success of her second single Chasing Pavements, which had been released two weeks previously on 18 January. This song debuted at number two and stayed in the UK charts for four months.
Adele was nominated for the Mercury Prize for her album in 2008 as well as a Q Awards nomination for Best Breakthrough Act. She won an Urban Music award for Best Jazz Act before signing with Columbia Records to start her foray into the US.
She started a tour of North America and 19 was released in June 2008 but by October that year it appeared as though she wouldn't make it in the US. She had cancelled some of her tour dates to be with a former boyfriend and was drinking too much. That was until she performed Chasing Pavements and Cold Shoulder on an episode of Saturday Night Live with Sarah Palin. After the show, which was watched by 17 million people, her album reached number 11 in the Billboard Charts.
In November 2008, she moved to Notting Hill and gave up drinking. In February 2009, her debut album went platinum in the US having sold 2.2 million copies. She also won Grammys for Best New Artist and Best Female Vocal Performance in 2009 and was nominated for three Brit awards.
Then prime minister Gordon Brown is also thought to have sent Adele a thank you note for 'being the light at the end of the tunnel' despite the country's financial problems.
Adele's second album 21, which was her age at the time, was released on 24 January 2011 in the UK and on 22 February in the US. She has claimed that the album was inspired by her break-up with a former partner. It was a change in direction from her first record as it incorporated aspects of country music.
It reached number one in more than 26 countries including the UK and US, while an emotional performance of Someone Like You at the Brits on 15 February 2011 rocketed the track to number one. Adele's first album also re-entered the charts while her first two singles from 21 – Rolling In The Deep and Someone Like You were both in the top five. For the first time since the Beatles in 1964, a living British musician had two singles and two albums in the top-five at the same time.By December 2011, both songs had broken sales records and her second album had sold more than 3.4 million copies. It also overtook Amy Winehouse's Back to Black as the best-selling album of the 21st century.
Her third single from the album Set Fire To The Rain also reached number one and Adele embarked on a worldwide tour in October 2011. However, she had to cancel two shows to undergo vocal cord surgery in the US due to a vocal cord haemorrhage that could have led to permanent damage of her voice.
Since then, she has recovered and won six Grammy as well as five Brits. 21 went back to number one in February 2012 and has become the fifth best-selling album of all time in the UK.
Adele gave birth to a son, Angelo, on 19 October 2012. The father is her partner Simon Konecki, whom she moved in with in February 2012.
At the 2013 Grammy awards, she also confirmed that she was in the very early stages of her third album and was having meetings while staying in Los Angeles for the Oscars.

      Prior to hitting the big time as a singer, Adele once lived in a 1BR flat directly above the bookstore run by Hugh Grant in the movie Notting Hill (1999).
      Even after making a victorious splash at the 51st Grammy Awards (8 Feb. 2009), the singer surprised everybody when she took a job at the London-based "Rough Trade" record store as a personal exercise in learning about the basics of the music industry and getting an insider's view of the up-and-coming talent.
      Adele's victorious performance at the 54th Grammy Awards (12 February 2012) was the first time she'd sung in public since her throat surgery in Boston (Nov. 2011) where renowned throat surgeon Dr. Steven Zeitels performed the successful operation.

      She was awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2013 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to Music. She is a singer and songwriter.
      I'm learning about tax at the moment with my accountant - pffffff! I use the NHS, I can't use public transport any more, doing what I do, I went to state school, I'm mortified to have to pay 50 per cent! Trains are always late, most state schools are shit and I've gotta give you like four million quid, are you 'avin a laugh? When I got my tax bill in from 19 I was ready to go 'n' buy a gun and randomly open fire.
      [on singing her songs of heartbreak] Imagine if you weren't in an office job or whatever, and you were performing your feelings as I do. It's kind of like not getting over something isn't it, because every night you have to talk about it.
      I love food and hate exercise. I don't have time to work out. I don't want to be on the cover of Playboy or Vogue. I want to be on the cover of Rolling Stone or Q. I'm not a trend-setter. I'm a singer. I'd rather weigh a ton and make an amazing album than look like Nicole Richie and do a shit album. My aim in life is never to be skinny.
      When it comes to staying myself - my career isn't my life, it doesn't come home with me. So it's a piece of piss staying grounded and not being changed by it. The same things I've always liked still satisfy me. My team's the same and my group of friends are the same. Of course I'm bowled over by people's response to "21," and when I meet artists I love, it blows my mind. But it baffles me as well. I go home and my best friend laughs at me, rather than going to a celebrity-studded party to rub shoulders with people who know me but who I don't know. I'm Z-list when it comes to that shit.
      Heartbreak can definitely give you a deeper sensibility for writing songs. I drew on a lot of heartbreak when I was writing my first album, I didn't mean to but I just did.

AdeleSingerBorn: 5 May 1988Birthplace: London, EnglandBest known as: The British vocalist who sang "Someone Like You"Name at birth: Adele Laurie Blue AdkinsAdele is the British singer whose 2008 debut album won two Grammy Awards and made her a leading pop singer in the U.K and the United States. Adele Adkins (who performs under her first name alone) was raised in London, grew up imitating the Spice Girls at home, and began singing in earnest at age 14, according to her official biography. After posting songs to MySpace.com, Adele was discovered by XL Recordings in 2006. Her 2008 debut album, 19, included the singles "Hometown Glory" and "Chasing Pavements" and won her Grammy Awards as best new artist and (for "Chasing Pavements") best female pop vocal performance. Never a pop waif, Adele is known for her smoky voice and plus-sized body, which she uses to belt out power ballads and soul-tinged pop. (Her voice "could stop traffic," journalist Paul Rees once told the BBC.) Her follow-up album, 21, was released in 2011, debuted at #1 on the U.K. music charts, and stayed there for 10 straight weeks, selling millions of copies. It was helped along by the acclaimed heartbreak-of-romance single "Someone Like You," which became a big hit after Adele performed it at the BRIT Awards in February of 2011. Adele had surgery on her vocal cords later that year, temporarily derailing her rise, but returned to perform "Rolling in the Deep" at the Grammy Awards in 2012. That night she took home all six Grammys she was nominated for: album of the year and best pop album (both for 21), song of the year and record of the year and best short-form music video (all for "Rolling in the Deep"), and best pop vocal performance (for "Someone Like You"). She also sang the theme song to the 2012 James Bond movie Skyfall and earned an Oscar nomination for best original song.Extra credit: Her first child, a son with boyfriend Simon Konecki, was born in October of 2012.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.
