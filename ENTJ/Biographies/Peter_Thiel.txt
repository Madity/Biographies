Peter Andreas Thiel (born October 11, 1967) is an American entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and hedge fund manager. Thiel cofounded PayPal with Max Levchin and served as its CEO. He also cofounded Palantir, of which he is chairman. He serves as president of Clarium Capital, a global macro hedge fund with $700 million in assets under management; a managing partner in Founders Fund, a venture capital fund with $2 billion in assets under management; and cofounder and investment committee chair of Mithril Capital Management.[4][5] He was the first outside investor in Facebook, the popular social-networking site, with a 10.2% stake acquired in 2004 for $500,000, and sits on the company's board of directors. Thiel was ranked #293 on the Forbes 400 in 2011, with a net worth of $1.5 billion as of March 2012.[2] He was ranked #4 on the Forbes Midas List of 2014 at $2.2 billion. [6] Thiel lives in San Francisco, California.[7]
Born to German parents in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany, Thiel moved to the United States with his parents when he was a toddler, and was raised in Foster City, California.[8] Thiel was a US-rated Chess Master and one of the highest ranked under-21 players in the country.
Thiel studied 20th-century philosophy as an undergraduate at Stanford University. He received his B.A. in Philosophy from Stanford in 1989 and acquired a J.D. from Stanford Law School in 1992.[9]
An avowed libertarian, he founded The Stanford Review in 1987 along with Norman Book. The Stanford Review became famous for challenging campus mores including political correctness and laws against hate speech. The Stanford Review is now the university's main conservative/libertarian newspaper.
Thiel formed friendships with other students at Stanford, many of whom contributed to the Stanford Review. These include Keith Rabois, David O. Sacks, and Reid Hoffman. Some of these friends later took up jobs at PayPal (co-founded by Thiel) and became part of the PayPal Mafia.
While studying at Stanford, Thiel also encountered René Girard, whose mimetic theory influenced him.
Thiel clerked for Judge J.L. Edmondson of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.[citation needed] From 1993 to 1996, he traded derivatives for Credit Suisse Group.[10] He founded Thiel Capital Management, a multistrategy fund, in 1996.
In 1998 Thiel co-founded PayPal, an online payments system, with Max Levchin. The company later merged with X.com, then headed by Elon Musk. PayPal went public on February 15, 2002, and was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion later that year.[11] Thiel's 3.7 percent stake in PayPal was worth approximately $55 million at the time of the acquisition.[12]
According to Eric Jackson's account of PayPal in his book The PayPal Wars, Thiel viewed PayPal's mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation. Jackson recalls an inspirational speech by Thiel in 1999:
"We're definitely onto something big. The need PayPal answers is monumental. Everyone in the world needs money – to get paid, to trade, to live. Paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment. You can run out of it. It wears out. It can get lost or stolen. In the twenty-first century, people need a form of money that's more convenient and secure, something that can be accessed from anywhere with a PDA or an Internet connection. Of course, what we're calling 'convenient' for American users will be revolutionary for the developing world. Many of these countries' governments play fast and loose with their currencies," the former derivatives trader [referring to Thiel] noted, before continuing, "They use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations, like we saw in Russia and several Southeast Asian countries last year [referring to the 1998 Russian financial crisis and 1997 Asian financial crisis], to take wealth away from their citizens. Most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like U.S. dollars. Eventually PayPal will be able to change this. In the future, when we make our service available outside the U.S. and as Internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people, PayPal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before. It will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or Pounds or Yen, in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure."[13]
Immediately after selling PayPal, Thiel launched a global macro hedge fund, Clarium Capital, pursuing a global macro strategy. In 2005 Clarium was honored as global macro fund of the year by both MarHedge and Absolute Return, two trade magazines. Thiel’s approach to investing became the subject of a chapter in Steve Drobny’s book, Inside the House of Money. Thiel successfully bet that the U.S. dollar would weaken in 2003, and gained significant returns betting that the dollar and energy would rally in 2005. After significant losses starting in 2009, Clarium dropped from $7 billion in assets in 2008 to around $350 million in 2011.[14]
In 2004, well before the financial crisis of 2007–2010 bore him out in general terms, Thiel spoke of the dot-com bubble of 2000 having migrated, in effect, into a growing bubble in the financial sector. He specified General Electric, with its large financing arm, and WalMart as vulnerable. To illustrate, in 2004, he reported having backed away from buying Martha Stewart's Manhattan duplex for $7 million in the winter of 2003-2004.[10] While the apartment did sell in 2004 for $6.65 million to another buyer, it was on the market but unsold in early 2010 at $15.9 million,[15] and later at the reduced price of $13.9 million.[16]
In August 2004, Thiel made a $500,000 angel investment in the social network Facebook for 10.2% of the company and joined Facebook's board. This was the first outside investment in Facebook,[3][17] and Thiel went on to be portrayed in The Social Network (2010) by actor Wallace Langham.
In his book The Facebook Effect, David Kirkpatrick outlines the story of how Thiel came to make his investment: former Napster and Plaxo employee Sean Parker, who at the time had assumed the title of "President" of Facebook, was seeking investors for Facebook. Parker approached Reid Hoffman, the CEO of work-based social network LinkedIn. Hoffman liked Facebook but declined to be the lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest with his duties as LinkedIn CEO. He redirected Parker to Thiel, whom he knew from their PayPal days (both Hoffman and Thiel are considered members of the PayPal Mafia). Thiel met Parker and Mark Zuckerberg, the Harvard college student who had founded Facebook and controlled it. Thiel and Zuckerberg got along well and Thiel agreed to lead Facebook's seed round with $500,000 for 10.2% of the company. Hoffman and Mark Pincus also participated in the round. The investment was originally in the form of a convertible note, to be converted to equity if Facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004. Although Facebook narrowly missed the target, Thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway.[18] Thiel said of his investment:
"I was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision. And it was a very reasonable valuation. I thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment."[18]
As a board member, Thiel was not actively involved in Facebook's day-to-day decision making. According to Sarah Lacy, Thiel's main advice to Zuckerberg in their initial years was "Just don’t fuck it up."[19] However, he did provide help with timing the various rounds of funding. Zuckerberg credited Thiel with helping him time Facebook's 2007 Series D to close before the 2007–2010 financial crisis.[20]
In September 2010, Thiel, while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer Internet sector, argued that relative to other Internet companies, Facebook (which then had a secondary market valuation of $30 billion) was comparatively undervalued.[21] Facebook's IPO was in May 2012, with a market cap of nearly $100 billion ($38 a share), at which time Thiel sold 16.8 million shares for $638 million.[22] In August 2012, immediately upon the conclusion of the early investor lock out period, Thiel sold almost all of his remaining stake for between $19.27 and $20.69 per share, or $395.8 million, for a total of more than $1 billion.[22][23] He still retained 5 million shares and a seat on the board of directors.[24]
In 2005 Thiel created Founders Fund, a San Francisco based venture capital fund. Other partners in the fund include Sean Parker, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek.
In addition to Facebook, Thiel has made early-stage investments in numerous startups (personally or through his venture capital fund), including Booktrack, Slide, LinkedIn, Friendster, Rapleaf, Geni.com, Yammer, Yelp, Inc., Powerset, Practice Fusion, MetaMed, Vator, Palantir Technologies, IronPort, Votizen, Asana, Big Think, Caplinked, Quora, Rypple, TransferWise, Nanotronics Imaging, Stripe, and Legendary Entertainment. Slide, LinkedIn, Geni.com, and Yammer were founded by Thiel's former colleagues at PayPal, Slide by Levchin, Linkedin by Reid Hoffman, Yelp by Jeremy Stoppelman, Geni.com and Yammer by David Sacks, and Xero by Rod Drury. Fortune magazine reports that PayPal alumni have founded or invested in dozens of startups with an aggregate value of around $30 billion. In Silicon Valley circles, Thiel is colloquially referred to as the "Don of the PayPal Mafia", as noted in the Fortune magazine article.[25] Thiel's views on management are highly regarded, especially his famous observation that start-up success is highly correlated with low CEO pay.
In June 2012, Peter Thiel launched Mithril, a late-stage investment fund with $402 million at the time of launch, intended for companies that were at the cusp between being private and going public.[4][5] Other partners in the fund include Jim O'Neill, co-founder of the Thiel Fellowship, and Ajay Royan, a former managing director at Clarium Capital, a hedge fund started by Thiel.
Thiel carries out most of his philanthropic activities through a nonprofit foundation created by him called the Thiel Foundation.[28]
Thiel concentrates the bulk of his philanthropic efforts on what he sees as potential breakthrough technologies. In November 2010, Thiel organized a Breakthrough Philanthropy conference that showcased eight nonprofits that he believed were working on radical new ideas in technology, government, and human affairs.[29] A similar conference was organized in December 2011 with the name "Fast Forward".[30]
Thiel believes in the importance and desirability of a technological singularity.[31] In February 2006, Thiel provided $100,000 of matching funds to back the Singularity Challenge donation drive of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (then known as the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, he joined the Institute's advisory board and participated in the May 2006 Singularity Summit at Stanford as well as at the 2011 Summit held in New York City.
In May 2007, Thiel provided half of the $400,000 matching funds for the annual Singularity Challenge donation drive.
The organization was a participant in the Breakthrough Philanthropy conference (November 2010) and the Fast Forward conference (December 2011).
In September 2006, Thiel announced that he would donate $3.5 million to foster anti-aging research through the Methuselah Mouse Prize foundation.[32] He gave the following reasons for his pledge: "Rapid advances in biological science foretell of a treasure trove of discoveries this century, including dramatically improved health and longevity for all. I’m backing Dr. [Aubrey] de Grey, because I believe that his revolutionary approach to aging research will accelerate this process, allowing many people alive today to enjoy radically longer and healthier lives for themselves and their loved ones."
The Thiel Foundation supports the research of the SENS Foundation, headed by Dr. de Grey, that is working to achieve the reversal of biological aging. The Thiel Foundation also supports the work of anti-aging researcher Cynthia Kenyon.
The SENS Foundation was a participant in the Breakthrough Philanthropy conference (November 2010) and the Fast Forward conference (December 2011).
On April 15, 2008, Thiel pledged $500,000 to the new Seasteading Institute, directed by Patri Friedman, whose mission is "to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems".[33] This was followed in February 2010 by a subsequent grant of $250,000, and an additional $100,000 in matching funds.[34]
In a talk at the Seasteading Institute conference in November 2009, Thiel explained why he believed that seasteading was necessary for the future of humanity.[35]
In 2011 Thiel was reported as having given a total of $1.25 million to the Seasteading Institute.[36] According to the Daily Mail Peter Thiel was inspired to do so by Ayn Rand's philosophical novel Atlas Shrugged.[37]
The Seasteading Institute was a participant in the Breakthrough Philanthropy conference (November 2010) and the Fast Forward conference (December 2011).
On September 29, 2010, Thiel said he had created a new fellowship called the Thiel Fellowship, which will award $100,000 to 20 people under 20 years old,[38] in order to spur them to quit college and create their own ventures.[39]
In October 2011, the Thiel Foundation announced the creation of Breakout Labs, a grant-making program intended to fund early-stage scientific research that may be too radical or innovative for traditional scientific funding bodies but also too long-term and speculative for venture investors.[40] In April 2012, Breakout Labs announced its first set of grantees.[41]
The Thiel Foundation is also a supporter of the Committee to Protect Journalists, which promotes the right of journalists to report the news freely without fear of reprisal,[42] and the Human Rights Foundation, which organizes the Oslo Freedom Forum.[43]
He is also a supporter of the life extension group the Methuselah Foundation, founded by Aubrey De Grey.[44]
Peter Thiel wrote, on April 13, 2009, in the Libertarian 'Cato Unbound' blog, “Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” In the same article, he also wrote, "Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron."[45]
On September 22, 2010, Thiel said at a 2010 fundraiser for the American Foundation for Equal Rights, “I believe that gay rights and marriage rights for gay people should not be a partisan issue,” and ”Gay marriage can’t be a partisan issue because as long there are partisan issues or cultural issues in this country, you’ll have trench warfare like on the western front in World War I. You’ll have lots of carnage and no progress.”[46]
He wrote an editorial in National Review in 2011 claiming that the world had entered a "tech slowdown" and that 1969 was when "the hippies took over the country, and when the true cultural war over Progress was lost."[47]
Thiel is listed as a member of the Steering Committee of The Bilderberg Group, an annual gathering of royalty, high-ranking political figures and billionaire business executives.[48]
Thiel, who is openly gay, has supported gay-rights causes such as the American Foundation for Equal Rights and GOProud.[50] In 2010, Thiel held Homocon 2010 for GOProud, a LGBT conservative/libertarian, in his New York City apartment. He invited conservative columnist Ann Coulter, who is a friend of his,[51][52] to Homocon 2010 to guest speak.[53] Coulter would later dedicate her new book, Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America, to Thiel.[54] In 2012, Thiel would donate $10,000 to Minnesotans United for All Families, in order to fight Minnesota Amendment 1.[55]
In 2009, it was reported that Thiel helped fund college student James O'Keefe's "Taxpayers Clearing House" video – a satirical look at the politics behind the Wall Street bailout.[56] O'Keefe went on to produce the ACORN undercover sting videos, but through a spokesperson, Thiel denied involvement in — or even knowledge of — the ACORN sting.[56]
In July 2012, after donating $1 million in a single donation, Thiel became the largest contributor to the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative 501(c)4.[57]
Although a member of the Libertarian Party,[1] Thiel donates overwhelmingly more political contributions to Republicans.
In December 2007, Thiel endorsed Ron Paul for President.[58] After Ron Paul failed to secure the Republican nomination for president, Thiel contributed to the John McCain/Sarah Palin presidential ticket of 2008.[59]
In 2010, Thiel supported Meg Whitman, who as CEO of eBay had purchased PayPal from Thiel and his co-founders and investors, in her unsuccessful bid for the governorship of California. He contributed the maximum allowable $25,900 to the Whitman campaign.[60]
In 2012, Thiel, along with PayPal co-founder Luke Nosek and Scott Banister, an early adviser and board member, put their support behind Ron Paul's Endorse Liberty Super PAC, alongside Internet advertising veteran Stephen Oskoui and entrepreneur Jeffrey Harmon, who founded Endorse Liberty in November 2011. Collectively Thiel et al. gave $3.9 million to Endorse Liberty, whose purpose was to promote Texas congressman Ron Paul for president in 2012. As of January 31, 2012[update], Endorse Liberty reported spending about $3.3 million promoting Paul by setting up two YouTube channels, buying ads from Google and Facebook and StumbleUpon, and building a presence on the Web.[61] At the 2012 Republican National Convention, Thiel held a private meeting with Rand Paul and Ron Paul's presidential delegates to discuss "the future of the Liberty Movement."[62] After Ron Paul again failed to secure the Republican nomination for president, Thiel contributed to the Mitt Romney/Paul Ryan presidential ticket of 2012.[59]
Other Republican politicians Thiel has contributed donations to include Rep. James E. Rogan, Don Stenberg, Sen. John Thune Douglas Forrester, Rep. Robin Hayes, Sen. John Cornyn, Sen. Elizabeth Dole, Sen. Lamar Alexander, State Sen. Dick Monteith, Rep. Lee Terry, Sen. Chuck Hagel, Rep. Dan Lungren, Rep. Bob Beauprez, Rep. Mike Simpson, Rep. Tom Tancredo, Rep. Mary Bono, Gov. Butch Otter, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Rep. Nancy Johnson, Rep. Scott Garrett, Rep. Tim Johnson, Rep. Bill Thomas, Sen. Jeff Flake, Sen. Jim DeMint, Sen. Jim Talent, Rep. Denny Rehberg, Rep. Rob Simmons, Rep. Jon Porter, Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, Rep. Ed Royce, Sen. Susan Collins, Sen. Gordon H. Smith, Rep. Bob Schaffer, John Neely Kennedy, Sen. Norm Coleman, Rep. Mike Coffman, Rep. Eric Cantor, John Raese, Dino Rossi, Ryan Brumberg, Sen. Rand Paul, Randy Altschuler, Rep. Justin Amash, State Sen. Richard Tisei, Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Ted Cruz, Josh Mandel, and Sen. Orrin Hatch.[59][63][64][65][66][67][68][69]
The only Democrat Thiel has contributed donations to is Ro Khanna. Khanna has been criticized by members of his own party as a "fiscal conservative", "libertarian",[70] and "Republican lite."[71]
Thiel inherited his Christian beliefs from his parents. He grew up as an evangelical, but he describes his beliefs as “somewhat heterodox,” complicated by his cultural liberalism. “I believe Christianity is true,” he said. “I don’t sort of feel a compelling need to convince other people of that.” Sonia Arrison, the author of “100 Plus,” a book on research into life extension, first met Thiel in 2003, when she heard him give a lunch talk about the failure of the U.S. Constitution. Eight years later, they are close friends, but she has no idea of his religious beliefs. “He won’t tell me what he is,” she said. “He thinks I should just know. He would never tell me whether he believes in God.”[72]
During his time at Stanford, he had attended a lecture given by a French professor named René Girard, which had led him to Girard’s books, and he became a devotee. Girard had developed a theory of mimetic desire, of people learning to want and compete for the same things, which attempted to explain the origins of violence. Girard, a conservative Catholic, explained the role of sacrifice and the scapegoat in resolving social conflict, which appealed to Thiel, offering a basis for his Christian belief without the fundamentalism of his parents.[73]
Thiel is an occasional commentator on CNBC, having appeared numerous times on both Closing Bell with Kelly Evans, and Squawk Box with Becky Quick.[74] He has been interviewed twice by Charlie Rose on PBS.[75]
Thiel has contributed articles to The Wall Street Journal, First Things, Forbes, and Policy Review, the journal published by the Hoover Institution, on whose board he sits.
Thiel is supposedly the inspiration for the Peter Gregory character on HBO's Silicon Valley (TV series)[76]
In 2006, Thiel won the Herman Lay Award for Entrepreneurship.[77] In 2007, he was honored as a Young Global leader by the World Economic Forum as one of the 250 most distinguished leaders age 40 and under.[78] On November 7, 2009, Thiel was awarded an honorary degree from Universidad Francisco Marroquin[79] In 2012, Students For Liberty, an organization dedicated to spreading libertarian ideals on college campuses, awarded Thiel its "Alumnus of the Year" award, and Thiel delivered the keynote address at the 2012 International Students For Liberty Conference.[80]
Thiel is the co-author, with David O. Sacks, of the 1995 book The Diversity Myth: 'Multiculturalism' and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford. The book was critical of what it perceived as political correctness and a dilution of academic rigor. It "drew a sharp rebuttal from then-Stanford Provost (and later President George W. Bush's National Security Advisor) Condoleezza Rice."[3] According to his 2011 New Yorker profile, Thiel has backtracked somewhat from his assertions in the book:
“All of the identity-related things are in my mind much more nuanced,” he said. “I think there is a gay experience, I think there is a black experience, I think there is a woman’s experience that is meaningfully different. I also think there was a tendency to exaggerate it and turn it into an ideological category.” But his reaction against political correctness, he said, was just as narrowly ideological.[14]
Thiel was the co-producer of “Thank You for Smoking”, a 2005 feature film based on Christopher Buckley's 1994 novel of the same name.[81]

The credo of Thiel’s venture-capital firm: “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” Photograph by Robert Maxwell.
Peter Thiel pulled an iPhone out of his jeans pocket and held it up. “I don’t consider this to be a technological breakthrough,” he said. “Compare this with the Apollo space program.” Thiel, an entrepreneur who runs both a hedge fund and a venture-capital firm, was waiting for a table at Café Venetia, which is on University Avenue in downtown Palo Alto, California. The street is the launchpad of Silicon Valley. All the café’s tables were occupied by healthy, downwardly dressed people using Apple devices while discussing idea creation and angel investments. Ten years ago, Thiel met his friend Elon Musk for coffee at the same spot, and decided that PayPal, the online-payments company they had helped found, should go public. Soon after the initial public offering, in 2002, PayPal was sold to eBay for one and a half billion dollars, and Thiel’s take was fifty-five million.Most of Thiel’s fortune was made within shouting distance of Café Venetia. PayPal’s first office was five blocks down the street, above a bike shop. Just across the street was 156 University Avenue, the original headquarters of Facebook. In the summer of 2004, Thiel gave a Harvard dropout named Mark Zuckerberg a half-million-dollar loan, the first outside investment in Facebook, which Thiel later converted into a seven-per-cent ownership stake and a seat on the board; his share today is worth at least one and a half billion dollars. Facebook’s successor at 156 University Avenue is Palantir Technologies, whose software helps government agencies track down terrorists, fraudsters, and other criminals, by detecting subtle patterns in torrents of information. Thiel co-founded Palantir in 2004 and invested thirty million dollars in it. Palantir is now valued at two and a half billion dollars, and Thiel is the chairman of the board. He might be the most successful technology investor in the world.The information age has made Thiel rich, but it has also been a disappointment to him. It hasn’t created enough jobs, and it hasn’t produced revolutionary improvements in manufacturing and productivity. The creation of virtual worlds turns out to be no substitute for advances in the physical world. “The Internet—I think it’s a net plus, but not a big one,” he said. “Apple is an innovative company, but I think it’s mostly a design innovator.” Twitter has a lot of users, but it doesn’t employ that many Americans: “Five hundred people will have job security for the next decade, but how much value does it create for the entire economy? It may not be enough to dramatically improve living standards in the U.S. over the next decade or two decades.” Facebook was, he said, “on balance positive,” because of the social disruptions it had created—it was radical enough to have been “outlawed in China.” That’s the most he will say for the celebrated era of social media.Thiel rarely updates his Facebook page. He “never adapted to the BlackBerry/iPhone/e-mail thing,” and began texting only a year ago. He hasn’t quite mastered the voice-recognition system in his sports car. Though he owns a seven-million-dollar mansion in San Francisco’s Marina District, and bought a twenty-seven-million-dollar oceanfront property in Maui in July, he sees the staggering rise in Silicon Valley’s real-estate values as a sign not of progress but of “how people have found it very hard to keep up.” There was almost never a free table at Café Venetia, he noted, or anywhere else on University Avenue, throwing the sanity of local housing prices into further question. Silicon Valley exuberance had become yet another sign of blinkered élite thinking. Thiel—who grew up middle class, earned degrees from Stanford and Stanford Law School, worked at a white-shoe New York law firm and a premier Wall Street investment bank, employs two assistants and a chef, and is currently reading obscure essays by the philosopher Leo Strauss—holds élites in contempt. “This is always a problem with élites, they’re always skewed in an optimistic direction,” he said. “It may be true to an even greater extent at present. If you were born in 1950, and you were in the top-tenth percentile economically, everything got better for twenty years automatically. Then, after the late sixties, you went to a good grad school, and you got a good job on Wall Street in the late seventies, and then you hit the boom. Your story has been one of incredible, unrelenting progress for sixty-one years. Most people who are sixty-one years old in the U.S.? Not their story at all.”When Thiel questions the Internet’s significance, it’s not out of an indifference to technology. He’s enraptured with it. Indeed, his main lament is that America—the country that invented the modern assembly line, the skyscraper, the airplane, and the personal computer—has lost its belief in the future. Thiel thinks that Americans who are beguiled by mere gadgetry have forgotten how expansive technological change can be. He looks back to the fifties and sixties, the heyday of popularized science and technology in this country, as a time when visions of a radically different future were commonplace. A key book for Thiel is “The American Challenge,” by the French writer J. J. Servan-Schreiber, which was published in 1967 and became a global best-seller. Servan-Schreiber argued that the dynamic forces of technology and education in the U.S. were leaving the rest of the world behind, and foresaw, by 2000, a post-industrial utopia in America. Time and space would no longer be barriers to communication, income inequality would shrink, and computers would set people free: “There will be only four work days a week of seven hours per day. The year will be comprised of 39 work weeks and 13 weeks of vacation. . . . All this within a single generation.”

				Early Facebook investor Peter Thiel has another huge winner with big-data consultancy Palantir Technologies, which he also cofounded. Palantir raised money in December at a $9 billion valuation, making Thiel's estimated 12% stake (the largest) worth more than $1 billion. Thiel, a cofounder of PayPal, still sits on Facebook's board but sold most of his 10% stake in the social networking company following its May 2012 IPO. His various venture firms include Founders Fund, whose stated goal is to invest in companies that it says can affect dramatic technological change. Notable investments include Airbnb, Practice Fusion and payments company Stripe. Ideological to the point of eccentricity, Thiel believes technology rarely repeats itself: "There's a sense in which technology is, by definition, non-repetitive. And every moment in technological history only happens once." As Palantir's chairman, Thiel has personally invested $40 million in the Palo Alto, Calif. firm. He firmly believes the company could be just as valuable as Facebook.  [...] more

An investing genius, Peter Thiel is perhaps one of the most successful venture capitalist in the tech industry. Prominently known as the co-founder of PayPal, the electronic payment site and as the first angel investor in Facebook, Thiel has acquired a reputation of one of the most influential Silicon Valley figures. He is a self-confessed libertarian who developed his keen competitiveness and intellectual skills playing the game of chess. His brimming self-confidence and brilliance astonished everyone since his days at school. A loner of sorts, Peter was a math genius and a national level chess player in his home country, Germany.  One story has it that he carried a chess board with a sticker which said “ Born to  Win”.
In 1996, Peter founded Thiel Capital Management, a multi strategy fund, which was a pre-cursor to his next venture, PayPal. He co-founded PayPal, with some of his like minded friends and took the company public on February 15, 2002. A year later he sold the company to eBay for $1.5bn and turned towards his most successful career till now, Investing. With 3.7 percent stake in PayPal which earned him $55M at the time of the acquisition, he started Clarium Capital Management. His company invested in many successful startups like Friendster, LinkedIn (founded by his friend Ried Hoffman), Rapleaf, Geni.com, Yelp.Inc, Palantir and Votizen among others. By 2008, Clarium had assets which were worth more than seven billion dollars. However, changing stock dynamics reduced his company to just three hundred and fifty million dollars in 2010, two-thirds of which is Thiel’s personal capital.
But he made one wise decision during that course of time which has helped him earn him a billionaire tag and even a 45 second depiction in an Academy award winning movie. In the summer of 2004, Hoffman, who had recently founded LinkedIn, and Sean Parker, the Silicon Valley enfant terrible, introduced Thiel to Mark Zuckerberg, who was looking for a major investor in Facebook, then a site for college students. He invested with a capital of $500,000 in return of 7 percent shares of Facebook. Today with a $100 billion dollar evaluation Facebook is staring at one of the biggest IPO and Thiel’s shares make him richer by more than $2 billion.
He doesn’t shies from living a splendid life. He regularly has intelligent discussions with his friends over dinner at his $70 million house that sits grandly between the Presidio and the bay in San Francisco. He drives around in a Mercedes SL500 and loves to hang out in coffee shops. His favorite movie is Star Wars and has Darth Vader replicas in his office in a stylish brick-and-glass building at the edge of San Francisco’s Presidio Park.  He dreams of a technological utopian world, where everyone has a robot driven car and lives up to at least 150 years. Peter has invested millions of dollars in Seasteading

Features: The Makena property was built in 1991 and has over 4,500 square feet of living space. This oceanfront property comes with a pool and all other expected luxuries that come with a Hawaain Villa.  The sellers were Dan Huish, the founder of private-label laundry- and dish-product maker Huish Detergents, and his wife, Kim. They bought the property in 2006 for $19.2 million.  Simple mathematics show that the couple have made an healthy profit of $8 million. 
The real estate business is filled with rumors that Peter Thiel, the genius investor has bought the historic Dave Chasen Residence in Los Angeles. The house which was built on a residential plot back in 1950s provides one of the best panoramic views of the, which extends all the way from San Gabriel mountains to the Pacific Ocean. 
Location: The Dave Chasen Residence is located in the city of Hollywood “LA”, California above the Sunset Strip.
Accomodations:  The Paul Williams-designed house belonged to the Dave Chasen and his wife Maude who was a famous restaurateur. The 6000 square feet foot home has four bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also boasts of a pool which provides scenic views of the city.  The previous owners had the home redesigned by Neil Korpinen and Rick Erickson. Thiel closed the sale in early February 2012, and reportedly paid around $11 million for the pad.
Neighborhood: The Sunset Strip has the highest concentration of celebrities living in Los Angeles. Some of the names that make the list are Halle Berry, Paris Hilton, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robbie Williams. 
A combination of sources suggests that Mr. Peter Thiel bought a 4-storey mansion in September 2009 for $6.5 million. The property comprises of two side by side houses and was initially for sale at an asking rate of $8.1 million, which quickly dropped to $7.4 million and eventually Mr. Theil was able to scoop it at even a lower price point.
Location:  The mega mansion faces the Beaux Art-style Palace of Fine Arts on one side and has the gorgeous Golden Gate Bridge on the other and is located in Marina District area of San Francisco.
Accommodations: The mansion is the work of world famous architects Remick Associates and comes with 5 bedrooms, five and a half washroom and a two- car garage.  However almost instantly after buying the mansion, Peter Theil wanted to rework the interiors of the place and for this he chose his favorite interior designer and Fog-city based decorator Shane Reilly. Although the place exhibits a classical architecture on the exterior, it has got a more modern and suave interiors on the inside. The home also has a private office that adjoins the master suite, and a roof top pavilion with marble-faced fireplace. 
Peter Thiel has been playing chess since he was in 5th standard. He was so good at it that he carried a chess board with a sticker that said “Born to win”. Even if he lost in college, he would sweep the pieces off the board and say, “Show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser. Peter was a US-rated Chess Master and one of the highest ranked under-21 players in the country.
Peter Thiel is a super fan of Lord of the Rings series. He has read the fantasy novel multiple times and still reads it whenever he finds the time. In fact he has named one of his firm Valar Ventures J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings universe. He has also invested in a couple of other ventures in New Zealand which he calls a utopian country. Coincidentally, the Lord of the Rings series was filmed in New Zealand itself. 
Peter Theil owns a Mercedes SL500, which is a masterpiece of beauty crafted from the eminent car manufacturers Mercedes. Featuring a unique blend of beauty, smoothness, safety and power, SL500 is considered one of the finest automobile ever made. Equipped with a 5.5-litre V8 quiet engine developing 315hp, it offers greater power and refinement. The majestic car features a top speed of 155mph and easily attains 0-60mph in just 5.4 seconds. Its four-wheel fully independent suspension offers a comfy ride minimizing all road bumps while the influential braking system provides immense stopping power when needed.
Featuring a unique blend of beauty, smoothness, safety and power, SL500 is considered one of the finest automobile ever made 
Peter Theil has pulled all strings to ensure his idea of a utopian society is just not another fiction based story but becomes a practical reality. He was the first one to invest in the Seasteading Institute, a libertarian nonprofit group founded in 2008 by Patri Friedman. Seasteading is basically establishing new mini-countries on floating platforms in international waters, which will not be subjected to the laws of any nation.
Built on moveable platforms, similar to those that support oil rigs, these “countries” will be able to house at least a population of 270. He supports the idea big time and has poured in $1.5 million till now. To general population this may seem a distant reality, but Thiel is highly optimistic and has envisioned a fully settled island country by 2019.  According to his estimates, there will be a micro-web of such countries connected to each other and over 10 million floating citizens residing on them by 2050. 
Peter Thiel has a knack of investing in some of the most successful startups in the tech industry. But right now he is concentrating on investing in companies which have less to do with financial returns than his utopian ideas. One such organization is the Methuselah Foundation, for which he gave three and a half million dollars. The aim of the foundation is to reverse human aging aiming ultimately at immortality. 
Mr. Peter Thiel has established The Thiel Foundation to initiate radical reforms in every possible dimension: political, personal, and economic. The main highlights of the foundation are the Thiel Fellowships, where Peter Thiel is giving a grant of $100, 000 to 20 such students who are willing to leave college and pursue a breakthrough idea that can help change the world for better.  “If you have a good idea, the right time to work on it is right away,” said Thiel in a statement, “Our first class of fellows is busy working on difficult challenges to improve the lives of people across the world, and we’re looking forward to helping 20 more people skip college and start changing the world.” The Thiel Foundation affiliates itself with innovative scientific research and new technologies that empower people to improve their lives. 
The PayPal founder and former CEO, Mr. Peter Thiel uses an iPhone. However he is not so impressed with the device which has taken the world by storm since its introduction. His views on the iPhone are visible in this quote “I don’t consider this to be a technological breakthrough”. More so he believes that what Apple does is nothing revolutionary, they are just design innovators.
