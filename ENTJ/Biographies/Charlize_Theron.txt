 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Charlize Theron grew up on a farm outside Benoni, South Africa, as the only child. She got an education as a ballet dancer and has danced both the "Swan Lake" and "The Nutcracker". There wasn't much for a young actress or dancer to do in South Africa, so she soon traveled to Europe and United States of America, where she got job at the Joffrey Ballet in New York. She was also able to work as a photo model. However, an injured knee put a halt to her dancing career.At the age of 18, her mother made her go to Los Angeles to try a career in the movie industry. She came to Los Angeles without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on Hollywood Boulevard an agent gave her his card. After eight months in Los Angeles she got her first part. Since then, she took acting lessons and her career skyrocketed in The Devil's Advocate (1997).
          Charlize Theron was born in Benoni, a city in the greater Johannesburg-area, South Africa on August 7th, 1975, to Gerda Theron and Charles Theron (she was named after him). She has French, Dutch, and German ancestry.Charlize began her modeling career in 1991 aged 16 when she won a local modeling contest. She started modeling in Europe and came to New York a year later. She didn't like being a model though, and decided to try her luck with ballet, which had been her biggest passion as a child. Unfortunately, a knee injury prevented her from dancing. Her mother bought her a one-way ticket to Los Angeles in 1994 and Charlize started visiting all of the agents on Hollywood Boulevard but without any luck. She went to the bank to cash a check for $500 she'd got from her mother and became furious when she learned that the bank could not cash her check because it was an out-state check. She made a scene and an agent gave her his card, in exchange that she learn the language, which she did by watching soap operas on TV. Her first role was as a young mother in a park in a B-film in 1995, but it was a non-speaking role with three seconds of screen time. Her next role was as "Helga" in 2 Days in the Valley (1996), which landed her the role of "Tina" in That Thing You Do! (1996). Since then, she has starred in movies like The Devil's Advocate (1997); Mighty Joe Young (1998); The Cider House Rules (1999); The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) and The Italian Job (2003). An important day in her life was February 29th, 2004 when she was awarded with her first Academy Award for her performance in Monster (2003).
      When she was 15 her father attacked her mother, and her mother shot him in self-defense. He died, but her mother was not charged in the incident.
      Appeared nude in the May 1999 issue of Playboy Magazine. The photos had been taken years earlier before she had became famous, and she unsuccessfully tried to prevent the magazine from publishing them.
      Turned down the female lead in Pearl Harbor (2001) to star alongside Keanu Reeves in Sweet November (2001).
      Placed #1 on Beautiful People Internet Poll, narrowly beating Cameron Diaz in #2 and Kate Beckinsale in #3. The photo featured on the site was the famous 'Diving Board' photo.
      Both of her parents were born and raised in South Africa. Her ancestry is largely Afrikaner (Dutch), as well as French (the origin of her surname) and German.

      After winning her Oscar, she returned to great celebrations in her native South Africa, and she even met former South African President Nelson Mandela. When he praised her for putting their country on the map and gave her a hug, Theron broke into tears (she was guest of honor at the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Johannesburg on March 11th 2004).
      In 2004, injured her neck while filming Æon Flux (2005). Fortunately, the injury wasn't serious enough to put her in the hospital, but it did postpone production for several weeks.
      At the 2005 Golden Globes she was sporting a new dark hair color. She is a now a member of the celebrities who have dyed their hair from blonde to brown, or black. They include, among others: Mary-Kate Olsen; Nicky Hilton; Mandy Moore; Renée Zellweger; Christina Aguilera, Melinda Messenger and Ashlee Simpson.
      She was the first person to sign on to be a presenter at the 77th Annual Academy Awards, in 2005.
      Second actress (the first was Kim Basinger) to win an Oscar after appearing naked in Playboy magazine.
      She is the second South African-born person to win an Academy Award. The South African-born cinematographer Ted Moore was the first. South African-born actor Basil Rathbone was the first South African-born actor to be nominated, followed by Cecil Kellaway. Theron was the first South African-born woman to win an Oscar.
      Was listed as a potential nominee on the 2006 Razzie Award nominating ballot. She was listed as a suggestion in the Worst Actress category for her performance in the film Æon Flux (2005). However, she failed to receive a nomination. (Had she gotten the nomination, she would have been the first person to be nominated for both Leading Actress awards at the Oscars, for North Country (2005), and the Razzies.)
      Trained as a ballet dancer at the Joffrey Ballet School in New York City, and performed in both "Swan Lake" and "The Nutcracker". Her dancing career ended after a knee injury.
      One of the first movies she ever went to see at the theater was Splash (1984). She confessed that after watching the movie, she felt jealous of Daryl Hannah and developed a crush on Tom Hanks. She even said to herself that she could have played the role of Madison better than Hannah.
      Shares the same background as actor Daniel Bonjour who also left South Africa as a teenage actor and traveled to Europe and then America. Both their parents are of European background. Also, both actors have found it easier to simply use an American accent in their work.

      [on the revelation that her mother shot and killed her father while he was in a drunken rage, which was ruled self-defense] I was always Mama's girl, and I always felt like her protector.
      Women have conquered the world. And with everything we go through, it's about time we had a female president. I don't think we're that far away, but it should have happened already. I wouldn't be surprised if Hillary Rodham Clinton runs - I really admire her.
      I've always been very proud to be a South African and I've always been very honest to people about that. And whatever I can do in my power I promise you I will do. I don't think it's too much pressure. I think it's our duty as citizens of this country. You don't have to win an Oscar to do something good for your country. We all can do that. If I can be an encouragement for that I'll be glad to be that.
      I'm 50-50 on glamour stuff. I'd rather put on a pair of jeans and get on my Harley and act like a guy.
      I think of myself as a highly sexual creature. I have to use that. I have no choice. I like it. I didn't grow up with a mother telling me what was under my clothes was bad or evil.
      [on the importance of the Toronto Film Festival for smaller films] If people, critics respond to the film there, it starts a nice little wave of chat, which for a movie like North Country (2005) is really important. It's one of those films that travels by word of mouth.
      [on marriage] I'm happy for people who want to get married, but it's not my thing. I'm extremely happy in my relationship and I would love to have kids.
      [on accents] At first I found it really hard using three different English accents: South African, faking the American, faking the accent required by the job. I decided to make it easier for myself and just do one. I haven't lost my culture, just my accent.
      [on bad habits and guilty pleasures] Anything fried I'll take. Are you kidding me? I will fry my shoe and eat it.
      Looks alone won't get you that far. It may get you in the door, but there's always somebody younger, somebody prettier. You have to rely on something else.
      What kind of stories can you tell with glamor? There are very few stories of conflict you can tell, right? I look for good stories; I'm not driven by anything other than good filmmakers and good stories. And then my job as an actor is to service those stories as well as I possibly can. The physical is the last thing that drives me.
      I live a very simple life. I don't have to make those giant movies. I don't have a yacht or a private plane. As long as I can maintain this life, which is pretty low-maintenance and simple, then all of a sudden you don't have to worry about all that stuff. I don't have to take a job to pay a mortgage on a house I can't afford.
      [on a possible biopic of her life] God, I hope not. I've been working harder than anything in my life to try and keep my life sacred. I really don't mind when I'm in front of a camera and playing a character I'm comfortable with . . . but I don't necessarily like the spotlight to be about me - not at all. The idea of sitting in Cannes and watching that . . . ugh. No.
      [on playing unglamorous characters yet posing for glamorous spreads] Well, guess what? I'm a sexual creature. There's nothing wrong with that. Why do we have to be ashamed of being so many different things? Why do we have to be only one thing, a good mother or a hooker? I don't think that what's under my clothes is evil. I'm a woman, I'm feminine. And I like the way I look. And I celebrate that. And I don't make excuses for that.
      People just aren't willing to see conflict, or ugliness or the more flawed side of life through a female character's eyes. I mean, can you imagine a woman playing Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976)? When Robert De Niro does it it's fine, [but] people are very uncomfortable about seeing that through a woman's eyes. We aren't allowed complexity.
      [on the media's reaction to her appearance in In the Valley of Elah (2007) It just bummed me out because I was, "What do you want? Do you want me to play a detective from Albuquerque who's a single mom in a Dior dress?" The way they focused on my appearance, I felt like it hurt [the film] and I was embarrassed because [director] Paul Haggis had worked really hard, and just because I had a ponytail that's what they were talking about.
      I don't believe in charmed lives. I think that tragedy is part of the lesson you learn to lift yourself up, to pick yourself up and to move on.
      [on being congratulated by Nelson Mandela and South African president Thabo Mbeki after winning a Best Actress Oscar for Monster (2003)] I don't think I want to be a pin-up for anything! The people who inspire me are the ones who just live life and live it in a way that's good-natured. Do unto others what you want done unto yourself. It's not that hard. Don't screw people over. Enjoy life, travel, adventure. Enjoy.I try to just live my life in as good and authentic a way as possible. And I just wish people would write about that and the matter-of-fact way that that is, rather than, "On a summer's day, her mother shot her father". It's like I walk around with this badge. I live my life the way I want to live my life. It's like I have chosen this life. I want to be able to go to sleep at night and feel that I'm not haunted and I'm happy and I enjoyed my day in London and that I enjoy my friends and my love, and that if this is all gone tomorrow, like that man who died so horribly in front of me when I was five, that it was good.
      [on her mother shooting her father, who was in a drunken rage, which was ruled self-defense] You know, people drank. Some people drank more, but it was never considered that this might be a problem. It was just the way it was then.
      [on her role in Monster (2003)] I was trying to make the correlation between Aileen Wuornos and her experiences when she was very young. And I was reminded of something that happened to me. I was five years old and we were driving . . . all the cars stopped because a truck had rolled over and was ablaze. The doors were jammed and there was a man trapped inside. In South Africa everybody carries a weapon, and the man begged for someone to shoot him because he didn't want to burn to death. Nobody could get him out of the cab, so somebody shot him. It was horrific, but definitely a moment that made me have a great value for life. Other things in life have taught me not to take a moment for granted.
      I never got offered parts like that, never. And it took a woman, a first-time female director to offer me that role. Paul Haggis [the director of Crash (2004) and In the Valley of Elah (2007)] recently said to me, "You know, often it's the material that will define an actor, but you didn't do that. You defined yourself with what you chose to do". And I thought that was a nice compliment.
      I do like the challenge of finding material that people don't want to risk a lot of money on and that studios don't necessarily jump to go, "Yeah! We want to tell that story." And how could I not after I had done something like Monster (2003)? Everybody wondered how a movie like that could be successful.
      [on her role in Hancock (2008)] I keep myself guessing. I get bored so quickly. I just really liked the material. And the girl was cool. I wasn't ticking any boxes. I just try and do good material and how it gets made is secondary . . . and anyway, it's really nice to get a decent paycheck.
      As you get older, you get wrinkles and your boobs sag. But you get wisdom, too. So it's not all bad!
      [in response to a reporter's question as to which side of the bed she sleeps on] The side that you're not on.
      ponding to a question as to why she doesn't have kids] I actually have seven children no one knows about--in a cave. They can see Russia from their house, too.
      I don't avoid glamorous roles. I played Britt Ekland [in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004)], who is one of the most beautiful women alive. But I don't see so many. You tell me one glamorous role that is in a good movie you have seen in the last ten years. My point is, it's not a case of wanting to be glamorous or not. It's about wanting to tell a good story. And the physical is at the bottom of the list for me. Your job, as an actor, is to be a clean canvas for your director, and you have to tell the story as authentically as possible.
      I don't know if I would be who I am today if I'd grown up in a different country. In our house the news was always on, the newspaper was always on the dining room table and my parents had a real thirst for politics, and that's how I grew up. A lot of my American friends grew up in a different way, and because of what's happened in America in recent years, they are asking questions, playing catch-up. But I can understand that, because they were living in a country that was comfy and cosy. I wasn't. I want to know what is going on. I have an interest in world politics - how can you not when you live on this Earth? I'm just flabbergasted when people don't give a shit.
      I can remember wing up in South Africa] we'd have to travel an hour to the nearest drive-in cinema, and we'd go and never really knew what was playing. But once you got there, it was an hour's drive back, so you may as well watch whatever it was. I was about eight or nine and Fatal Attraction (1987) was playing and Mom didn't want to turn all the way around, so she was like, "Well, this is as good a way for you to learn as any".
      On her mother shooting her father: I don't think you can go through something like that and not kind of walk with it, hand in hand. But you try very hard to move on.
      My mother was an incredible example to me. I can't imagine going through life without her. I think she has influenced who I am, but without intent really. She would always say, 'That's how I feel, but you should figure it out for yourself.' I think of my life now and I realise that the way I was brought up is why I can deal with so much now. I'm responsible for my own actions, my own decisions. So it's a weird one, because she didn't want me to be her, but I think now, at 32, I look at her and I kind of go, 'Wow, I somehow aspire to be you.' I think she really values me being independent and being myself.
      The reason I did North Country (2005) wasn't just because of what the women were going through. I was really fascinated to understand where the men came from. But what those women suffered was appalling. Just appalling. The real lady that this happened to is still in therapy and on medication. When you meet her, you understand that this has taken a real toll on her.
      Look, I can't forget I'm a woman. I love being a woman and I love being feminine, so that will always be part of my work, obviously. But I approach the material with a more humanistic approach. I think that kind of stuff can become over-earnest if you approach it with a big hammer. Personally I've been lucky. Maybe it's the way I was raised, but I know right from wrong and I know wrong when I walk into a room - and if I feel it's wrong, I walk right out again.
      There were a lot of pros to winning the Oscar, but a lot of cons too. Suddenly it all became about transformation. Every movie I did after Monster (2003) was jumped upon as yet another transformation. Even when I only had dirt on my face, like in North Country (2005) it was transformation.
      I do all this work with Guillermo Arriaga on the The Burning Plain (2008) script, we explore all these themes, and then we come on these junkets and it's like: 'So, you don't play a glamorous role again.' Sometimes I just want to look at people and say, 'Have you really thought this through?' You know, how many great stories can you tell in a Dior dress? Or is it because I've done a J'adore perfume ad that I can only be one type of woman? I don't think women are that. We are many things. One day we wake up and we want to put on jeans and T-shirt, and the next day we want to fucking have our hair done. But that doesn't mean that I don't have access to raw emotion.
      I don't know how to say this without sounding strange. But I feel like having this tragedy [her mother shot her father] at such a young age has given me a leg up from other people. Because, man, from 16, I knew the value of life and I knew how quickly it could be taken away. And from that moment on, I made a choice to either swim or to drown, you know?
      People want to think that I am this tortured soul, that my work is drawn only from this one well. And though I would never sit here and say that it didn't mark me, or mould me into the person that I am, my life has had many painful journeys and heartbreaks since my father died, many of which I draw on for my work.
      I think women are way more conflicted than men, and I think we come from a society that's very comfortable with the Madonna-whore complex, you know. We're either really good hookers or really good mothers.
      [on reconnecting with her roots in South Africa] I've gone back several times. The only thing that really stuck with me the first time I went back was walking through the house that I grew up in, and everything seemed so small. It was such a bizarre feeling. I was like, 'My mother made me sleep in a closet'.
      I've never been a fan of labels. And I'm not a big fan of overly justifying bad behavior, or why people are the way they are. I think it's a cop-out. And I don't have a lot of empathy for that.
      I live a very simple life. I don't have to make these giant movies. I don't have a yacht or a private plane. As long as I can maintain this life, which is pretty low-maintenance and simple, then all of a sudden you don't have to worry about all that stuff. It's such a blessed place to be in. I don't have to take a job to pay a mortgage on a house that I can't afford. My life comes first, then my job. I'm incredibly lucky to be in a position where I don't have to work all the time to live.
      It's not like I've been [offered] any great glamorous roles that had great conflict and great story-telling. But I'm not going to be picky, because they're hard to come by. If I sit around waiting for a good, glamorous story to come around, I'm probably never going to work. So if you don't consider my character [in In the Valley of Elah] beautiful, I'm sorry, but that's really me. That's my natural hair color. That's me with very little make-up. There's no prosthetics. That's what I look like. I think we're starting to live in a culture where we're so celebrity-obsessed that we're starting to believe that when we see celebrities, they're supposed to look like they do on magazine covers. But that's about people doing hair and make-up for you, and wearing big gowns. I look for roles involving good stories and good filmmakers. And it's my job as an actor to service those stories as best I possibly can. It's not about how I look physically. Physical's the last thing I think of.
      All of that stuff is really nice. I do have a bit of a guilt - I don't know if it's the African in me - but I'm one person and how much makeup do I need? I have a normal-sized closet. I donate things. I don't have a nature in me to want things in excess. I actually don't like it. A lot of times, I will auction it off and have it go to charity. And my friends benefit a lot. I call it Narnia. When I see a girlfriend and say, 'I like that top,' she's like, 'Narnia, from your closet.'
      I don't really talk about my personal life and I don't really talk about my relationships. I'm not a big partier. I like the simplicity of my life, and I've chosen the kind of life I really want to live. I don't think my life is boring at all.
      There's this kind of idea that someone like me would be horrible with women. That acknowledgement that if you look a certain way, you can't be a girl's girl. I have way deeper relationships with girls than I do with guys. I get along with guys. The women in my life are the ones who move me. It sounds so hokey, but I've been blessed with incredible women in my life.
      I wasn't technically the greatest, but I succeeded and got lead roles because when I died, I died, and when I was spinning into madness, I was spinning into madness.
      It's great fun when you have three people coming to your house, and one's doing your nails, one's doing your hair and one's doing your makeup. Two hours later, you look gorgeous. But that's not my life.
      The people who inspire me are the ones who just live life and live it in a way that's good-natured. Do unto others what you want done unto yourself.
      We all understand situations where it's swim or drown. Sometimes we surprise ourselves when we start swimming and see how well we can do it.
      [on Prometheus (2012) co-star Michael Fassbender] I saw him in Shame (2011), in which he plays a sex addict, and I didn't stop thinking about that film for weeks. No disrespect to the people who were nominated for Oscars, but the fact he wasn't to me was utter bulls**t. I think he's incredible. He's so effortless that I want to punch him! It just seeps out of him.
      I think the reason why female directors are so successful is because they're not just telling women stories. They might be telling stories that affect women but their studies on men are done so well so that they're universal directors. So I really believe this is a talent, and just understanding the human conflict is so good that they can tell any genre, any kind of story, and that's why I think they're doing so well.
      [on being cast in varying types of role] Every time, you start something from scratch. You can't really come into the new job carrying leftovers. But for me it's somewhat easy because I've never worked with two directors that are similar. I've never worked with material that you approached the same way. I think that's what makes it fun and makes it interesting.
      You go through situations that don't work out, and then all of a sudden you have this baby in your hands and you forget about all of that.
      [about her weak teeth, in the 1980s from jaundice] My early childhood was devastating. I had no teeth until I was 11. I had these fangs because I had jaundice, when I was a kid and I was put on so many antibiotics that my teeth rotted. They [dental surgeons] cut them out. So I never had teeth. That was tough, you know, being in school having photos taken while I was pretending I had teeth. It was hideous.

Charlize Theron (General American pronunciation: /ʃɑrˈliːs ˈθɛrən/; Afrikaans pronunciation: [ʃɐrˈlis tron];[2] born 7 August 1975)[3] is a South African and American actress, producer, director, and fashion model. She rose to fame in the late 1990s following roles in the films The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), and The Cider House Rules (1999). Theron received critical acclaim for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster (2003), for which she won the Silver Bear, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Academy Award for Best Actress among several other accolades, becoming the first South African to win an Academy Award in a major acting category. In recent years, she has moved into the field of producing, both in television and film.
She received further Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for her performance in North Country in 2005, and a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance in Young Adult in 2011. In 2012, she appeared in Snow White & the Huntsman and Prometheus, both of which were box office successes. Theron became a U.S. citizen in 2007, while retaining her South African citizenship.
Theron was born in Benoni, in the then-Transvaal Province of South Africa, the only child of Gerda (née Maritz)[4][5] and Charles Theron (born 27 November 1947).[5] Second Boer War figure Danie Theron was her great-great-uncle.[6] Her ancestry includes French, German, and Dutch persons; her French forebears were early Huguenot settlers in South Africa.[6] "Theron" is an Occitan surname (originally spelled Théron) pronounced in Afrikaans as [tɜːron], although she has said that the way she pronounces it in South Africa is [θron].[7] She changed the pronunciation when she moved to the U.S. to give it a more "American" sound.
She grew up on her parents' farm in Benoni, near Johannesburg.[8][9][10] On 21 June 1991, Theron's father, an alcoholic,[10] physically attacked her mother and threatened both her mother and her while drunk; Theron's mother then shot and killed him. The shooting was legally adjudged to have been self-defense and her mother faced no charges.[11]
Theron attended Putfontein Primary School (Laerskool Putfontein), a period she later characterised as not "fitting in".[12] At 13, Theron was sent to boarding school and began her studies at the National School of the Arts in Johannesburg.[10] Although Theron is fluent in English, her first language is Afrikaans.[13][14]
Although seeing herself as a dancer,[15] Theron at 16 won a one-year modeling contract[10] at a local competition in Salerno[15][16] and with her mother moved to Milan, Italy.[17] After Theron spent a year modeling throughout Europe, she and her mother moved to New York City and Miami, Florida.[17] In New York, she attended the Joffrey Ballet School, where she trained as a ballet dancer until a knee injury closed this career path.[15] As Theron recalled in 2008,
I went to New York for three days to model, and then I spent a winter in New York in a friend's windowless basement apartment. I was broke, I was taking class at the Joffrey Ballet, and my knees gave out. I realized I couldn't dance anymore, and I went into a major depression. My mom came over from South Africa and said, "Either you figure out what to do next or you come home, because you can sulk in South Africa."[15]
At 19,[18] Theron flew to Los Angeles, on a one-way ticket her mother bought her, intending now to work in the movie industry.[15] During her early months there, she went to a Hollywood Boulevard bank to cash a check her mother had sent her to help with the rent.[19] When the teller refused to cash it, Theron engaged in a shouting match with him.[10] Upon seeing this, talent agent John Crosby,[19] in line behind her, handed her his business card and subsequently introduced her to casting agents and also an acting school.[19][20] She later fired him as her manager after he kept sending her scripts for films similar to Showgirls and Species.[21] After several months in the city, she was cast in her first film role, a non-speaking role in the direct-to-video film Children of the Corn III (1995).[10] Her first speaking role was a supporting but significant and attention-garnering part as a hitwoman in 2 Days in the Valley (1996).[10] Larger roles in widely released Hollywood films followed, and her career expanded in the late 1990s with box-office successes like The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), and The Cider House Rules (1999).[10] She was on the cover of the January 1999 issue of Vanity Fair as the "White Hot Venus".[22] She also appeared on the cover of the May 1999 issue of Playboy magazine. However, the nude photos inside the issue had been taken several years earlier before she became famous and Theron unsuccessfully sued the magazine for publishing the photos without her consent.[23][24]
She starred in four films in 2000 – Reindeer Games, The Yards, The Legend of Bagger Vance and Men of Honor – and was briefly considered a new It girl. Theron has said of this period in her career that, "I kept finding myself in a place where directors would back me but studios didn't. [I began] a love affair with directors, the ones I really, truly admired. I found myself making really bad movies, too. Reindeer Games was not a good movie, but I did it because I loved John Frankenheimer."[25]
After appearing in other films, Theron starred as serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster (2003).[10] Film critic Roger Ebert called it "one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema".[26] For this role, Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 76th Academy Awards in February 2004,[27] as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Golden Globe Award.[28] She is the first South African to win an Oscar for Best Actress.[29] The Oscar win pushed her to The Hollywood Reporter's 2006 list of highest-paid actresses in Hollywood; earning US$10 million for both her subsequent films, North Country and Aeon Flux, she ranked seventh, behind Halle Berry, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Renée Zellweger, Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.[30] AskMen also named her the number one most desirable woman of 2003.[31]
In 2005, Theron portrayed Rita, Michael Bluth's (Jason Bateman) love interest, on the third season of Fox's critically acclaimed television series Arrested Development.[32] She also received Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award nominations for her role of Britt Ekland in the 2004 HBO film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.[33] On 30 September, Theron received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[29] In the same year, she starred in the financially unsuccessful science fiction thriller Aeon Flux. She also received the 2005 Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female for her voiceover work in the Aeon Flux video game.[34][35]
Theron received Best Actress Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for her lead performance in the drama North Country.[27][28] Ms. magazine also honoured her for this performance with a feature article in its Fall 2005 issue.[36] She was supposed to star in the screen adaption of the short story The Ice at the Bottom of the World by Mark Richard, and it was to be directed by Kimberly Peirce[37] and produced by Theron's company Denver and Delilah Films (Theron's two dog's names). Theron has owned the rights for many years.[38] She was also supposed to star in a movie adaption of the graphic novel Jinx, but neither project has been produced yet.[37]
In 2008, Theron was named the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Woman of the Year.[39] That year she also starred with Will Smith in the superhero film Hancock, and in late 2008 she was asked to be a UN Messenger of Peace by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.[40]
In October 2009, Theron was cast to star in a sequel to the Mad Max films, titled Mad Max: Fury Road.[41][42]
On 4 December 2009, Theron co-presented the draw for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa, accompanied by several other celebrities of South African nationality or ancestry. During rehearsals she drew an Ireland ball instead of France as a joke at the expense of FIFA, referring to Thierry Henry's handball controversy in the play-off match between France and Ireland.[43][44] The stunt alarmed FIFA enough for it to fear she might do it again in front of a live global audience.[45]
Following a three-year hiatus from the big screen, Theron returned to the spotlight in 2011 with Young Adult. Directed by Jason Reitman, the film earned critical acclaim especially for Theron's performance. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and several other high profile awards. Theron played the Wicked Queen in the film Snow White & the Huntsman, which began production in 2011 and was released in 2012.[46]
When I'm figuring out a character, for me it's easy, since once I say yes to something, I become super-obsessed about it – and I have an obsessive nature in general. How I want to play it starts at that moment. It's a very lonely, internal experience. I think about [the character] all the time – I observe things, I see things and file things [in my head], everything geared to what I'm going to do. I'm obsessed with the human condition. You read the script and become obsessed with [a character's] nature, her habits. When the camera rolls, it's time to do my job, to do the honest truth. You can't do that part of the [character-creation] work when you're [in the middle of] making the film. At least I can't.[47]
In 2012, she starred in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Prometheus. On 7 February 2013 it was announced that Theron was cast as Libby Day, the lead character in the film adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel Dark Places. The film is to be directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, and Theron will also have a producer credit.[48]
In 2013 Vulture/NYMag named her the 68th Most Valuable Star in Hollywood saying "We’re just happy that Theron can stay on the list in a year when she didn’t come out with anything ... any actress who’s got that kind of skill, beauty, and ferocity ought to have a permanent place in Hollywood."[49]
Theron has a son, Jackson, whose adoption was announced in March 2012.[50] She lives in Los Angeles.[51] Theron became a naturalised citizen of the United States in May 2007,[52] while retaining her South African citizenship.[53]
In the mid-1990s, Theron had a two-year relationship with actor Craig Bierko.[54][55] From 1997 to 2001, she dated Third Eye Blind frontman Stephan Jenkins.[56] Theron then began a relationship with Irish actor Stuart Townsend, with whom she starred in Trapped (2002) and Head in the Clouds (2004).[56] Theron and Townsend separated in January 2010 after nearly nine years together.[57] As of February 2014[update] she is dating actor Sean Penn.[58]
While filming Aeon Flux in Berlin, Germany, Theron suffered a herniated disc in her neck, caused by a fall while filming a series of back handsprings. This required her to wear a neck brace for a month.[59] In July 2009, Theron was diagnosed with a serious stomach virus, thought to be contracted while travelling outside the United States.[60][61] When filming The Road, Theron injured her vocal cords during the labour screaming scenes.[62]
Having signed a deal with John Galliano in 2004, Theron replaced Estonian model Tiiu Kuik as the spokeswoman in the "J'adore" advertisements by Christian Dior.[63]
From October 2005 to December 2006, Theron earned US$3 million for the use of her image in a worldwide print media advertising campaign for Raymond Weil watches.[64] In February 2006, she and her loan-out corporation were sued by Weil for breach of contract.[64][65] The lawsuit was settled on 4 November 2008.[66]
The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) was created in 2007 by Charlize Theron, Academy Award winning actor and UN Messenger of Peace, in an effort to support African youth in the fight against HIV/AIDS. CTAOP's mission is to help keep African youth safe from HIV/AIDS. The Project is committed to supporting community-engaged organizations that address the key drivers of the disease. Although the geographic scope of CTAOP is Sub-Saharan Africa, the primary concentration has mostly been Charlize's home country of South Africa. CTAOP's approach is based on the belief that community-based organizations on the ground understand the social and structural relationships of their communities better than anyone. By supporting these organizations through grant giving, networking, and spotlighting their work, CTAOP enables communities to mobilize and empower themselves to prevent HIV.[67]
In December 2009, CTAOP and TOMS Shoes partnered to create a limited edition unisex shoe. The shoe was made from vegan materials and inspired by the African baobab tree, the silhouette of which was embroidered on blue and orange canvas. Ten-thousand pairs were given to destitute children, and a portion of the proceeds went to CTAOP.[68]
Theron is involved in women's rights organisations, and has marched in pro-choice rallies.[69] Theron also is a supporter of animal rights and active member of PETA. She appeared in a PETA ad for its anti-fur campaign.[70]
She is a supporter of same-sex marriage and attended a march to support that in Fresno, California, on 30 May 2009.[71] She is a gay rights activist and refuses to get married until same sex marriage is legal in the United States.
I don't want to get married because right now the institution of marriage feels very one-sided, and I want to live in a country where we all have equal rights...
...I think it would be exactly the same if we were married, but for me to go through that kind of ceremony, because I have so many friends who are gays and lesbians who would so badly want to get married, that I wouldn't be able to sleep with myself.[72]
When government starts to tell us who can love and what is good love… I do have a problem with that. I do have a problem with the fact that our government hasn't stepped up enough to make this federal, to make [gay marriage] legal. I think everybody has that right.[73]

=======================================================
A violent childhood compelled her to succeed and when she won an Oscar, Theron knew she'd made it. How did the beautiful blonde shake off the 'girlfriend' tag to become a Monster?
Charlize Theron was born on 7 August 1975 and grew up on a farm outside of Johannesburg. She was named after her father Charles who was of French descent, while her mother Gerda hailed from German stock – but both parents were born and raised in South Africa.Aged six, Theron began ballet lessons and at 12 was sent to a boarding school in Johannesburg, specialising in the arts. Here, Theron stepped up her dance training, studying classical ballet as well as flamenco, Greek and contemporary dance.Back at home though, trouble was brewing. Father Charles had slipped into alcoholism and Theron had come to feel like her mother's protector after Charles started to physically abuse her.In 1991, when Theron was back from school for the weekend and upstairs in her room, the situation came to a head. Charles attacked Gerda once more and she shot him dead (for years Theron told interviewers her father was killed in a car crash). The incident was viewed as self-defence and therefore Gerda didn’t serve any time in prison.Keen to move on, Gerda encouraged Theron to enter a Johannesburg modelling contest. Theron won the contest and flew to Italy to represent South Africa at the International New Model Today competition. She won again and modelling work came flooding in. Soon she was living on her own in Milan, travelling to jobs all over Europe.After a year, Theron moved to New York to study at the Joffrey Ballet School, financing herself by modelling in her spare time. Sadly, her prima ballerina dreams turned to dust when her knee 'blew out' in class, forcing her into premature retirement.In 1994, Theron found herself living in a cheap hotel, broke and eating bread stolen from restaurants. Fate would play its card though when, while attempting to cash a much-needed $500 donation from her mother, the cashier refused as it was an out-of-state cheque. Theron went ballistic, giving the cashier and bank staff a taster of her South African fieriness.Unbeknown to her, Theron's blast had been witnessed by John Crosby, a long-time talent manager then representing John Hurt and Rene Russo. He immediately offered to represent her. Crosby organised acting classes and within months, Theron had made her acting debut in 'Children of the Corn III'.By 1997, Theron had already established a reputation as one of the most promising young actresses on the scene, appearing in a few TV series as well as an ad for Martini. Her silver screen debut was in Jonathan Lynn's 'Trial And Error'. Lynn's previous hit film 'My Cousin Vinny' had earned an unexpected Oscar for Marisa Tomei.
Now Theron was entering the major league. 'The Devil's Advocate' (1997), also starring Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves, saw Theron act her socks off as Reeves' suicidal wife.1998 saw Theron take a brief but memorable part in Woody Allen's 'Celebrity', followed by a lead part in a Disney remake of 'Mighty Joe Young'. The film was a success and, slowly, Theron's profile was rising among fans and critics alike.In Hollywood, Theron was now very much in demand. 1999 began with 'The Astronaut's Wife', alongside Johnny Depp. Next, Theron featured in Lasse Hallstrom's 'The Cider House Rules' - the film brought in well-earned box office ratings and Theron was able to demonstrate a wider dimension to her acting abilities.The Millennium began as a busy year for Theron, yet none of the four films she starred in proved a big enough success to warrant any significant coverage for her. 'Reindeer Games' starring Ben Affleck and 'The Yards' featuring Mark Wahlberg were minor hits. 'Men of Honour', in which she starred as Robert De Niro's alcoholic wife, drew a better audience reaction.By the start of 2001, Theron's career was at a point whereby her earning potential was far greater than it once had been, yet her status as an A-list actor wasn't quite sealed. 'Sweet November' was a box office flop, earning Theron a Razzie nomination, and signifying the beginning of a nose-dive in her acting credibility. A brief cameo in '15 Minutes' followed, reuniting Theron with Robert De Niro, and she was also reunited with Woody Allen in the period drama, 'The Curse of the Jade Scorpion'.'Trapped' in 2001 was significant to Theron for more than professional reasons as it was here that she starred alongside the actor Stuart Townsend, whom she started dating shortly afterwards.Next came 'Waking Up In Reno' (2002), an odd road-trip comedy about two southern couples with Billy Bob Thornton playing a car dealer who cheats on his wife (played by Natasha Richardson) with Theron. She had the opportunity to once again showcase her comic abilities but the film failed to propel her to the forefront of the plot.The big budget remake of 'The Italian Job' in 2003 saw Theron credited beside Mark Wahlberg again, but the film didn't take audiences by storm and was considered a poor reflection of the 1969 original.
Theron's turn in 'The Devil's Advocate' was to prove more life-changing then she'd ever anticipated back in 1997, when writer and director Patty Jenkins approached her after seeing the film. Theron's willingness to play a part that involved being filmed with her nose openly running was enough to convince Jenkins she was right to star in 'Monster', a film she was writing about Aileen Wuornos, America's first female serial killer.Theron grabbed the opportunity to play Wuornos and, in gaining nearly three stone, made herself virtually unrecognisable. She threw herself into the part by studying Nick Broomfield's 1992 documentary 'Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer', and nailed all of Wuornos's ticks and body movements to a tee. The hard work finally paid off when she collected an Oscar and a Golden Globe for the role.Taking a break from the immense time and dedication that had gone into 'Monster', Theron took a part as far from Aileen Wuornos as possible, playing Britt Ekland in 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers' (2004) alongside Geoffrey Rush.Since the success of 'Monster', Theron has taken comparatively less demanding roles to date and can be said to be concentrating a little more on her personal life rather than a back-to-back film schedule.
'Aeon Flux' in 2005 was Theron's most high-profile part since her Oscar win but sadly, the critics and audience alike weren't convinced by the big screen adaptation of the 1995 MTV cartoon and subsequently, Theron failed to live-up to her Academy Award profile.However, the actress received a more favourable response from critics later that year when she starred in the drama 'Home Country'. The star received a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination for the role. In 2009, Theron co-presented the 2010 FIFA World Cup draw in Cape Town. Showing her sense of humour, Theron jokingly drew an Ireland ball instead of France during rehearsals.Since then she has starred in the superhero parody 'Hancock' with Will Smith in 2008, 'The Burning Plain' (2008) and 'The Road' in 2009.In January 2010, it was revealed that she had split from her partner of almost ten years, Irish actor Stuart Townsend. After this she took a year out from acting before returning in one of 2012's biggest films 'Prometheus' - the Ridley Scott-directed 'prequel' to 'Alien'. She also played the villain in 'Snow White and The Huntsman' with Kristen Stewart. The twisted, dark take on the fairy tale has already proved such a success that a second one will be made.Earlier this year, Theron debuted a shocking new look - a bald head – which it turns out is for her latest role. In 2013, she will appear in the remake of 'Mad Max: Fury Road' with Tom Hardy in the main male role. She is also rumoured to be appearing in 'Murder Mystery' next year, as well as 'Hancock 2' and 'Two Eyes Staring', which as yet have no release dates.As well as acting and modelling, Theron has been involved in charity work over the years and supports a number of organisations including Democracy Now! and animal rights group PETA.In addition, she supports gay marriage and took part in a march for the issue in California in 2009.Despite Theron splitting from Townsend after nearly nine years together in 2010, her personal life has improved with the adoption of her son Jackson. The adoption was formalised and announced in March 2012. As of February 2014, she has been dating the actor Sean Penn.

"But it's fun." 1997October 17Devil of a TimeTheron appears in a breakthrough role as Keanu Reeves' wife in The Devil's Advocate. "She was just too good looking for the role," director Taylor Hackford tells EW. "She read and knocked me out but was blonde and tall and sexy, so I wasn't sure she was right." Theron takes up the gauntlet: "When he told me that, I went back in with no makeup and dirty hair; I read for it three times. I f------ won this part fair and square." DecemberSemi-Charmed LifeOn vacation with her family in Hawaii over Christmas, Theron meets Third Eye Blind singer Stephan Jenkins after a show and the two begin dating.

Theron tells PEOPLE, "Once I tapped into the emotional side of how she led her life, the physical stuff just happened naturally."

 Video, Charlize Theron, Charlize Theron Childhood Home, Charlize Theron Childhood Home Murder, Charlize Theron Mother Killed Father, Charlize Theron Mother Killed Father Self Defense,
At the age of 15, the actress witnessed her mother, Gerda Maritz, shoot and kill her abusive, alcoholic father, Charles Theron, while acting in self-defense. Now, more than two decades later the home is once again the site of a brutal death. 
The home's owner, Barry Newland, was reportedly tortured and murdered inside the home in Benoni, near Johannesburg, South Africa, on Sept. 5, by five men who broke into his home, according to The Daily Mail. 
The robbers were let in to Newland's home by his girlfriend, after they pretended to be interested in viewing her car, which was up for sale. His girlfriend left, and the gang waited for him to arrive home. Police told South African newspaper Independent News that the robbers forced Newland inside the bathroom, tied up his hands and feet and placed a plastic bag over his head, and left him to suffocate. Police also say the man was tortured, as his body suffered burns from  cigarettes and a clothes iron. 
The property is once again marred by tragedy, and Theron refused to talk about the horror she witnessed for years, admitting that she used to lie and say her father died in a car crash, rather than rehash her painful past. 
It was only in 2004 that the Oscar-winning actress opened by to ABC News, telling Diane Sawyer that her father and uncle returned home after a night of drinking, and she had been warned by her aunt that he was "agitated." 
According to her mother's testimony, when her father arrived home he began shooting his gun, first at the locked gate at the family home, then through the kitchen door, and then he began banging on Charlize's door, and yelled, "Tonight I'm going to kill you both with the shotgun." 
The actress's father then fired his gun into her room, and that's when her mother grabbed her own handgun and shot and killed her husband and wounded his brother. 
Though her father was dead, Charlize said she knew her mother had no other choice. "I know what happened," she told Sawyer. "And I know that if my daughter was in the same situation, I would do the same thing."
"My mother is amazing, and I know all daughters or children will say this, it sounds very biased, but she is very unique. She's saved my life many times," she said. 
"It was the great tragedy of my life, I think what follows is ... you have to find where you want yourself to be, and how you want people to see you in this world, I had a parent who led me through the grief, shock and anger going through all of the emotional things that you do when you -- when something like this happens to you," she told Morgan. "But really kind of guided me towards not being a victim and not going through my life feeling victimized. You know, I'm incredibly saddened by that night and saddened by the event ... [but] no, it doesn't haunt me. No, it doesn't haunt me at all. I'm completely at peace."
Mysterious Hollywood Deaths -- Natalie WoodThirty years following her death, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reopened the Natalie Wood case on Nov. 17, 2011, claiming officials received credible new information. The original investigation concluded that Wood, 43, accidentally drowned while yachting off the coast of California with husband Robert Wagner and their guest Christopher Walken. 
But the boat's captain Dennis Davern claims he heard the Oscar-nominated actress fighting on the deck with Wagner. Shortly thereafter, no one could locate Wood. Davern claims Wagner impeded their search for Wood by refusing to turn on lights or call for help. Wood's body was found the morning of Nov. 29, 1981 on Santa Catalina island, about a mile from the yacht.
Anna Nicole SmithAnna Nicole Smith, the rags-to-riches <em>Playboy</em> Playmate, was 26 years old when she married 89-year-old wheelchair-bound oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall. For years, she was a tabloid sensation and a realty TV star. After Marshall's death, a lengthy court battle over Marshall's inheritance proved more lurid, draining and outlandish than any Hollywood script, eventually reaching the Supreme Court in September 2010 -- not that Smith would live to see its outcome.
On Sept. 7, 2006, while on vacation in the Bahamas, Smith gave birth to her daughter Dannielynn. Three days later, Smith's 20-year-old son Daniel Smith died in the same hospital, allegedly from a prescription drug overdose. Soon after, a distraught Smith married long-time friend and lawyer (and listed father on daughter Dannielynn's birth certificate) Howard K. Stern. Five months later, Smith was found dead in a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florido from a lethal "combined drug intoxication."Notorious B.I.G.Immortalized by friend P. Diddy's 2009 biopic, "Notorious," Biggie Smalls, née Christopher George Latore Wallace, dominated a rapidly growing hip-hop scene in the early '90s and blew through the roof with hits like "Juicy" and "Big Poppa." He also found himself at the center of an increasingly tense bi-coastal rivalry that pitted Tupac Shakur on the West Coast against Wallace, Sean Combs (later P. Diddy) and Uptown Records' founder Andrew Harrel on the East Coast. 
Wallace was shot in the chest four times early in the morning on March 9,1997, when a black Chevrolet Impala SS pulled up to Wallace's car in Los Angeles and its driver shot through the window. Wallace was pronounced dead a short while later at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; many consider his death an act of revenge for the mysterious killing of Shakur in 1996 . Wallace's murder case remains unsolved.Roscoe 'Fatty' ArbuckleSilent film star Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle became one of the most famous men in America throughout the 1910s, starring in 37 films with everyone from Charlie Chaplin to Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. (He is credited with discovering Lloyd and Bob Hope, while also mentoring Chaplin.)
In 1921, Arbuckle signed a then-record deal with Paramount worth $1 million. To celebrate, he threw a party over Labor Day at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. An actress named Virgina Rappe became ill at the party; she died four days later, and Arbuckle was accused of raping and accidentally killing her. Following three trials, Arbuckle was finally cleared of Rappe's death, but by then the damage had been done: his films were banned for short period of time, and he couldn't get work even after the ban lifted. Arbuckle returned in 1932 and later signed a contract with Warner Bros. to appear in feature-length comedies. "This is the best day of my life," he was quoted as saying. Arbuckle died that night in his sleep after suffering a heart attack; he was 46.
As for Rappe, she died from a ruptured bladder, which may have been caused from a botched abortion she had days before the Labor Day party.Bruce LeeOn July 20, 1973, martial arts star Bruce Lee, 32, died as the result of an apparent allergic reaction to Equagesic, a painkiller. According to the coroner's report, Lee died "by misadventure."
He did suffer from seizures -- one happening just a month before his death -- but popular urban legends persist that Lee was murdered by triads, a curse on his family and/or the delayed reaction from Dim Mak strike (called the "Touch of Death").
<blockquote><strong>CORRECTION: </strong>We previously stated Lee died in 1970, when he died in 1973. We have updated this slide with the correct date and we regret the error.</blockquote>Thomas H. InceKnown as "The Father of the Western," Thomas Ince was a famed silent film actor, producer, writer and director in the 1910s and early 1920s. On Nov. 15, 1924, on the yacht of William Randolph Hearst, Ince fell ill and was returned to shore.  
He succumbed to heart failure, on Nov. 19, but in the newspaper that evening it was reported that Ince was shot on Hearst's yacht.
So, what possibly happened? In one version of events, Hearst allegedly walked in on Marion Davies -- whom he was in love with -- and Charlie Chaplin in a compromising position. During the ensuing struggle, Ince arrived and was accidentally shot. Another theory posits that Hearst shot Ince thinking he was Chaplin. 
The Peter Bogdanovich-directed film 'The Cat's Meow' with Kirsten Dunst focused on Ince's mysterious death.
<strong>Correction:</strong> An earlier version  of this article stated that Ince died on Nov. 15. He died on Nov. 19. Marilyn MonroeOn Aug. 5, 1962, 36-year-old Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her home, after overdosing on barbiturates. The coroner's report listed Monroe's death as probable suicide, but many -- including the first LAPD officer to the scene -- believe she was murdered.
But skeptics say there was no trace of drugs in Monroe's stomach, meaning she didn't swallow the drugs. They also say she was covered in bruises, including a major one on her hip. The toxicologist on the case wanted to examine her to understand how the drugs got into her system, but the initial examination destroyed organs.
Another suspicious sign was revealed that Monroe had enough chemicals in her system to kill 10 people, but intravenous injection was ruled out by examiners.
At the time of her death, Monroe was allegedly involved in a relationship with John F. Kennedy, and perhaps his brother, Robert. FBI files released in 2006 showed that Monroe was considered a security risk after cavorting with known communists during a vacation in Mexico.George ReevesIn 1951, George Reeves became Superman on television. It was the biggest role of his career, and the one that sank it as well: Reeves could never escape the shadow of playing Superman -- he was reportedly cut out of 'From Here to Eternity' after test audiences shouted, "There's Superman!" at the screen -- and, on June 16, 1959, killed himself because of depression over his career.
Or maybe he didn't. While the official cause of death is suicide -- Reeves was found laying naked on his bed, face up, with a gun between his feet on the floor -- many believe he was the victim of an accidental shooting or murder. It was rumored that George's former girlfriend, Toni Mannix, ordered a hit on him after he broke up with her. Mannix died from Alzheimer's disease in 1983, but in 1999, Los Angeles publicist Edward Lozzi said that Mannix confessed to him that she told a priest she was responsible for Reeves's murder.
In 2006, a film about Reeves life and death called 'Hollywoodland' was released. Ben Affleck played the doomed SupermanThelma ToddBetween 1926 and 1935, Thelma Todd appeared in over 120 films, including the Marx Brothers' 'Horse Feathers' and 'Monkey Business.' On Dec. 16, 1935, Todd was found dead in the garage of actress Jewel Carmen, the former wife of Todd's lover and business partner. The cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning.
Police found that Todd had spent the night before her death at a popular Hollywood restaurant, where she had an argument with her ex-husband; she then retreated to Carmen's home, which was a block away from a restaurant that she owned.
Whether foul play was involved in the death remains up for debate. Some believe Todd was targeted for extortion, while others wonder if she was locked inside the garage by a murderer. Blood was found on her head and dress, leading some to believe she was knocked unconscious before being exposed to the gas. Complicating matters? Todd's ex-husband was murdered two years later.O.J. SimpsonOn June 13, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were found murdered at Brown Simpson's home. Evidence at the scene pointed to Nicole's ex-husband, O.J. Simpson, as the prime suspect in their murders. On June 17, 1994, Simpson, a Hall of Fame football player and actor, was set to turn himself in, but he tried to escape with friend Al Cowlings in the infamous "Ford Bronco Chase." Simpson was eventually caught and at his trial, pleaded not guilty to killing his ex-wife and Goldman.
Simpson was found not guilty of the murders on Oct. 3, 1995, but later he was found liable for the wrongful death of Ron Goldman in a civil case which forced Simpson to pay the family $33.5 million in damages. He's currently serving 33 years in prison for kidnapping and armed robbery after breaking into a Las Vegas hotel room to steal memorabilia. Simpson is eligible for parole in 2017, when he'll likely continue to search for the real killers of Nicole and Ron.Elizabeth ShortElizabeth Short, an aspiring actor, became known as Black Dahlia in 1947 after she was found murdered, her body naked and severed in two, in a vacant lot in Hollywood, California. Bob CraneThe 'Hogan's Hero' star was murdered on June 29, 1978, allegedly bludgeoned to death with what might have been a camera tripod. Crane had a voracious sexual appetite and often filmed his escapades with the help of a man named John Henry Carpenter, who police suspected in Crane's death.
No charges were filed against Carpenter until 1990, but Carpenter was acquitted because of a lack of evidence. The murder remains unsolved, but authorities believe Carpenter was the killer. He died in 1998.Tupac ShakurRapper and actor Tupac Shakur was killed on Sept. 9, 1996 in Las Vegas after attending the Mike Tyson vs. Bruce Seldon boxing match. Video surveillance from the MGM Grand showed Shakur and his entourage fighting with an alleged Crips gang member. 
Later, as a passenger en route to a Vegas club, Shakur was killed by a shooter in a car that pulled alongside him. No one has been charged in Shakur's death, but theories contend it had to do possibly with the fight earlier that night or a long-simmering feud with East Coast rapper Notorious B.I.G.
Bobby FullerOn July 18, 1966, Bobby Fuller, who sang "I Fought The Law," was found dead in a car parked outside his Hollywood home. An autopsy report stated that Fuller's face, chest, and side were covered in hemorrhages likely caused by gasoline vapors and heat. The coroner checked "accident" and "suicide" as causes of death. Those checks, however, were accompanied by question marks, leading some to believe that Fuller was actually murdered.Lana Clarkson B-movie actress Lana Clarkson was killed by Phil Spector in the music producer's California mansion on Feb. 3, 2003. They had met in the House of Blues earlier that night and Clarkson was killed by a gunshot to the face. Spector denied the murder charges, claiming her death was accidental and that she had "kissed the gun." A judge declared a mistrial when a jury couldn't reach a verdict, but another jury found Spector guilty of second-degree murder in 2009. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison. David CarradineOn June 4, 2009, David Carradine was found dead in a hotel room in central Bangkok, Thailand, where he was shooting his latest film "Stretch." Speculation pointed to death by suicide, given that police found Carradine naked and hanging by a rope in the room's closet. However, two autopsies later claimed that the death was not a suicide, leading many to accept the theory that Carradine died from accidental suffocation during autoerotic asphyxiation, a pleasure that his ex-wives claimed he enjoyed. Grace KellyGrace Kelly was an American movie star who married Monaco's Prince Rainier III in 1956, raising her profile as she became a royal.  She died in 1982 while driving with her daughter in France, apparently suffering a stroke while in the driver seat on a mountainous road. Her daughter survived, but suffered serious injuries. Brandon LeeOn March 31, 1993, Brandon Lee died after being shot by actor Michael Massee on the set of his latest film, "The Crow." The fatal wound, which struck Lee's abdomen, was fired from a gun that was hastily rigged with improperly constructed dummy rounds and used without approval from the film's hired weapons coordinator, who had been dismissed early that night. The death was ruled accidental and no charges were filed. 
<strong>Correction: </strong>An earlier version of this article stated that an unknown person shot Lee, however it was actor Michael Massee who fired the gun. Kirsty MacCollEnglish musician Kirsty MacColl, well-known for writing hits in the 1980s like "They Don't Know" for Tracy Ullman, died at age 41 in a Mexican boating accident on Dec. 18, 2000.  While diving at a reef near Cozumel, a speedboat zipped through waters towards her sons. In an effort to save them, MacColl was hit by the boat and nearly cut in half by the propeller. The boat that killed her was owned by Mexican supermarket mogul Guillermo González Nova, who was on board with family and a crew member José Cen Yam. Cen Yam claimed he piloted the boat, leading to a conviction and small fine. But MacColl's boyfriend said Nove was at the helm and critics believe Cen Yam took the fall for the wealthy patriarch. Brittany MurphyMost knew her as Alicia Silverstone's chirpy, scene-stealing sidekick in "Clueless," but Brittany Murphy stood at the brink of a promising Hollywood career that included a plum role in the Eminem film "8 Mile" and a public romance with her "Just Married" co-star Ashton Kutcher. But things spun out of control for Murphy, who was appearing increasingly more frail in her later years. On Dec. 20, 2009, the Los Angeles Fire Department arrived at Murphy's home to find the 32-year-old actress unconscious. Murphy was pronounced dead on arrival at the Cedars-Sinai Medicinal Center after going into cardiac arrest. Though the primary cause of death was declared as pneumonia, many speculated that over-the-counter and prescription medications were to blame. Husband Simon Monjack died just five months later, also from pneumonia.
Corey HaimEighties teen heartthrob Corey Haim passed away unexpectedly at the age of 39 in the spring of 2010. 
The actor -- whose Hollywood career as a youngster included roles in films like "Lost Boys" and "License to Drive" -- had publicly struggled with prescription drug abuse and made news when he claimed he had been sexually abused at age 14 by an acquaintance of his then-best friend Corey Feldman. 
Haim got attention again in 2008 when he ran an advertisement in VARIETY stating he was ready to work and was serious about a comeback. But Haim became destitute and increasingly troubled. In March 2010, his mother called the police in a frantic message that leaked online: "Oh my God. I think my son is dead" before administering CPR. Haim's death was later said to be due to pneumonia and a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs.Andy KaufmanIn 1984, the comedy world lost one of it's finest entertainers -- or at least they think they did. Known for his elaborate stunts and ability to toy with an audience's emotions, Andy Kaufman and his death were surrounded by mystery as the 35-year-old star passed away from an undisclosed illness. Kaufman claimed that if he were to fake his own death, he would return 20 years later, which would have been in 2004.Michael JacksonThe presence of multiple anti-anxiety medications and the general anesthetic Propofol in Jackson's system prompted a murder investigation into the pop icon's June 25, 2009 death. While some say that Jackson was heavily addicted to the pain medicines, a court convicted Jackson's personal physician, Conrad Murray, of involuntary manslaughter on Nov. 7, 2011, for administering the lethal dose. Johnny StompanatoOn April 4, 1958, underworld bodyguard Johnny Stompanato was stabbed to death outside the Beverly Hills home of his girlfriend actress Lana Turner. While Cheryl Craine, Turner's then teenage daughter, claimed that she stabbed "Handsome Harry" while defending her mother, skeptics have argued that it was in fact Turner who killed Stompanato, only to place the blame on her daughter who she knew would face minimal consequences. Heath LedgerHeath Ledger, 28, passed away on a chilly January afternoon in 2008, having just completed filming the role of a lifetime -- his brilliant turn as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" -- vaulting his career to new heights.
Just two years after his Oscar-nominated performance in "Brokeback Mountain," Ledger's body was found naked and not breathing by his masseuse. His death was deemed accidental by the Chief Medical Examiner of New York. They wrote in a statement: "We have concluded that the manner of his death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications."Bonny Lee BakleyOn May 4, 2001, after enjoying an Italian dinner at Vitello's Restaurant with her celebrity husband, Robert Blake, Bonnie Lee Bakley was shot in the head while seated in a car around the corner from the eatery. Blake, the star of TV's "Baretta" in the 1970s, claimed that when the shots were fired he was retrieving his own gun from the restaurant, which he carried for protection. The gun he admitted carrying didn't match the bullet that killed Bakley, but critics contended he hired a hit man to blast her. 
Blake was acquitted of his wife's murder in 2005, but was later found responsible in a civil case for causing her death. His defense team suggested many people wanted to Bakley dead, including Marlon Brando's son. Bakley was on probation for fraud when she married Blake. Michael HutchenceOn Nov. 22, 1997, Australian musician and actor Michael Hutchence was discovered dead in Room 524 of Double Bay, Sydney's Ritz-Carlton hotel. A coroner who found alcohol and drugs later determined the incident to be death by suicide, but years later, friend Paula Yates came out claiming the star's death was possibly an accidental suffocation brought on by autoerotic asphyxiation.Jeff BuckleyOnly 31 and with a devoted cult following, Jeff Buckley produced only one recorded studio album but made a huge impact as a musician and artist. His band's album, "Grace," was released in 1994 and included a stunning cover of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," which Rolling Stone deemed one of "The 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time." 
In May 29, 1997, Buckley -- a fixture in downtown New York's music scene -- was in Memphis, where he went swimming in the Wolf River Harbor, and disappeared. According to reports, he was familiar with the river, fully clothed, and in good spirits when entering the river, though he did not return. On June 4th, his body was spotted and his death subsequently ruled an accident. A statement from the Buckley estate officially claiming it was "not 'mysterious,' related to drugs, alcohol or suicide. We have a police report, a medical examiner's report, and an eye witness to prove that it was an accidental drowning."
