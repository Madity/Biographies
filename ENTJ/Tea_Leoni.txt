          Elizabeth Téa Pantaleoni was born in New York, February 25, 1966. Her father, Anthony Pantaleoni, was a corporate lawyer and her mother, Emily Patterson, was a dietitian and nutritionist. She attended but did not complete studies at Sarah Lawrence College. She started out in acting as Lisa DiNapoli in Santa Barbara (1984) in 1989 and followed up with small roles in Switch (1991) and A League of Their Own (1992).In 1992 she starred in the short-lived sitcom Flying Blind (1992). In 1994 she appeared in Wyatt Earp (1994) opposite Kevin Costner and The Counterfeit Contessa (1994) opposite D.W. Moffett. In 1995 she starred opposite Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in the popular film Bad Boys (1995). She also had a guest appearance on Frasier (1993) that same year.She appeared in many successful films after that, such as Flirting with Disaster (1996), Deep Impact (1998), The Family Man (2000), Spanglish (2004), You Kill Me (2007) and most recently, she starred in the film Ghost Town (2008) opposite Greg Kinnear.Tea was married to television commercial producer Neil Joseph Tardio Jr. from 1991 to 1995. In 1997 she married actor David Duchovny, with whom she has two children: Daughter Madelaine West Duchovny (born April 24, 1999) and Son Kyd Miller Duchovny (born June 15, 2002).
      Auditioned for a Charlie's Angels (1976) remake role (as a dare) and got the part. A writer's strike in Hollywood meant the series was never made, but the pre-publicity was enough to get Tea noticed.
      Her character in Deep Impact (1998) breaks the story on a comet which is going to hit the Earth and her character on The Naked Truth (1995) works for "The Comet".
      Her Polish paternal grandparents were musician Jozef and film actress Helenka Adamowska. Her grandmother was related to composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski and she was among those who helped found UNICEF.
      Gave birth to second child, 7lb. 10-oz. boy, Kyd Miller Duchovny, in Los Angeles, 15 June 2002.
      Planned on majoring in anthropology and/or psychology, but dropped out of college at age 20 to do background modeling'.
      Was going to be one of the new Charlie's Angels in the proposed "Angels '88", along with Claire Yarlett, but the series never got off the ground.
      Her grandmother, Helenka Adamowska Pantaleoni, co-founded what would become the US Fund for UNICEF in 1947 and served as its President for 25 years. Téa, herself, has served as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF since 2001.
      Calls her children West and Miller. It is tradition in their family to use the middle names as a first name.
      Went to Oahu to help search for her cousin, Tim Pantaleoni, in summer 1995. He mysteriously vanished while hiking and to this day has never been found.
      Téa's paternal grandfather was of half Italian and half English and German descent, and Téa's paternal grandmother was the daughter of Polish parents. Téa's Southern-born mother had English and Scots-Irish ancestry.
      She has inherited the stage wardrobe of Sonny Bono. They are a perfect fit requiring no alterations. She wore a glittered suite once owned by Sony Bono on the The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (2005) broadcast on December 22, 2007. She demonstrated that the suits have Velcro fasteners to make it easier to quickly change outfits.
      Her husband David Duchovny called her for his "Phone a Friend" lifeline when he appeared on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (1999). When she couldn't offer him any help in regards to the question, she simply told him; "You're screwed, honey".
      Appears in A League of Their Own (1992), with Geena Davis. Her husband, David Duchovny, played Davis's ex-husband, Jeff Goldblum, on Saturday Night Live (1975).
      On October 15, 2008, Leoni and Duchovny confirmed that they had been separated for several months after Duchovny's much publicized sexual addiction. The couple publicly reconciled after Duchovny's rehab period and were seen frequently together, but on June 29, 2011, it was reported the couple had again separated.
      Raised on Manhattan's Upper East Side and sent to exclusive all-girls Brearley School and The Putney School, a progressive boarding school in Vermont. She graduated from Putney in 1984 with the intent on studying anthropology and psychology.
      Was accepted to Sarah Lawrence College but dropped out after her freshman year to travel through Italy and Japan. It was following her travels that she ended up in Boston and, on a friend's dare, entered a local casting call for a new TV series to be called "Angels '88," a campy take on "Charley's Angels". With no experience, she won the lead role but the series never materialized.
      She and Duchovny appeared together on TV only once, when Tea played herself on the 2000 The X Files (1993) episode, The X Files: Hollywood A.D. (2000).
      David. The best thing about marriage is David's sense of humor. (When asked what is the best thing about marriage to David Duchovny).
      "Not to sound like a whore, but I've been with...I've worked with...some very attractive men. Nicolas Cage...Al Pacino...Ben Stiller...and Woody Allen".
      "I love tennis. I love very aggressive tennis, and I think I'm quite good. Golf, well, of course you can drink beer when you play that, but I take it pretty seriously, and I'm quite good at that. And I'm a good swimmer, and I used to compete in windsurfing" (on the challenge of playing an athlete in Spanglish (2004)).
      We have this incredible cast with Billy Bob Thornton, who is maybe my new favorite person in the world.
      I think getting over opening night, his first opening night of his life, was a huge milestone. And he did it with such grace and flying colors. I'm very proud of him. (about husband David Duchovny's off-Broadway debut).
      Hollywood means work and getting yourself out there, and for a while I pooh-poohed that idea. My ego still doesn't get stroked by fame. But I've been guided by people who have told me if you aren't out there, then studios and producers are less likely to pull you in to the projects you might want to do.

Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy lead an all-star cast in Tower Heist, a comedy caper about working stiffs who seek revenge on the Wall Street swindler who stiffed them. After the workers at a luxury Central Park condominium discover the penthouse billionaire has stolen their retirement, they plot the ultimate revenge: a heist to reclaim what he took from them.
Queens native Josh Kovacs (Stiller) has managed one of the most luxurious and well-secured residences in New York City for more than a decade. Under his watchful eye, nothing goes undetected. In the swankiest unit atop Josh's building, Wall Street titan Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is under house arrest after being caught stealing two billion from his investors. The hardest hit among those he defrauded? The tower staffers whose pensions he was entrusted to manage.
With only days before Arthur gets away with the perfect crime, Josh's crew turns to petty crook Slide (Murphy) to plan the nearly impossible to steal what they are sure is hidden in Arthur's guarded condo. Though amateurs, these rookie thieves know the building better than anyone. Turns out they've been casing the place for years, they just didn't know it.

                Tea has starred in blockbuster features like Bad Boys and Deep Impact, but she's probably best known as Nora Wilde in the '90s hit sitcom, The Naked Truth.            
                Tea, pronounced "Tay-uh," means "goddess" in Italian, while Leoni means "lions" in the same language, but we'll just alter that slightly to signify "lioness." The goddess lioness that is Tea Leoni is a lean and femininely muscular sex kitten with a pair of sensationally long legs and a sexy midriff. She did a fair bit of athletic modeling before she hit it big as an actress, and still today, after having had two children, the lovely Mrs. Duchovny could easily pull off a sporty 'n' sexy photo shoot.            
                Before she made it as an actress, Tea Leoni's work as a model found her on the cover of magazines, although that was just about the height of her fame in that milieu. Leoni reached the zenith of her fame in the latter half of the '90s, when she starred as Nora Wilde in the hit sitcom The Naked Truth, scored roles in the blockbuster films Bad Boys and Deep Impact, and wed David Duchovny, one of the hottest actors from one of television's hottest shows.  Tea has worked with some top filmmakers, including James L. Brooks and Woody Allen, and while she's never received any major acting prizes or nominations, her work has been recognized by lesser industry committees. She was twice nominated as Favorite Actress for the Blockbuster Entertainment Award: in 1999, she received a nod in the Sci-Fi category for Deep Impact, and in 2000, she was nominated for her work in The Family Man in the Comedy/Romance division. She failed to win those prizes, but later picked up a Saturn Award in 2001 for Best Actress in the fantasy film, The Family Man.            
                Tea Leoni was born Elizabeth Tea Pantaleoni on February 25, 1966, in New York City. Her father Anthony was a corporate lawyer, while her mother Emily was a professional nutritionist. She went to Brearley, a prominent private all-girls school on New York City's Upper East Side, graduated from a boarding school in Putney, Vermont, and then attended Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied anthropology and psychology.     Leoni decided to take a break from her collegial studies to experience other parts of the world. Her journey took her to Italy to discover her Italian roots, to Japan, where she worked as an athletic model and taught businessmen how to relate to American women, and finally the isle of St. Croix, where she worked on a commercial sailboat as a crew hand.   tea leoni in santa barbara  It was during her travels that Leoni's interest in acting developed, and while living in Boston, she auditioned for a role in Angels '88, a Charlie's Angels spin-off (apparently she did it on a dare). Tea won the part, and while that show never actually aired due to a writers' strike, she landed a gig as a replacement for the Lisa DiNapoli character on the television series Santa Barbara in 1989.   In 1991, Leoni made her big-screen debut playing Connie -- the "Dream Girl" -- in the Blake Edwards comedy Switch. A small part in the film A League of Their Own followed in 1992, the same year that she landed a role on the short-lived FOX sitcom Flying Blind. Although the series was critically acclaimed, it was canceled during its first season.  Leoni married commercial director Neil Tardio in 1992; the union ended in divorce in October 1995. In 1994, Tea was back on the big screen with a feature part in Wyatt Earp, as well as in the made-for-TV movie The Counterfeit Contessa, where she starred in the title role.  She guest starred on NBC's Frasier in February 1995, in a memorable episode in which she played Sam Malone's fiance.   tea does bad boys and the naked truth Leoni's profile was given a big boost when she appeared alongside Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in the summer hit Bad Boys, in 1995. Later that same year, she debuted as Nora Wilde on ABC's The Naked Truth. The sitcom was pulled from ABC after one season, and quickly picked up by NBC, where it became a hit and ran for another two seasons on the peacock network.  During her three-year stint on the series, she found time to appear on the big screen in the David O. Russell comedy Flirting with Disaster (1996), in the little-seen indie feature There's No Fish Food In Heaven (a.k.a. Life in the Fast Lane, 1998), and marry actor David Duchovny of The X-Files fame in May 1997.  tea leoni in deep impact Leoni landed the starring role of reporter Jenny Lerner in the "comet heading toward Earth" blockbuster Deep Impact (1998), and then took some time off to have a child. Daughter Madelaine West Duchovny was born on April 24, 1999.     Leoni returned to the silver screen in 2000, appearing opposite Nicolas Cage in The Family Man. She won a co-starring role in the 2001 sequel Jurassic Park III, and padded her resume with a starring role in Woody Allen's Hollywood Ending (2002) and a part in People I Know, with Al Pacino and Kim Basinger. Leoni next gave birth to son Kyd Miller Duchovny in June 2002.  tea in house of d & spanglish After a two-year hiatus, Leoni returned to acting with House of D (2004), husband Duchovny's first foray into film writing and directing.  Tea also landed a role in 2004's Spanglish, a comedy directed by James L. Brooks and starring Adam Sandler. In Fun with Dick and Jane (2005), Leoni recreates the role of Jane Harper, originally played by Jane Fonda in the 1977 version (Jim Carrey takes over the role formerly portrayed by George Segal).  In addition to her love for acting and her family, Tea is a major golf fanatic.
