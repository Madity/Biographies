 In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, National Book Award winner Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, Alexander Hamilton is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.” Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States. Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804. Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.

       Building on biographies by Richard Brookhiser and Willard Sterne Randall, Ron Chernows Alexander Hamilton provides what may be the most comprehensive modern examination of the often overlooked Founding Father. From the start, Chernow argues that Hamiltons premature death at age 49 left his record to be reinterpreted and even re-written by his more long-lived enemies, among them: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Monroe. Hamiltons achievements as first Secretary of the Treasury, co-author of The Federalist Papers, and member of the Constitutional Convention were clouded after his death by strident claims that he was an arrogant, self-serving monarchist. Chernow delves into the almost 22,000 pages of letters, manuscripts, and articles that make up Hamiltons legacy to reveal a man with a sophisticated intellect, a romantic spirit, and a late-blooming religiosity.   One fault of the book, is that Chernow is so convinced of Hamiltons excellence that his narrative sometimes becomes hagiographic. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Chernows account of the infamous duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804. He describes Hamiltons final hours as pious, while Burr, Jefferson, and Adams achieve an almost cartoonish villainy at the news of Hamiltons passing.  A defender of the union against New England secession and an opponent of slavery, Hamilton has a special appeal to modern sensibilities. Chernow argues that in contrast to Jefferson and Washingtons now outmoded agrarian idealism, Hamilton was "the prophet of the capitalist revolution" and the true forebear of modern America. In his Prologue, he writes: "In all probability, Alexander Hamilton is the foremost figure in American history who never attained the presidency, yet he probably had a much deeper and more lasting impact than many who did." With Alexander Hamilton, this impact can now be more widely appreciated. --Patrick O'Kelley
       After hulking works on J.P. Morgan, the Warburgs and John D. Rockefeller, what other grandee of American finance was left for Chernow's overflowing pen than the one who puts the others in the shade? Alexander Hamilton (17551804) created public finance in the United States. In fact, it's arguable that without Hamilton's political and financial strategic brilliance, the United States might not have survived beyond its early years. Chernow's achievement is to give us a biography commensurate with Hamilton's character, as well as the full, complex context of his unflaggingly active life. Possessing the most powerful (though not the most profound) intelligence of his gifted contemporaries, Hamilton rose from Caribbean bastardy through military service in Washington's circle to historic importance at an early age and then, in a new era of partisan politics, gradually lost his political bearings. Chernow makes fresh contributions to Hamiltoniana: no one has discovered so much about Hamilton's illegitimate origins and harrowed youth; few have been so taken by Hamilton's long-suffering, loving wife, Eliza. Yet it's hard not to cringe at some of Hamilton's hotheaded words and behavior, especially sacrificing the well-being of his family on the altar of misplaced honor. This is a fine work that captures Hamilton's life with judiciousness and verve. Illus.  Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
      Ron Chernow won the National Book Award in 1990 for his first book, The House of Morgan, and his second book, The Warburgs, won the Eccles Prize as the Best Business Book of 1993. His biography of John D. Rockefeller, Sr., Titan, was a national bestseller and a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist.

BurketHamilton was one of the most remarkable founding fathers.B. Laughlin
This is an excellent biography on Alexander Hamilton, a formidable and sometimes controversial figure among our Founding Fathers.  He is best known for being one of the main contributors to the Federalist Papers and being the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.There is a lot to like and be in awe about Alexander Hamilton.  There is also quite a bit to dislike.  Was he a visionary and a genius?  Or a power hungry and greedy autocratic figure reminiscent of the British the U.S. fought away at the time.  Through the past decades his place in history has gone through several reincarnations of both positive and negative revisionism.Ron Chernow is undoubtedly on the sides of the Hamilton fan.  However, even though his portrayal of Hamilton may not be totally objective.  It is nevertheless fascinating due to its breadth, and depth.  Hamilton comes across as a brilliant individual sometimes centuries ahead of his time.  Chernow develops a convincing case that Hamilton was without peers in his developing the necessary financial and economic infrastructure of what was going to become the modern U.S.If Adam Smith was the Scottish genius who invented modern economics, Hamilton was his American counterpart who actually applied modern economics principles in the governing of a new nation.  His understanding in such matters far surpassed his more famous political opponents such as Madison and Jefferson.Chernow mentions several examples of Hamilton's unique foresight.  One was Hamilton's successful defeat of the discrimination bill.  This was a nonsensical concept that proposed that capital gains on sales of treasury securities should flow back to the original investor.Read more ›
  It's hard to add anything new to the praise other readers have offered here, but...1. This book is FUN to read. You will become emotionally involved with the people, and privy to their thoughts and motives. You will cheer for some and hope others lose. I'm reminded, in a way, of Puzo's The Godfather. The characters are at least as vivid.2. Although a couple of people here have given the book single star ratings, reflecting their own current political points of view, I find that the central antagonists of this book, Hamilton and Jefferson, cannot easily be fit into today's liberal and conservative ranks.3. Today's political junkies will find many of these 18th century battles remarkably familiar, although there are no exact analogues to today's political players.4. If you're like me, you won't be able to keep quiet about the book. You'll find yourself reading passages to your spouse and telling stories about Hamilton to your friends.This is a thoroughly involving book. It is long, yes, but so is a good NFL game with a couple of overtimes. Unless you're a scholar of the period, you'll learn a great deal about what made America what it is today. And you'll wish, at least for a moment, that you were alive when Hamilton was and that you could have shared a dinner with him.
If I were able to give this book greater than 5 stars, I would.  Here is why:Chernow writes a complete biography, which while covering an immense amount of ground, still manages to be thoroughly interesting and provide numerous anecdotes and tidbits of information.  Though we all know the result, Chernow's treatment of the duel with Aaron Burr offers readers many "can not put the book down" moments which would explain the dark circles under my eyes one morning at work.  Still more amazing is Chernow's attention to the the (until now) little talked about reprocussions to the life of Aaron Burr (who was indicted for murder and on the lam while Vice President) and others around Hamilton including his seemingly amazing wife, Eliza.Besides being a supreme story on the life of the man who literally shaped this country's financial and trading system (despite strong opposition from Jefferson and his Federalist Paper co-hort Madison), Chernow reveals Hamilton's talents as an attorney and his explouts as a revolutionary war hero.  What was also startling was how much Washington relied on Hamilton's talents and advice during the war and thereafter to the point where Washington began to view Hamilton as his equal.  Further, Hamilton's push for the adoption of the US Constitution is clear despite opposition from many of those in this country including Jefferson himself who viewed this country as an agricultural society (which would have always doomed the US to always be Britain's dark sheep) and would have left the strongest powers with the states and not a central government.What was particularly amazing is how dirty and bruising politics was back in the late 18th and early 19th century.Read more ›

  I found this book much more engaging than McCullough's bio of John Adams.  Of the founding fathers' bios that I have read, Hamilton may be the one I would most like to have spent a long dinner listening to his ideas and political concerns.  Part of his quality is his underdog status.  A poor immigrant who was probably the only founding father to personify the American hope of rags-to-riches.As with almost all the other founding fathers, whose biographies I have read, Thomas Jefferson played a significant role.  As with some of these founding fathers, Jefferson played a villainous role.  I am still trying to find enough reason to glorify Jefferson, but the guy needed a good kick in the rear.Chernow provides excellent refutation of the Jeffersonian inspired negative images of Hamilton as an enemy of democracy and an aristocrat.  In a manner that would have made Hamilton proud, the author seems to take pleasure in noting the hypocrisy of the aristocratic Jefferson, and Madison attacking Hamilton who actually put his life on the line to win independence from Britain, and who may have been the first to have called for the Constitutional Convention to make this land into an actual country.  If the British ever saw Jefferson, it was only to glimpse the back of his horse as he fled to the hills at the first sight of a redcoat.Less happy for Hamilton is the author's honest assessment of Hamilton's weaknesses, of which there were many.  This is why any current day opponents of Hamilton (e.g., state rights exponents) would have to agree that this is a well-balanced treatment of its subject.  After finishing this book, I concluded that Hamilton would have been the brightest, and hardest working president in history, but his temperament would have surely doomed his administration.Hopefully, text book writers will incorporate the information in this book and give proper status for our students of this incredible, but flawed man.
      After reading Chernow's magnificent biography of George Washington, it just made sense to read his Hamilton.
      The most informative book I've read in a long time.  Fascinating account of our economic history, which I read because of a recommendation by Motley Fool.
      I majored in American History in college, but all through my education, I lamented that survey classes spent soooooooooooooooo much time slogging through the early years of the...
      This was an interesting as well as very informative book on the life of Alexander Hamilton.  Living part time in St. Croix first brought me to the book.
      Imagine you decide to read a biography about one of the coolest American patriots.  The book arrives and it's HUGE!
      I have this author's book on Washington so I decided to read this book.  I was not disappointed.  It is excellent.
      The book was thoroughly researched and offered insights into what molded Hamilton's personality, motivations, ambition, intellect and his love of his family and country.
      The only drawback is the boring page 6 stuff about personal indiscretions. Otherwise highly readable and makes you want to know all the fathers.
      Great book. You need to be a dedicated student of history to read this deep and detailed treatment of Hamilton and US history.
      I haven't read enough about Hamilton to know whether this biography is biased or not, but I did find it very informative and on that basis, I give it the rating I give it.

=======================================================
Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757 – July 12, 1804) was a Founding Father of the United States,[1] chief of staff to General Washington, one of the most influential interpreters and promoters of the Constitution, the founder of the nation's financial system, and the founder of the first American political party.
As Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the primary author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration, especially the funding of the state debts by the Federal government, the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain. He became the leader of the Federalist Party, created largely in support of his views, and was opposed by the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.
Hamilton served in the American Revolutionary War. At the start of the war, he organized an artillery company and was chosen as its captain. He later became the senior[2] aide-de-camp and confidant to General George Washington, the American commander-in-chief. He served again under Washington in the army raised to defeat the Whiskey Rebellion, a tax revolt of western farmers in 1794. In 1798, Hamilton called for mobilization against France after the XYZ Affair and secured an appointment as commander of a new army, which he trained for a war.[3] However, the Quasi-War, although hard-fought at sea, was never officially declared. In the end, President John Adams found a diplomatic solution that avoided war.
Born out of wedlock and raised in the West Indies, Hamilton was effectively orphaned at about the age of 11. Recognized for his abilities and talent, he was sponsored by people from his community to go to the North American mainland for his education. He attended King's College (now Columbia University), in New York City. After the American Revolutionary War, Hamilton was appointed to the Congress of the Confederation from New York. He resigned to practice law and founded the Bank of New York.
Hamilton was among those dissatisfied with the Articles of Confederation—the first attempt at a national governing document—because it lacked an executive, courts, and taxing powers. He led the Annapolis Convention, which successfully influenced Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention in order to create a new constitution. He was an active participant at Philadelphia and helped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of the Federalist Papers, which supported the new constitution and to this day is the single most important source for Constitutional interpretation.[4]
In the new government under President George Washington, Hamilton was appointed the Secretary of the Treasury. An admirer of British political systems, Hamilton was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution could be used to fund the national debt, assume state debts, and create the government-owned Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports and later also by a highly controversial excise tax on whiskey.
Embarrassed when an extra-marital affair from his past became public, Hamilton resigned from office in 1795 and returned to the practice of law in New York. He kept his hand in politics and was a powerful influence on the cabinet of President Adams (1797–1801). Hamilton's opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause his defeat in the 1800 election. When in the same contest Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied for the presidency in the electoral college, Hamilton helped defeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences. After failing to support Adams, the Federalist candidate, Hamilton lost some national prominence within the party. Vice President Burr later ran for governor in New York State, but Hamilton's influence in his home state was strong enough to again prevent a Burr victory. Taking offense at some of Hamilton's comments, Burr challenged him to a duel and mortally wounded Hamilton, who died the next day.
Alexander Hamilton was born in Charlestown, the capital of the island of Nevis, in the Leeward Islands; Nevis was one of the British West Indies. Hamilton was born out of wedlock to Rachel Faucette, a married woman of partial French Huguenot descent, and James A. Hamilton, the fourth son of the Scottish laird Alexander Hamilton of Grange, Ayrshire.[5]
His mother moved with the young Hamilton to St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, then ruled by Denmark. It is not certain whether the year of Hamilton's birth was 1757 or 1755; most historical evidence after Hamilton's arrival in North America supports the idea that he was born in 1757, and many historians had accepted this birth date. Hamilton's early life in the Caribbean was recorded in documents first published in Danish in 1930; this evidence has caused historians since then to opt for a birth year of 1755.[6] Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he first arrived in the Thirteen Colonies. He celebrated his birthday on January 11. In later life, he tended to give his age only in round figures. Probate papers from St. Croix in 1768, after the death of Hamilton's mother, list him as then 13 years old,[7] a date that would support a birth year of 1755. Historians have explained the different birth years by the following: If 1755 is correct, Hamilton may have been trying to appear younger than his college classmates or perhaps wished to avoid standing out as older; on the other hand, if 1757 is correct, the probate document indicating a birth year of 1755 may have been in error, or Hamilton may have been attempting to pass as 13, in order to be more employable after his mother's death.[8]
Hamilton's mother had been married previously to Johann Michael Lavien of St. Croix, a much older merchant planter, who is described in some accounts as Danish-Jewish.[5][9] [note 1] To escape this unhappy marriage, Rachel left her husband and first son, traveling to St. Kitts in 1750, where she met James Hamilton.[10] Hamilton and Rachel moved together to Rachel's birthplace, Nevis, where she had inherited property from her father.[6] Their two sons were James Jr., and Alexander. Because Alexander Hamilton's parents were not legally married, the Church of England denied him membership and education in the church school. Hamilton received "individual tutoring"[6] and classes in a private school led by a Jewish headmistress.[11] Hamilton supplemented his education with a family library of thirty-four books,[12] including Greek and Roman classics.
Hamilton's father James abandoned Rachel and their two sons, allegedly to "spar[e] [Rachel] a charge of bigamy . . . [after finding out that her first husband] intend[ed] to divorce her under Danish law on grounds of adultery and desertion."[5] Rachel supported her family in St. Croix by keeping a small store in Christiansted. She contracted a severe fever and died on February 19, 1768, 1:02 am, leaving Hamilton effectively orphaned. This may have had severe emotional consequences for him, even by the standards of an eighteenth-century childhood.[13] In probate court, Rachel's "first husband seized her estate"[5] and obtained the few valuables Rachel had owned, including some household silver. Many items were auctioned off, but a friend purchased the family books and returned them to the young Hamilton.[14]
Hamilton became a clerk at a local import-export firm, Beekman and Cruger, which traded with New England; he was left in charge of the firm for five months in 1771, while the owner was at sea. He and his older brother James were adopted briefly by a cousin, Peter Lytton, but when Lytton committed suicide, the brothers were separated.[15] James apprenticed with a local carpenter, while Alexander was adopted by a Nevis merchant, Thomas Stevens. According to the writer Ron Chernow, some evidence suggests that Stevens may have been Alexander Hamilton's biological father: his son, Edward Stevens, became a close friend of Hamilton. The two boys were described as looking much alike, were both fluent in French, and shared similar interests.[16]
Hamilton continued clerking, but he remained an avid reader, later developed an interest in writing, and began to desire a life outside the small island where he lived. He wrote an essay published in the Royal Danish-American Gazette, a detailed account of a hurricane that had devastated Christiansted on August 30, 1772. The essay impressed community leaders, who collected a fund to send the young Hamilton to the North American colonies for his education.[17]

In the autumn of 1772, Hamilton arrived by way of Boston, Massachusetts, at Elizabethtown Academy, a grammar school in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. In 1773 he studied with Francis Barber at Elizabethtown in preparation for college work. He came under the influence of William Livingston, a leading intellectual and revolutionary, with whom he lived for a time at his Liberty Hall.[18] Hamilton matriculated at King's College in New York City (now Columbia University) in late 1773 or early 1774.[19]
When the Church of England clergyman Samuel Seabury published a series of pamphlets promoting the Loyalist cause in 1774, Hamilton responded with his first political writings, "A Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress" and "The Farmer Refuted". He published two additional pieces attacking the Quebec Act[20] as well as fourteen anonymous installments of "The Monitor" for Holt's New York Journal. Although Hamilton was a supporter of the Revolutionary cause at this prewar stage, he did not approve of mob reprisals against Loyalists. On May 10, 1775, Hamilton supposedly saved his college president Myles Cooper, a Loyalist, from an angry mob by speaking to the crowd long enough for Cooper to escape.[21]
In 1775, after the first engagement of American troops with the British in Boston, Hamilton joined a New York volunteer militia company called the Hearts of Oak, which included other King's College students. He drilled with the company, before classes, in the graveyard of nearby St. Paul's Chapel.[22] Hamilton studied military history and tactics on his own and achieved the rank of lieutenant. Under fire from HMS Asia, he led a successful raid for British cannon in the Battery, the capture of which resulted in the Hearts of Oak becoming an artillery company thereafter.[23] Through his connections with influential New York patriots such as Alexander McDougall and John Jay, he raised the New York Provincial Company of Artillery of sixty men in 1776, and was elected captain.[24] It took part in the campaign of 1776 around New York City, particularly at the Battle of White Plains; at the Battle of Trenton, it was stationed at the high point of town, the meeting of the present Warren and Broad Streets, to keep the Hessians pinned in the Trenton Barracks.[25]
Hamilton was invited to become an aide to Nathanael Greene and to Henry Knox;[26] however, he declined these invitations, believing his best chance for improving his station in life was glory on the battlefield. Hamilton eventually received an invitation he felt he could not refuse: to serve as Washington's aide, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.[27] Hamilton served for four years as Washington's chief of staff. He handled letters to Congress, state governors, and the most powerful generals in the Continental Army; he drafted many of Washington's orders and letters at the latter's direction; he eventually issued orders from Washington over Hamilton's own signature.[2] Hamilton was involved in a wide variety of high-level duties, including intelligence, diplomacy, and negotiation with senior army officers as Washington's emissary.[28] The important duties with which he was entrusted attest to Washington's deep confidence in his abilities and character, then and afterward. At the points in their relationship when there was little personal attachment, there was still always a reciprocal confidence and respect.
During the war, Hamilton became close friends with several fellow officers. His letters to the Marquis de Lafayette[29] and to John Laurens, employing the sentimental literary conventions of the late eighteenth century and alluding to Greek history and mythology,[30] have been read by Jonathan Katz as revealing a homosocial or perhaps homosexual relationship, but few historians agree.[31]
Hamilton married Elizabeth Schuyler on December 14, 1780.[32] She was the daughter of Philip Schuyler, a general and wealthy landowner from one of the most prominent families in the state of New York. The marriage took place at Schuyler Mansion in Albany, New York.[33]
Hamilton was also close to Eliza's older sister, Angelica, who eloped with John Barker Church, an Englishman who made a fortune in North America during the Revolution. She returned with Church to London after the war, where she later become a joint friend of Maria Cosway and Thomas Jefferson.
While on Washington's staff, Hamilton long sought command and a return to active combat. As the war drew nearer to a close, he knew that opportunities for military glory were fading. In February 1781, Hamilton was mildly reprimanded by Washington, and used this as an excuse to resign his staff position. He asked Washington and others for a field command. This continued until early July 1781, when Hamilton submitted a letter to Washington with his commission enclosed, "thus tacitly threatening to resign if he didn't get his desired command."[34]
On July 31, 1781, Washington relented and assigned Hamilton as commander of a New York light infantry battalion.[35] In the planning for the assault on Yorktown, Hamilton was given command of three battalions, which were to fight in conjunction with French troops in taking Redoubts No. 9 and No. 10 of the British fortifications at Yorktown. Hamilton and his battalions fought bravely and took Redoubt No. 10 with bayonets in a nighttime action, as planned. The French also fought bravely, took heavy casualties, and successfully took Redoubt #9. This action forced the British surrender of an entire army at Yorktown, effectively ending major British military operations in North America.[36]
After the Battle of Yorktown, Hamilton resigned his commission. He was appointed in July 1782 to the Congress of the Confederation as a New York representative for the term beginning in November 1782.[37] Hamilton supported congressmen such as Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, his assistant Gouverneur Morris (no relation), along with James Wilson and James Madison, to provide the Congress with the independent source of revenue it lacked under the Articles of Confederation.
While on Washington's staff, Hamilton had become frustrated with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had made it difficult for the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans.[38]
An amendment to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also the ability to make laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax, since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.[39]
While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented soldiers began to pose a danger to the young United States. Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of half their pay when they were discharged.[40] It was at this time that a group of officers organized under the leadership of General Henry Knox sent a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander MacDougall (see above). The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment.
Several Congressmen, including Hamilton and the Morrises, attempted to use this Newburgh Conspiracy as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government. They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met, and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: that the states assume the debt to the army, or that an impost be established dedicated to the sole purpose of paying that debt.[41] Hamilton suggested using the Army's claims to prevail upon the states for the proposed national funding system.[42] The Morrises and Hamilton contacted Knox to suggest he and the officers defy civil authority, at least by not disbanding if the army were not satisfied; Hamilton wrote Washington to suggest that Hamilton covertly "take direction" of the officers' efforts to secure redress, to secure continental funding but keep the army within the limits of moderation.[43] Washington wrote Hamilton back, declining to introduce the army;[44] after the crisis had ended, he warned of the dangers of using the army as leverage to gain support for the national funding plan.[45]
On March 15, Washington defused the Newburgh situation by giving a speech to the officers.[41] Congress ordered the Army officially disbanded in April 1783. In the same month, Congress passed a new measure for a twenty-five-year impost—which Hamilton voted against[46]—that again required the consent of all the states; it also approved a commutation of the officers' pensions to five years of full pay. Rhode Island again opposed these provisions, and Hamilton's robust assertions of national prerogatives in his previous letter were widely held to be excessive.[47] The Continental Congress was never able to secure full ratification for back pay, pensions, or its own independent sources of funding.
In June 1783, a different group of disgruntled soldiers from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sent Congress a petition demanding their back pay. When they began to march toward Philadelphia, Congress charged Hamilton and two others with intercepting the mob.[48] Hamilton requested militia from Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council, but was turned down. Hamilton instructed Assistant Secretary of War William Jackson to intercept the men. Jackson was unsuccessful. The mob arrived in Philadelphia, and the soldiers proceeded to harangue Congress for their pay. The President of Congress, John Dickinson, feared that the Pennsylvania state militia was unreliable, and refused its help. Hamilton argued that Congress ought to adjourn to Princeton, New Jersey. Congress agreed, and relocated there.[49]
Frustrated with the weakness of the central government, Hamilton while in Princeton drafted a call to revise the Articles of Confederation. This resolution contained many features of the future US Constitution, including a strong federal government with the ability to collect taxes and raise an army. It also included the separation of powers into the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.[50]
Hamilton resigned from Congress, and in July 1783 was authorized to practice law in New York after several months of self-directed education.[51] He practiced law in New York City in partnership with Richard Harison. He specialized in defending Tories and British subjects, as in Rutgers v. Waddington, in which he defeated a claim for damages done to a brewery by the Englishmen who held it during the military occupation of New York. He pleaded for the Mayor's Court to interpret state law consistent with the 1783 Treaty of Paris which had ended the Revolutionary War.[52]
In 1784, he founded the Bank of New York, now the oldest ongoing bank in the United States. Hamilton was one of the men who restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality.[53]
In 1787, Hamilton served as assemblyman from New York County in the New York State Legislature and was the first delegate chosen to the Constitutional Convention. Even though Hamilton had been a leader in calling for a new Constitutional Convention, his direct influence at the Convention itself was quite limited. Governor George Clinton's faction in the New York legislature had chosen New York's other two delegates, John Lansing and Robert Yates, and both of them opposed Hamilton's goal of a strong national government. Thus, whenever the other two members of the New York delegation were present, they decided New York's vote; and when they left the convention in protest, Hamilton remained but with no vote, since two representatives were required for any state to cast a vote.
Early in the Convention he made a speech proposing a President-for-Life; it had no effect upon the deliberations of the convention. He proposed to have an elected President and elected Senators who would serve for life, contingent upon "good behavior" and subject to removal for corruption or abuse; this idea contributed later to the hostile view of Hamilton as a monarchist sympathizer, held by James Madison. During the convention, Hamilton constructed a draft for the Constitution based on the convention debates, but he never presented it. This draft had most of the features of the actual Constitution, including such details as the three-fifths clause. In this draft, the Senate was to be elected in proportion to the population, being two-fifths the size of the House, and the President and Senators were to be elected through complex multistage elections, in which chosen electors would elect smaller bodies of electors; they would hold office for life, but were removable for misconduct. The President would have an absolute veto. The Supreme Court was to have immediate jurisdiction over all law suits involving the United States, and state governors were to be appointed by the federal government.[54]
At the end of the Convention, Hamilton was still not content with the final form of the Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast improvement over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also.[55] Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution. He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. Hamilton recruited John Jay and James Madison to write a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution, now known as the Federalist Papers, and made the largest contribution to that effort, writing 51 of 85 essays published (Madison wrote 29, Jay only five). Hamilton's essays and arguments were influential in New York state, and elsewhere, during the debates over ratification. The Federalist Papers are more often cited than any other primary source by jurists, lawyers, historians, and political scientists as the major contemporary interpretation of the Constitution.[56][note 2]
"Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indisoluble Union, concur in erecting one great American system, superior to the control of all trans-Atlantic force or influence and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world!" [57]
In 1788, Hamilton served yet another term in what proved to be the last session of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation. When the term of Hamilton's father-in-law Phillip Schuyler was up in 1791, elected in his place was the attorney general of New York, one Aaron Burr. Hamilton blamed Burr for this result, and ill characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter. The two men did work together from time to time thereafter on various projects, including Hamilton's army of 1798 and the Manhattan Water Company.[58]
President George Washington appointed Hamilton as the first United States Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789. He left office on the last day of January 1795. Much of the structure of the government of the United States was worked out in those five years, beginning with the structure and function of the cabinet itself. Forrest McDonald argues that Hamilton saw his office, like that of the British First Lord of the Treasury, as the equivalent of a Prime Minister; Hamilton would oversee his colleagues under the elective reign of George Washington. Washington did request Hamilton's advice and assistance on matters outside the purview of the Treasury Department.
Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports: Communicated to the House of Representatives, April 23, 1790.
Second Report on Public Credit – Report on a National Bank. Communicated to the House of Representatives, December 14, 1790.
Report on the Establishment of a Mint: Communicated to the House of Representatives, January 28, 1791.
In the Report on Public Credit, the Secretary made a controversial proposal that would have the federal government assume state debts incurred during the Revolution.[59] This would give the federal government much more power by placing the country's most serious financial obligation in the hands of the federal government rather than the state governments.
The primary criticism of the plan was from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson[59] and Representative James Madison. Some states, such as Jefferson's Virginia, had paid almost half of their debts, and felt that their taxpayers should not be assessed again to bail out the less provident. They further argued that the plan passed beyond the scope of the new Constitutional government.
Madison objected to Hamilton's proposal to lower the rate of interest and postpone payments on federal debt as not being payment in full; he also objected to the speculative profits being made. Much of the national debt was in the form of bonds issued to Continental veterans, in place of wages the Continental Congress did not have the money to pay. As the bonds continued to go unpaid, many had been pawned for a small fraction of their value. Madison proposed to pay in full, but to divide payment between the original recipient and the present possessor. Others, such as Samuel Livermore of New Hampshire, wished to curb speculation, and reduce taxation, by paying only part of the bond. The disagreements between Madison and Hamilton extended to other proposals Hamilton made to Congress, and drew in Jefferson when he returned from serving as minister to France. Hamilton's supporters became known as Federalists and Jefferson's as Republicans. As Madison put it:
"I deserted Colonel Hamilton, or rather Colonel H. deserted me; in a word, the divergence between us took place from his wishing to administration, or rather to administer the Government into what he thought it ought to be..."[60]
Hamilton eventually secured passage of his assumption plan by striking a deal with Jefferson and Madison. Hamilton would use his influence to place the permanent national capital on the Potomac River, and Jefferson and Madison would encourage their friends to back Hamilton's assumption plan. In the end, Hamilton's assumption, together with his proposals for funding the debt, overcame legislative opposition and narrowly passed the House on July 26, 1790.[61]
Hamilton's Report on a National Bank was a projection from the first Report on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas of a national bank as early as 1779,[62] he gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from Adam Smith,[63] extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and his experience in establishing the Bank of New York.[64] His also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary Tench Coxe.[64]
Hamilton suggested that Congress should charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10 million, one-fifth of which would be handled by the Government. Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments.[65] The rest was to be available to individual investors.[66] The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction.[62] Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences.[67] For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.[68]
The bill passed through the Senate practically without a problem, but objections of the proposal increased by the time it reached the House of Representatives. It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank,[69] and those of the agrarian lifestyle would not benefit from it.[70] Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from The Federalist Papers.[70] Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill; however, the potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.[71] Madison warned the Pennsylvania congress members that he would attack the bill as unconstitutional in the House, and followed up on his threat.[72] Madison argued his case of where the power of a bank could be established within the Constitution, but he failed to sway members of the House, and his authority on the constitution was question by a few members.[73] The bill eventually passed in an overwhelming fashion 39 to 20, on the 8th of February, 1791.[74]
Washington hesitated to sign the bill, as he received suggestions from Attorney-General Edmund Randolph and Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson dismissed the 'necessary and proper' clause as reasoning for the creation of a national bank, stating that the enumerated powers "can all be carried into execution without a bank."[75] Along with Randolph and Jefferson's objections, Washington's involvement in the movement of the capital from Philadelphia is also thought to be a reason for his hesitation.[76] In response to the objection of the 'necessary and proper' clause, Hamilton stated that "Necessary often means no more than needful, requisite, incidental, useful, or conductive to", and the bank was a "convenient species of medium in which they (taxes) are to be paid.".[77] Washington would eventually sign the bill into law.[77]
In 1791, Hamilton submitted Report on the Establishment of a Mint to the House of Representatives. Most of Hamilton's ideas for this report were from European economists, resolutions from Continental Congress meetings from 1785 and 1786, and from people such as Gouverneur Morris and Thomas Jefferson.[78][79] Due to the Spanish coin being the most circulated coin in the United States at the time, Alexander Hamilton proposed that the minting of the United States dollar weighing almost as much as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency.[80] Hamilton wanted the U.S. dollar system to be set for decimals rather than the eights like the Spanish mint.[81] In spite of preferring a monometallic gold standard,[82] he issued a bimetallic currency at ratio that was to be similar to most European countries.[79][83] What was different from the European currencies was his desire to overprice the gold on the grounds that the United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies.[79] Hamilton desired the minting of small value coins such as silver ten-cent, copper, and half-cent pieces, for reducing the cost of living for the poor.[64][84] His motives weren't motivated for charity, as he also had objectives of the general public to become accustomed to handling money on a frequent basis.[84]
By 1792, Hamilton's principles were adopted by Congress, resulting in the Coinage Act of 1792, and the creation of the United States Mint. There was to be a ten dollar Gold Eagle coin, a silver dollar, and fractional money ranging from one-half to fifty cents.[82] The coining of silver and gold was issued by 1795.[82]
Smuggling off American coasts was an issue before the Revolutionary War, and after the Revolution it was more problematic. Along with smuggling, lack of shipping control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems.[85] In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband.[86] This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the American economy, and promote the merchant marine.[85] It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.[87]
Concerning some of the details of the "System of Cutters",[88] [note 3] Hamilton wanted the first ten cutters in different areas in the United States, from New England to Georgia.[86][89] Hamilton also wanted those cutters to be armed with ten muskets and bayonets, twenty pistols, two chisels, one broad-ax and two lanterns. Hamilton also wanted the fabric of the sails to be domestically manufactured.[86] Hamilton was also concerned of the employees' food supply and etiquette when boarding ships, and made provisions for each.[86]
Congress established the Revenue Cutter Service on August 4, 1790, which is viewed as the birth of the United States Coast Guard.[85]
One of the principal sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an excise tax on whiskey. Strong opposition to the whiskey tax by cottage producers in remote, rural regions erupted into the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794; in Western Pennsylvania and western Virginia, whiskey was the basic export product and was fundamental to the local economy. In response to the rebellion, believing compliance with the laws was vital to the establishment of federal authority, Hamilton accompanied to the rebellion's site President Washington, General Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee, and more federal troops than were ever assembled in one place during the Revolution. This overwhelming display of force intimidated the leaders of the insurrection, ending the rebellion virtually without bloodshed.[90]

Hamilton's next report was his Report on Manufactures. Although he was requested by Congress on 15 January of 1790 for a report for manufacturing that would expand the United States independence, the report was not submitted until 5 December of 1791.[91] In the report, Hamilton quoted from Wealth of Nations and used the French physiocrats as an example for rejecting agrarianism and the physiocratic theory; respectively.[92] Hamilton also refuted Smith's ideas of government noninterference, as it would have been detrimental for trade with other countries.[93] Hamilton also thought of the United States being a primarily agrarian country would be a disadvantage in dealing with Europe.[94] In response to the agrarian detractors, Hamilton stated that the agriculturists' interest would be advanced by manufactures,[95] and that agriculture was just as productive as manufacturing.[92][95]
Among the ways that the government could assist in manufacturing, Hamilton mentioned levying protective duties on imported foreign goods that were also manufactured in the United States,[96] to withdraw duties levied on raw materials needed for domestic manufacturing,[96][97] pecuniary boundaries,[97] and encouraging immigration for people to better themselves in similar employment opportunities.[96][98]
Congress shelved the report without much debate (except for Madison's objection to Hamilton's formulation of the General Welfare clause, which Hamilton construed liberally as a legal basis for his extensive programs). The Report has been often quoted by protectionists since.[99]
Subsequently in 1791, with his ideas for manufacturing being a major influence, Hamilton, along with Coxe and several entrepreneurs from New York and Philadelphia helped form the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures, a private industrial corporation. The location at Great Falls of the Passaic River in New Jersey was selected due to access to raw materials, it being densely inhabited, and having access to water power from the falls of the Passaic.[100] The factory town was named Paterson after New Jersey's Governor William Paterson, who signed the charter.[101][102] The profits were to derive from specific corporates rather than the benefits to be conferred to the nation and the citizens, which was unlike the report.[103] Hamilton also suggested the first stock to be offered at $500,000 and to eventually increase to $1 million, and welcomed state and national government subscriptions alike.[103][104] The company never materialized any success as numerous shareholders reneged on stock payments, some of the Society's members were soon bankrupt, while William Duer, the governor of the program, wounded up in debtors' prison.[102][104] In spite of Hamilton efforts to mend the disaster, the company would expire by 1796.[102]
During Hamilton's tenure as Treasury Secretary, political factions began to emerge. A Congressional caucus, led by James Madison and William Branch Giles, began as an opposition group to Hamilton's financial programs, and Thomas Jefferson joined this group when he returned from France. Hamilton and his allies began to call themselves Federalists. The opposition group, now called the Democratic-Republican Party by political scientists, was at the time known as Republicans,.[105][note 4]
Hamilton assembled a nationwide coalition to garner support for the Administration, including the expansive financial programs Hamilton had made Administration policy and especially the president's policy of neutrality in the European war between Britain and France. Hamilton's public relations campaign attacked the French minister Edmond-Charles Genêt (he called himself "Citizen Genêt") who tried to appeal to voters directly, which Federalists denounced as foreign interference in American affairs.[106]
The Jeffersonian Republicans opposed banks and cities, and favored France. They built their own national coalition to oppose the Federalists. Both sides gained the support of local political factions; each side developed its own partisan newspapers. Noah Webster, John Fenno, and William Cobbett were energetic editors for the Federalists; Benjamin Franklin Bache and Philip Freneau were fiery Republican editors. All the newspapers were characterized by intense personal attacks, major exaggerations and invented claims. In 1801, Hamilton established a daily newspaper, the New York Evening Post and brought in William Coleman as editor. It is still publishing (as the New York Post).[107]
When France and Britain went to war in early 1793, all four members of the Cabinet were consulted on what to do. They and Washington unanimously agreed to remain neutral, and to send Genêt home.[108]
However, in 1794 policy toward Britain became a major point of contention between the two parties. Hamilton and the Federalists wished for more trade with Britain, the new nation's largest trading partner. The Republicans saw Britain as the main threat to republicanism and proposed instead a trade war.
To avoid war, Washington sent Chief Justice John Jay to negotiate with the British; Hamilton largely wrote Jay's instructions. The result was Jay's Treaty. It was denounced by the Republicans but Hamilton mobilized support up and down the land.[109] The Jay Treaty passed the Senate in 1795 by exactly the required two-thirds majority. The Treaty resolved issues remaining from the Revolution, averted war, and made possible ten years of peaceful trade between the United States and Britain.[110] Historian George Herring notes the "remarkable and fortuitous economic and diplomatic gains" produced by the Treaty.[111]
Several European nations had formed a League of Armed Neutrality against incursions on their neutral rights; the Cabinet was also consulted on whether the United States should join it, and decided not to. It kept that decision secret, but Hamilton revealed it in private to George Hammond, the British Minister to the United States, without telling Jay or anyone else. (His act remained unknown until Hammond's dispatches were read in the 1920s). This "amazing revelation" may have had limited effect on the negotiations; Jay did threaten to join the League at one point, but the British had other reasons not to view the League as a serious threat.[112]
In 1791, Hamilton became involved in an affair with Maria Reynolds that would eventually badly damage his reputation. Reynolds's complicit husband, James, blackmailed Hamilton for money by threatening to inform Hamilton's wife.[113] When James Reynolds was arrested for counterfeiting, he contacted several prominent members of the Democratic-Republican Party, most notably James Monroe and Aaron Burr, touting that he could expose a top-level official for corruption. Presuming that James Reynolds could implicate Hamilton in an abuse of his position in Washington's Cabinet, they interviewed Hamilton with their suspicions. Hamilton insisted he was innocent of any misconduct in public office, but admitted to an affair with Maria Reynolds. Since this was not germane to Hamilton's conduct in office, Hamilton's interviewers did not publish about Reynolds. When rumors began spreading after his retirement some years later, Hamilton published a confession of his affair, shocking his family and supporters by not merely confessing but also by inexplicably narrating the affair at an unexpected level of detail. This public revelation damaged Hamilton's reputation for the rest of his life.
Hamilton's resignation as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 did not remove him from public life. With the resumption of his law practice, he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend. Hamilton influenced Washington in the composition of his Farewell Address; Washington and members of his Cabinet often consulted with him.
In the election of 1796, under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential electors had two votes, which they were to cast for different men. The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President. This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, as they had been thought disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned to deal with this by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina (who was on his way home from being Minister to Spain, where he had negotiated a popular treaty); Jefferson chose Aaron Burr as his vice presidential running mate.
Adams resented Hamilton's influence with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous in his private life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President. Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President; but it did not work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President.[114] Adams resented the intrigue, since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's.[115]
During the Quasi-War of 1798–1800, and with Washington's strong endorsement, Adams reluctantly appointed Hamilton a major general of the army (essentially placing him in command, since Washington could no longer leave Mt. Vernon). If full-scale war broke out with France, Hamilton argued that the army should conquer the North American colonies of France's ally, Spain, bordering the United States.[116]
To fund this army, Hamilton wrote regularly to Oliver Wolcott, Jr., his successor at the Treasury; William Loughton Smith, of the House Ways and Means Committee; and Senator Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts. He directed them to pass a direct tax to fund the war. Smith resigned in July 1797, as Hamilton scolded him for slowness, and told Wolcott to tax houses instead of land.[117]
The eventual program included a Stamp Act like that of the British before the Revolution and other taxes on land, houses, and slaves, calculated at different rates in different states, and requiring difficult and intricate assessment of houses.[118] This provoked resistance in southeastern Pennsylvania, led primarily by men such as John Fries who had marched with Washington against the Whiskey Rebellion.[119]
Hamilton aided in all areas of the army's development, and officially served as the Senior Officer of the United States Army as a Major General from December 14, 1799, to June 15, 1800. The army was to guard against invasion from France. Adams, however, derailed all plans for war by opening negotiations with France.[120] Adams had held it proper to retain the members of Washington's cabinet, except for cause; he found, in 1800 (after Washington's death), that they were obeying Hamilton rather than himself, and fired several of them.[121]
In the 1800 election, Hamilton worked to defeat not only the rival Democratic-Republican candidates, but also his party's own nominee, John Adams.
In November 1799, the Alien and Sedition Acts had left one Democratic-Republican newspaper functioning in New York City; when the last, the New Daily Advertiser, reprinted an article saying that Hamilton had attempted to purchase the Philadelphia Aurora and close it down, Hamilton had the publisher prosecuted for seditious libel, and the prosecution compelled the owner to close the paper.[122]
Aaron Burr had won New York for Jefferson in May; now Hamilton proposed a rerun of the election under different rules—with carefully drawn districts and each choosing an elector—such that the Federalists would split the electoral vote of New York.[note 5] (John Jay, a Federalist who had given up the Supreme Court to be Governor of New York, wrote on the back of the letter the words, "Proposing a measure for party purposes which it would not become me to adopt," and declined to reply.)[123]
John Adams was running this time with Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina. Hamilton now toured New England, again urging northern electors to hold firm for Pinckney in the renewed hope of making Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina.[citation needed] This time the important reaction was from the Jeffersonian electors, all of whom voted for both Jefferson and Burr, ensuring there was no result of electing a Federalist. (Burr had received only one vote from Virginia in 1796.)
In September, Hamilton wrote a pamphlet called Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams, Esq. President of the United States that was highly critical of Adams, though it closed with a tepid endorsement. He mailed this to two hundred leading Federalists; when a copy fell into the Democratic-Republicans' hands, they printed it. This hurt Adams's 1800 reelection campaign and split the Federalist Party, virtually assuring the victory of the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Jefferson, in the election of 1800; it destroyed Hamilton's position among the Federalists.[124]
On the Federalist side, Governor Arthur Fenner of Rhode Island denounced these "jockeying tricks" to make Pinckney President, and one Rhode Island elector voted for Adams and Jay. Jefferson and Burr tied for first and second; Pinckney came in fourth.[125]
Jefferson had beaten Adams, but both he and his running mate, Aaron Burr, had received 73 votes in the Electoral College. With Jefferson and Burr tied, the United States House of Representatives had to choose between the two men. (As a result of this election, the Twelfth Amendment was proposed and ratified, adopting the method under which presidential elections are held today.) Several Federalists who opposed Jefferson supported Burr, and for the first 35 ballots, Jefferson was denied a majority. Before the 36th ballot, Hamilton threw his weight behind Jefferson, supporting the arrangement reached by James A. Bayard of Delaware, in which five Federalist Representatives from Maryland and Vermont abstained from voting, allowing those states' delegations to go for Jefferson, ending the impasse and electing Jefferson President rather than Burr. Even though Hamilton did not like Jefferson and disagreed with him on many issues, he viewed Jefferson as the lesser of two evils. Hamilton spoke of Jefferson as being "by far not so a dangerous man", and that Burr was a "mischievous enemy" to the principle measure of the past administration.[126] There is strong circumstantial evidence, however, that what Hamilton really feared was Burr's appeal to the members of the Federalist Party and loss of his control over them. Many Federalists viewed Burr as a moderate who was willing to dialogue with them. It was for that reason, along with the fact that Burr was a northerner and not a Virginian, that many Federalist Representatives voted for him.[127] Burr then became Vice President of the United States. When it became clear that Jefferson developed his own concerns about Burr and would not support his return to the Vice Presidency, Burr sought the New York governorship in 1804 with Federalist support, against the Jeffersonian Morgan Lewis, but was defeated by forces including Hamilton.[128]
In 1801, Hamilton announced his intention to withdraw from the Federalist Party if Burr became its presidential candidate in 1804. In 1802, he began to organize "The Christian Constitutional Society", the first principle of which, even before supporting the Constitution, was "the support of the Christian religion".[129]
Hamilton fighting his fatal duel with Vice President Aaron Burr (the depiction is inaccurate: only the two "seconds" actually witnessed the duel)
Soon after the 1804 gubernatorial election in New York—in which Morgan Lewis, greatly assisted by Hamilton, defeated Aaron Burr—the Albany Register published Charles D. Cooper's letters, citing Hamilton's opposition to Burr and alleging that Hamilton had expressed "a still more despicable opinion" of the Vice President at an upstate New York dinner party.[130][131] Burr, sensing an attack on his honor, and surely still stung by his political defeat, demanded an apology. Hamilton refused because he could not recall the instance.
Following an exchange of three testy letters, and despite attempts of friends to avert a confrontation, a duel was scheduled for July 11, 1804, along the west bank of the Hudson River on a rocky ledge in Weehawken, New Jersey. This was the same dueling site at which Hamilton's eldest son, Philip, had been killed three years earlier.
At dawn, the duel began, and Vice President Aaron Burr shot Hamilton. Hamilton's shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr's head. A letter that he wrote the night before the duel states, "I have resolved, if our interview [duel] is conducted in the usual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving my second fire", thus asserting an intention to miss Burr. The circumstances of the duel, and Hamilton's actual intentions, are still disputed. Neither of the seconds, Pendleton or Van Ness, could determine who fired first. Soon after, they measured and triangulated the shooting, but could not determine from which angle Hamilton fired. Burr's shot, however, hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip. The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton's second or third false rib, fracturing it and caused considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra. Biographer Ron Chernow considers the circumstances to indicate that Burr fired second, after having taken deliberate aim.
If a duelist decided not to aim at his opponent there was a well-known procedure, available to everyone involved, for doing so. According to historian Joanne Freeman, Hamilton apparently did not follow this procedure; if he had, Burr might have followed suit, and Hamilton's death might have been avoided. It was a matter of honor among gentlemen to follow these rules. Because of the high incidence of septicemia and death resulting from torso wounds, a high percentage of duels employed this procedure of throwing away fire.[130] Years later, when told that Hamilton may have misled him at the duel, the ever-laconic Burr replied, "Contemptible, if true."[132]
The paralyzed Hamilton, who knew himself to be mortally wounded, was ferried back to New York[133] and taken to the Greenwich Village home of his friend William Bayard Jr., who had been waiting on the dock. After final visits from his family and friends and considerable suffering, Hamilton died on the following afternoon, July 12, 1804 at Bayard's home at what is now 80–82 Jane Street.[134] Gouverneur Morris, a political ally of Hamilton's, gave the eulogy at his funeral and secretly established a fund to support his widow and children. Hamilton was buried in the Trinity Churchyard Cemetery in Manhattan.
Hamilton's interpretations of the Constitution set forth in the Federalist Papers remain highly influential, as seen in scholarly studies and court decisions.[135]
From his first days as a cabinet member Hamilton set a precedent by formulating federal programs, writing them as reports, pushing for their approval by arguing for them in person on the floor of the United States Congress, and then implementing them. Hamilton and the other Cabinet members were vital to Washington, as there was no executive branch under the Articles of Confederation, and the Cabinet itself is unmentioned in the Constitution that succeeded it.
Though the Constitution was ambiguous as to the exact balance of power between national and state governments, Hamilton consistently took the side of greater federal power at the expense of the states.[136] As Secretary of the Treasury, he established—against the intense opposition of Secretary of State Jefferson—the country's first national bank. Hamilton justified the creation of this bank, and other increased federal powers, under Congress's constitutional powers to issue currency, to regulate interstate commerce, and to do anything else that would be "necessary and proper" to enact the provisions of the Constitution. Jefferson, on the other hand, took a stricter view of the Constitution: parsing the text carefully, he found no specific authorization for a national bank. This controversy was eventually settled by the Supreme Court of the United States in McCulloch v. Maryland, which in essence adopted Hamilton's view, granting the federal government broad freedom to select the best means to execute its constitutionally enumerated powers, specifically the doctrine of implied powers.[137]
Hamilton's policies as Secretary of the Treasury greatly affected the United States government and still continue to influence it. His constitutional interpretation, specifically of the Necessary and Proper Clause, set precedents for federal authority that are still used by the courts and are considered an authority on constitutional interpretation. The prominent French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, who spent 1794 in the United States, wrote, "I consider Napoleon, Fox, and Hamilton the three greatest men of our epoch, and if I were forced to decide between the three, I would give without hesitation the first place to Hamilton", adding that Hamilton had intuited the problems of European conservatives[138]
Opinions of Hamilton have run the gamut: both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson viewed him as unprincipled and dangerously aristocratic. Aaron Burr shot him. Hamilton's reputation was mostly negative in the eras of Jeffersonian democracy and Jacksonian democracy. However by the Progressive era, Herbert Croly, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt praised his leadership of a strong government. Several nineteenth- and twentieth-century Republicans entered politics by writing laudatory biographies of Hamilton.[note 6]
These have evolved into the two, now traditional, views of Hamilton: One, which has been dominant among scholars in recent years, represents him as a "forerunner of the modern liberal capitalist economy," opposed to the agrarianism, or the slave-holding self-interest, of Jefferson and Madison. The other has seen him as a centralizer, to the point sometimes of advocating monarchy. Gordon Wood presented a third view in Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789–1815; Hamilton would have set up an essentially European society, with a republican monarchy, and strong institutions such as the Bank of the United States; Wood holds that Jefferson better understood the society around him, individualist, egalitarian, and money-making.[139]

The Hamilton Grange National Memorial, now located in St. Nicholas Park. The Grange is the only home Hamilton ever owned and is where he was living at the time of his death.
By the time of the American Civil War, Hamilton's portrait began to appear on US currency, including the $2, $5, $10, and $50 notes. His likeness also began to appear on US postage in 1870. His portrait has continued to appear on US postage and currency, and most notably appears on the modern $10 bill. Hamilton also appears on the $500 Series EE Savings Bond. The source of the face on the $10 bill is John Trumbull's 1805 portrait of Hamilton, in the portrait collection of New York City Hall.[140] On the south side of the Treasury Building in Washington is a statue of Hamilton.
On March 19, 1956, the United States Postal Service issued the $5 Liberty Issue postage stamp honoring Hamilton.
The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32 acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house –which was completed in 1802– the "Grange" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer for $25,000.[141] Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander Hamilton Jr.[141] The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial.[142][143][144]
Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. When the Academy received a college charter in 1812, the school was formally renamed Hamilton College. There is a prominent statue of Alexander Hamilton in front of the school's chapel (commonly referred to as the "Al-Ham" statue) and the Burke Library has an extensive collection of Hamilton's personal documents.
Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City. The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it. The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition. Columbia University's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the Alexander Hamilton Society.
The main administration building of the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, is named Hamilton Hall to commemorate Hamilton's creation of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, one of the predecessor services of the United States Coast Guard.
The U.S. Army's Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn is named after Hamilton. His country home, named "The Grange", is in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. It has been restored to its condition in 1802.[145]
A statue honoring Alexander Hamilton in Chicago was mired in controversy, at least concerning the surrounding architecture. Kate Sturges Buckingham (1858 – 1937), of the Buckingham Fountain family, commissioned the monument. Its impetus was that Treasury Secretary Hamilton "secured the nation's financial future and made it possible for her own family to make its fortune in grain elevators and banking. Consequently, John Angel was hired to model a figurative sculpture and the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen was to create a "colossal architectural setting" for it. The proposed 80-foot tall columned shelter was poorly received. By Ms. Buckingham's death in 1937, the sculpture's setting. location and design were uncertain. Conspiracy allegations surfaced, and the matter became mired in litigation. After the courts ordered the construction to be completed by 1953, the trustees hired architect Samuel A. Marx. The structure was completed, had structural problems, and was eventually demolished in 1993. The statue was gilded, and is still on display.[146]
A statue, by James Earle Fraser, was dedicated on May 17, 1923, on the south terrace of the Treasury Building, in Washington.
Hamilton's widow, Elizabeth (known as Eliza or Betsy), survived him for fifty years, until she died in Washington, D.C. in 1854; Hamilton referred to her as the "best of wives and best of women".[147] An extremely religious woman, Eliza spent much of her life working to help widows and orphans. She co-founded New York's first private orphanage, the New York Orphan Asylum Society.[148] Despite the Reynolds affair, Alexander and Eliza were very close, and especially grew closer afterwards.[147]
Hamilton and Elizabeth had eight children, including two named Phillip. The elder Philip, Hamilton's first child (born January 22, 1782), was killed in 1801 in a duel with George I. Eacker, whom he had publicly insulted in a Manhattan theater. The second Philip, Hamilton's last child, was born on June 2, 1802, right after the first Philip was killed. Their other children were Angelica, born September 25, 1784; Alexander, born May 16, 1796; James Alexander (April 14, 1788 – September 1878);[149] John Church, born August 22, 1792; William Stephen, born August 4, 1797; and Eliza, born November 26, 1799.[148]
Until recently the prevailing scholarly view was that Hamilton, like the Founders generally, lacked a deep concern about slavery. John Patrick Diggins traced this historians' animus against Hamilton to Vernon L. Parrington, who, writing in the 1920s to praise Jefferson and the Enlightenment, denounced a reactionary and unenlightened Hamilton as greedy and evil.[150] Sean Wilentz contends that the consensus has changed sharply in Hamilton's favor in recent years.[151] For example, Chan (2004) argues that the first U.S. Treasury Secretary was committed to ending slavery,[152] Chernow (2004) calls him "a fervent abolitionist",[153] Stewart (2008) states he was a "lifelong opponent of slavery",[154] and Braun (2010) says he "was a leading anti-slavery advocate".[155] Historian Manning Marable (2011) says Hamilton "vigorously opposed the slave trade and slavery's expansion."[156]
Hamilton's first polemic against King George's ministers contains a paragraph that speaks of the evils that "slavery" to the British would bring upon the Americans. McDonald sees this as an attack on the institution of slavery, David Hackett Fischer believes the term is used in a symbolic way at that time.[157][note 7]
During the Revolutionary War, Hamilton took the lead in proposals to arm slaves, free them, and compensate their masters. In 1779, Hamilton worked closely with his friend John Laurens of South Carolina to propose that such a unit be formed, under Laurens' command. Hamilton proposed to the Continental Congress to create up to four battalions of slaves for combat duty, and free them. Congress recommended that South Carolina (and Georgia) acquire up to three thousand slaves for service, if they saw fit. Although the South Carolina governor and Congressional delegation had supported the plan in Philadelphia, they did not implement it.[158] [note 8]
Hamilton argued that blacks' natural faculties were as good as those of free whites, and he warned that the British would arm the slaves if the patriots did not. In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable.[159] Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks.[160]
Hamilton, often in close association with his friend John Jay, was a leader in the anti-slavery movement in New York City following the Revolutionary War. They founded the New York Manumission Society to abolish the city's role in the international slave trade, and to pass legislation that would permanently end slavery in New York State. Both goals were accomplished by 1799.[161]
In January 1785, he attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president.[162] Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. He was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York.[163] In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina.[164]
Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries.[165] In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791—both measures hurt France.[166]
Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees).[167]
He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument.[167]
Hamilton is sometimes considered the "patron saint" of the American School of economic philosophy that, according to one historian, dominated economic policy after 1861.[168] He firmly supported government intervention in favor of business, after the manner of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, as early as the fall of 1781.[169]
Hamilton opposed the British ideas of free trade, which he believed skewed benefits to colonial and imperial powers, in favor of US protectionism, which he believed would help develop the fledgling nation's emerging economy. Henry C. Carey was inspired by his writings. Some say[who?] he influenced the ideas and work of the German Friedrich List.
From the 1860s onwards members of Japan's Meiji leadership, after touring America's post-Civil War political and industrial landscape, embraced Hamilton's words and work as being applicable to their own need to modernize. Within the Grant Administration they found Hamiltonian advocates who opened up American financial and manufacturing operations for Japanese inspection. The Meiji leadership sent their sons to study American finance and industry in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and other centers of commerce. These Japanese leaders found Hamilton's words and work also being used by Bismarck's administration in Germany, having been brought to Germany by Friedrich List in the 1840s after List had spent time in exile in Philadelphia. Later Hamilton's reports to Congress could be found in libraries not only in Japan but in Taiwan and Korea, after they came under the colonial rule of Meiji Japan. Post-1945 leaders in both countries (i.e., South Korea) used Hamilton's Report on Credit to establish their own modern financial systems [Austin. 2009].
Hamilton, as a youth in the West Indies, was an orthodox and conventional Presbyterian of the "New Light" evangelical type (as opposed to the "Old Light" Calvinists); he was being taught by a student of John Witherspoon, a moderate of the New School.[170] He wrote two or three hymns, which were published in the local newspaper.[171] Robert Troup, his college roommate, noted that Hamilton was "in the habit of praying on his knees night and morning."[172]
Gordon Wood says that Hamilton dropped his youthful religiosity during the Revolution and became, "a conventional liberal with theistic inclinations who was an irregular churchgoers at best"; however, he returned to religion in his last years.[173] Chernow says that, "Like Adams, Franklin, and Jefferson, Hamilton had probably fallen under the sway of deism, which sought to substitute reason for revelation and dropped the notion of an active God that will intervene in human affairs. At the same time, he never doubted God's existence, embracing Christianity as a system of morality and cosmic justice."[174][175] While Hamilton and the other founders could be considered deists in the sense that they embraced "rational religion", they were not deists in the sense of rejecting the idea of divine intervention.[176]
Hamilton made jokes about God at the Constitutional Convention.[177] During the French Revolution, he displayed an "opportunistic religiosity", using Christianity for political ends and insisting that Christianity and Jefferson's democracy were incompatible.[177] After 1801, Hamilton further asserted the truth of Christianity; he proposed a Christian Constitutional Society in 1802, to take hold of "some strong feeling of the mind" to elect "fit men" to office, and he wrote of "Christian welfare societies" for the poor. He was not a member of any denomination. After being shot, Hamilton spoke of his belief in God's mercy, and of his desire to renounce dueling; Bishop Moore administered communion to Hamilton.[note 9]
The first postage stamp to honor Hamilton was issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1870. The portrayals on the 1870 and 1888 issues are from the same engraved die, which was modeled after a bust of Hamilton by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi[178] The Hamilton 1870 issue was the first US Postage stamp to honor a Secretary of the Treasury. The three-cent red commemorative issue, which was released on the 200th anniversary of Hamilton's birth in 1957, includes a rendition of the Federal Hall building, located in New York City.[179]

=======================================================
Alexander Hamilton was born in Charlestown, Nevis, in the West Indies on January 11, 1757 (or 1755)*, to James Hamilton, a Scottish merchant of St. Christopher and Rachel Fawcett. (Note that 1757 is the year Hamilton claimed he was born; however, some experts believe he was born in 1755.) Rachel's father was a Huguenot physician and planter. She had previously been married to a Danish proprietor on St. Croix very young which ended in divorce — where the court then prohibited her remarriage. The marriage to James Hamilton was acceptable socially on Nevis (West Indies), but not elsewhere. The union resulted in the birth of two sons. It was not a very successful marriage either... they were living apart less than 10 years later. Rachel and her boys lived on St. Croix, dependent on her relatives. She passed away in 1768. His father survived until 1799 — but the boys were virtually orphans before they were even teenagers.
Alexander was educated early by his mother and as well as a presbyterian clergyman on St. Croix. He was employed at the age of 12 as a clerk in a general store and was found to be quite exceptionable in his job as well as in his writing. He could speak French fluently. He had a strong desire to go to college and by 1772, his aunts scrimped and saved to send him to New York.
He started school in Elizabethtown NJ, but by 1773 was entered at Kings College (Now Columbia). He was quite a mature young man, with a strong grasp on political issues with a working knowledge of British and American government which he exhibited in a series of anonymous pamphlets so discerning, they were attributed to John Jay. He was only 17 at the time.
In 1775, discontinuing his education, he founded a volunteer military company and on March 14, 1776, was commissioned Captain of the Provincial Company on New York Artillery. He exhibited great skill and intelligence in his duties with artillery, and Nathanael Greene noticed. (It may have been Greene who introduced Alexander Hamilton to George Washington). He was asked to serve on the staff of Lord Stirling, which he declined, and continued his career with the artillery effectively at Long Island, Harlem Heights, White Plains...as well as seeing action at Trenton and Princeton in the New Jersey campaign.
Washington recognized Hamilton's leadership abilities, as well as his writing ability. Hamilton was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and made his aide-de-camp on March 1, 1777. His position was one that could have hardly been achieved by an artillery commander — he was only twenty years old! Hamilton had embarked on a four and a half year career as a military secretary. He was an advisor to Washington, as well as an innovator of military design: he designed reports on the defects and how they could be improved in the military. It was here that his political thoughts and theories began to grow and take fruit.
Hamilton spent the winter of 1777-1778 with Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. It was during this winter that Brigadier General Horatio Gates tried unsuccessfully to incriminate Hamilton during the Conway Cabal.
On December 14, 1780, Alexander Hamilton married Elizabeth Schuyler — from a very wealthy and prominent New York family. It was a happy marriage that produced eight children. Supposedly, Washington and Hamilton had a "run-in" on February 16, 1781 which resulted in a "parting of the ways" for both men. Attempts at reconciliation were not successful, and Hamilton's wish was to simply continue his duties until a replacement could be found. Several months later, in July, Hamilton was given command of a battalion of Lafayette's Division in Moses Hazen's Brigade. He was quite successful in leading an attack at Yorktown and aided in the success of the surrender there. He continued in the military for a couple of years when he was made Colonel on September 30, 1783. He left the service by the end of the year.
His career path turned down the road to politics. He spent a year in Congress from 1782-1783 and then spent time working as a lawyer in New York. At the Convention in Annapolis, Maryland in 1786, he authored a draft of a report which resulted in the Constitutional Convention a year later. He also authored more than half of the Federalist papers, while being an advocate for a strong central government and working towards seeing the Constitution ratified. He became an important member of the first Cabinet of the first President as the first Secretary of the Treasury (1789-1795). The financial situation of the country after the Revolution was the primary problem facing the new nation, and Hamilton developed the "Hamiltonian system". He became a leader in the Federalist Party (advocates of a strong central/federal government). The Democrat-Republican Party, more commonly known as the "Republicans", were their opponents, was led by Thomas Jefferson.
After this, Hamilton's career was not very illustrious. It seems that Hamilton was guilty of exposing Cabinet secrets to Major George Beckwith from Britain (who was involved with Benedict Arnold in his treason). Hamilton was very deceptive and dishonorable in his dealings with other government officials, discrediting some of his contemporaries in order to see that his plans, ideas and policies were successful. The ideas of other visionaries like Thomas Jefferson were doomed to failure as a result. In their correspondence, George Beckwith referred to Hamilton as "Number 7" in order to enshroud their dealings in secrecy. Other people involved in the affair were Senator William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut and Philip Schuyler, Hamilton's father-in-law from New York.
Hamilton resigned at the end of January in 1795, primarily because he found he could not live off of his $3,500 salary. He returned to the practice of law, mainly cases relating to money/commerce and insurance, which brought him $12,000 a year. He remained an advisor to Washington, even aiding the writing of his Farewell Address, but he did not render civil service to his country again. He was instrumental, however in the elections of 1796 as a leader of the Federalist Party. His dealings permanently alienated John Adams. Hamilton urged the other Federalist party members to vote for Thomas Pinckney as Vice-President, hoping that Presidential hopeful John Adams would become Vice-President and Pinckney would become President. The plan backfired and ultimately Thomas Jefferson became Vice-President and Thomas Pinckney did not fit into either role. Taking on a different tactic, Hamilton tried to exert his influence over the new secretary of State, Timothy Pickering and secretary of Treasury, Oliver Wolcott in Adams' new Cabinet. He was successful until the President discovered his dealings and reorganized his cabinet.
In July of 1798, Hamilton was commissioned Major General when war threatened to break out with France. He served once more in the military for almost two years. His feud with Adams exploded in 1800 when Hamilton an attack on Adams' presidency was published. He worked furiously in the elections of 1800, but both Federalist candidates were defeated. When Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson tied in the elections that year, Hamilton cast his influence in his political party to Thomas Jefferson which was stupefying in the fact that Hamilton disliked Jefferson more than he disliked John Adams! Four years later, he helped defeat the Burr campaign once more when Burr tried to become governor of New York.
Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton had been on friendly terms for years, but after fifteen years of having every political aspiration thwarted by Hamilton, Burr was seething with anger and itching for revenge. When Burr read statements published by Hamilton to the effect of: he is "a dangerous man and one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government", it was the final straw. Ultimately, Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel. On July 11, 1804, Hamilton was mortally wounded and he died the following afternoon in extreme pain at the age of 47.
* Hamilton was born on January 11, but the year is uncertain. Hamilton claimed that 1757 was his birth year when he first arrived from Nevis. However, probate papers filed upon his mother's death assert that he was 13 at the time, making his birth year 1755. Hamilton himself was vague about his age throughout his life.

Alexander Hamilton was the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Read this brief biography & timeline to explore his life, childhood & political career.
Works & Achievements: First U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Co-author of The Federalist Papers, First New York delegate chosen to the Constitutional Convention
Alexander Hamilton was one of the important pioneers in the early formation of the American government. He participated in Washington's Revolutionary War from 1777 to 1781. After the war, Hamilton co-wrote the famous 'Federalist' Papers with John Jay and James Madison, which served as a primary source for Constitutional interpretation. Hamilton signed his essays as 'Publius'. President Washington appointed Hamilton as the country's first Secretary of the Treasury in 1789. He held this post until 1795. Alexander Hamilton was a man of great intelligence and ambition.
There are disputes regarding Alexander Hamilton's birth date. In the probate court papers from St. Croix, a relative, Peter Lytton, stated that when his mother died, Hamilton was only 13 years old. This indicates 1755 as the year of his birth. However, throughout his life, Hamilton identified 1757 as his birth year. Till date, the matter has not been resolved, as no birth or christening records have been found to confirm or deny either of the two birth years. Hamilton was born in Charlestown, the capital of Nevis in the British West Indies, to Rachel Faucett Lavien and James Hamilton.
Hamilton's had previously escaped an unhappy marriage, when she separated from Johann Michael Lavien (and her first-born son as well). Later on, Rachel met James, in the year 1750. As she had inherited property from her father in Nevis, they moved together to Rachel's birthplace, where Hamilton was born. He also had a brother - James Jr. In 1765, Hamilton's family moved to Christiansted, St. Croix, because of his father's business assignment. Sometime after reaching there, James dumped Rachel as well as his two sons. Following this, Rachel started working in a small store in Christiansted, to support her family.
Rachel died of a severe fever on February 19, 1768. After becoming an orphan, Hamilton started working as a clerk at Beekman and Cruger, a local import-export firm that traded with New England. In 1771, while the owner of his firm was at sea, Hamilton was left in charge for five months. Some time later, Hamilton was adopted by a Nevis merchant, Thomas Stevens. However, he continued working as a clerk. While he continued to be an avid reader, it was around this time only that he developed an interest in writing as well.
Initially, Alexander Hamilton was denied education in the church school, because his parents were not legally married. So, he had self-educated himself, with the help of a family library of thirty-four books, including Greek and Roman classics. He also developed a command on French language, after learning the language from his mother. However, in 1772, Hamilton received education from a grammar school in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. He studied with Francis Barber at Elizabethtown in 1773. He then decided to attend King's College (now Columbia University), in New York City, getting a Bachelor’s of Arts degree in just one year.
In 1775, Alexander Hamilton joined a New York volunteer militia company, called the 'Hearts of Oak', which included other students from King's College. He studied military history and tactics and achieved the rank of lieutenant in the company. He led a successful raid for British cannon in the Battery, capturing it. In 1776, Hamilton raised the New York Provincial Company of Artillery, which consisted of sixty men, through his connections with influential patriots of New York, like Alexander McDougall and John Jay.
Hamilton was later elected as the captain of New York Provincial Company of Artillery. He was offered to serve on the staff of Lord Stirling, but declined and decided to carry on his career with the artillery effectively. In the hopes of obtaining a place on Washington's staff, Hamilton declined to become an aide to Nathanael Greene and other generals. In late 1776, he joined Washington's aide as a Lieutenant Colonel. Later, he became Washington's Chief of Staff and served in the capacity for four years.
Hamilton soon become one of Washington's most trusted advisers and his responsibilities included drafting letters to Congress, state governors, and the most powerful generals in the Continental Army. He had power to issue orders from Washington under his own signature. Working with Washington Staff, Hamilton performed a variety of high-level duties, such as intelligence, diplomacy, and negotiation. In February 1781, Hamilton resigned from his post. In the same year, Washington gave him the command of a battalion of light infantry in the Marquis de Lafayette's corps.
While still serving On Washington's staff, Alexander Hamilton became frustrated with the wartime Continental Congress and the fact that was dependent upon the states for financial support and ended up resigning his commission. In November 1782, Hamilton was elected to the Congress of the Confederation, as a New York representative. While he was there, several Congressmen from that area, including Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, James Wilson, and James Madison, were trying to provide the Congress with an independent source of revenue, which it lacked under the Articles of Confederation.
While Hamilton was still in Congress, most of the army was posted at Newburgh, New York, paying for its own supplies. The dissatisfied soldiers, who had not been paid in eight months, began to pose a danger to the young United States. After Valley Forge, in May 1778, the Continental officers had been promised, a pension of half their pay, after they were discharged. A group of officers at Newburgh organized under the leadership of General Henry Knox and sent a delegation to lobby Congress. Their three demands were: the Army's pay, their own pensions and the commutation of pensions into a lump-sum payment.
Hamilton and other congressmen decided to use the event, to gain support for funding for the federal government in Congress and from the states. He also proposed national funding system. However, the plan was not successful. In April 1783, Congress ordered the officially disbanding of the Army. In the same month, a new measure for a twenty-five-year impost was passed by the Congress and Hamilton voted against it. Perturbed and annoyed at the weakness of the central government, Hamilton drafted a call to revise the Articles of Confederation while in Princeton.
Alexander Hamilton resigned from the Congress in July 1783. Following this, he began a law practice in New York City. In 1784, he founded the Bank of New York (the oldest ongoing banking organization in the United States till date). Hamilton was one of the men who restored King's College, which had been severely damaged in 1776 - during the Battle of Long Island, as Columbia College. While attending the Annapolis Convention in 1786, as a delegate, he drafted its resolution for a Constitutional convention, in which he desired to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government.
In 1787, Hamilton was the first New York delegate chosen to the Constitutional Convention. He also served as assemblyman in the New York State Legislature, but his influence was quite limited. The other two delegates of the New York legislature, along with Hamilton, were John Lansing and Robert Yates and both of them opposed his goal of a strong national government. His most important speech in the Convention called for a new government in United States, which seemed to other delegates as 'monarchial' and was unacceptable to most of them. Hamilton constructed a draft for the Constitution during the convention, on the basis of the convention debates, but these drafts were never presented.
According to Hamilton's draft, the Senate was to be elected in proportion to population and it had to be two-fifth to the size of the House. He also proposed that the President and Senators be elected through multistage elections, in which chosen electors would elect smaller bodies of electors. They would hold office for life, but could be removed for misconduct. The Supreme Court was to have immediate authority over all law suits involving the United States. Last, but not the least, Hamilton's draft required that State governors be appointed by the federal government. Though he was not too impressed with the final form of constitution, he signed it and urged other delegates to do the same.
In 1787, Hamilton decided to write a series of essays on behalf of the proposed Constitution. He wrote 51 of them and got 29 written by Madison and 5 by Jay. These essays were first published in New York City newspapers, under the pseudonym "Publius", and later collectively called 'The Federalist Papers'. These essays were designed to convince the people of New York to ratify the Constitution. In 1788, these essays were published in the book form. Later, 'The Federalist Papers' were republished in many editions and languages. Today, they constitute one of America's most original and important contributions to political philosophy
On September 11, 1789, Hamilton was appointed the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, by George Washington and held the post till January 1795. In 1790-91, he submitted five reports. The first Report was on the Public Credit, which was communicated to the House of Representatives on January 14, 1790. In this report, Hamilton made a proposal that the federal government should assume state debts which were sustained during the Revolution. The proposal faced several controversies and criticism.
Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Representative James Madison criticized 'Public Credit' by arguing that the plan has passed beyond the scope of the new Constitutional government. In the end, Hamilton's proposals for funding the debt overcame legislative opposition and were passed on July 26, 1790. Hamilton's second report was 'Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports', which was communicated to the House of Representatives on April 23, 1790. On December 14, 1790 Hamilton submitted 'Second Report on Public Credit', a Report on a National Bank.
The fourth report submitted by Hamilton was on the 'Establishment of a Mint', communicated on January 28, 1791 (He later helped in founding the United States Mint, such as the first national bank, a System of Cutters - forming the Revenue Cutter Service that is now known as the United States Coast Guard, and an elaborate system of duties, tariffs, and excises. This whole program was aim at replacing the messy financial system of the confederation, with a modern system that gave financial stability to the new government and sufficient confidence to investors to invest in government bonds (the aim was successful).
The fifth, and the last report of Hamilton, was on 'Manufactures', which he communicated to the House of Representatives on December 5, 1791. Without much debate, Congress rejected this report. Hamilton also submitted other significant reports while serving as the U.S. Secretary of State, many of which Congress accepted. One of the reports included a plan for an excise tax on whiskey, which became the main reason for Whiskey Rebellion in 1794.
During his term as the U.S. Secretary of State, Hamilton was repeatedly investigated for some of the most serious charges, such as the Reynolds affair. In 1790, he was involved in an incident, in which the money that Congress had appropriated to pay the European creditors of the United States was used by Hamilton, towards his domestic expenditure.Hamilton was not able to provide any evidence against this charge, proving his innocence. He tried to give excuse by saying that he had been authorized to act so, by Washington.
When consulted Washington was confronted in this context, he could not remember the transaction and simply preferred to remain away from the case.Hamilton was very angry with Washington that he was trusted unconditionally and resigned as Secretary of the Treasury, on December 1, 1794. Hamilton's resignation as Secretary of the Treasury became effective in 1795.Even after that, he remained close to Washington and his family, mainly as an adviser and a friend.
In his last years, Alexander Hamilton worked as a Prominent Lawyer and Army General. Hamilton also established a daily newspaper, New-York Evening Post, in the year 1801 (the oldest continually-published daily newspaper in the U.S., now known as the New York Post). It was with the help of Hamilton that Morgan Lewis defeated Burr, in the election in New York, in 1804. This proved to be the reason of a conflict between Hamilton and Burr. On July 11, 1804, the two exchanged shots, on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, leaving Hamilton mortally wounded. Being fatally injured, Hamilton died the next afternoon.
On December 14, 1780 Hamilton married Elizabeth Schuyler at Schuyler Mansion in Albany, New York. She was daughter of General Philip Schuyler. After marrying Elizabeth, Hamilton became member of one of the richest and most political families in the state of New York. They had eight children - Phillip, Angelica, Alexander, James Alexander, John Church, William Stephen, Eliza and Phillip. In 1791, he became involved in an affair with Maria Reynolds, the wife of James Reynolds. The affair badly damaged his reputation for the rest of his life. Hamilton's wife Elizabeth survived him for fifty years, until 1854.
By formulating federal programs, Hamilton set an example as a Cabinet member. Another legacy of Hamilton was his pro-federal interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. As a Secretary of the Treasury, he established the country's first national bank, against the intense opposition of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.During the Cuban Missile Crisis, in 1962, the Navy of the United States used the intership communication protocols that Hamilton had written for the original U.S. Coast Guard. His constitutional interpretation of the 'Necessary and Proper Clause' is still used by the courts and is considered as an authority on constitutional interpretation.
Hamilton's portrait began to appear on U.S. currency, by the time of the American Civil War. It could be seen on the notes of US $2, $5, $10, and $50. Even after the Civil War, his face continues to appear on the US $10 bill, in the form of John Trumbull's portrait. It was picked up from the portrait collection of New York City Hall. Hamilton can also be seen on the $500 Series EE Savings Bond. A statue of Hamilton can be seen on the south side of the Treasury Building in Washington, D.C.
Hamilton's upper Manhattan home has been preserved as Hamilton Grange National Memorial, with his statue adorning its entrance. There are many towns throughout the United States, which have been named after him. Alexander Hamilton was one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy. The school was formally renamed as Hamilton College in 1812. In front of the school's chapel, one can find a big statue of Alexander Hamilton, which is commonly referred to as the "Al-Ham" statue.
An extensive collection of Hamilton's personal documents can be found in the Burke Library. In Columbia College,the main classroom building for humanities is referred to as the 'Hamilton Hall' and has a prominent statue of Hamilton stands in the front. Hamilton's complete works have been published in a multivolume letterpress edition, by the university press. Last, but not the least, the main administration building of the Coast Guard Academy has been named Hamilton Hall, in the memory of great man.
