Penn Fraser Jillette (born March 5, 1955) is an American illusionist, comedian, musician, inventor, actor, and best-selling author known for his work with fellow magician Teller in the team Penn & Teller. He is also known for his advocacy of atheism, scientific skepticism, libertarianism and free-market capitalism.
Jillette was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts. His mother, Valda R. Jillette (née Parks; 1909–2000),[2] was a secretary, and his father, Samuel Herbert Jillette (1912–1999),[2] worked at Greenfield's Franklin County Jail.[3][4][5] Penn became an atheist in his early teens after reading the Bible and was subsequently asked to leave the church after asking questions in a youth group that also made skeptics of his peers.[6] Jillette became disenchanted with traditional illusionist acts that presented the craft as authentic magic, such as The Amazing Kreskin on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. At age eighteen, he saw a show by illusionist James Randi, and became enamored of his approach to magic that openly acknowledged deception as entertainment rather than a mysterious supernatural power. Jillette regularly acknowledges Randi as the one person on the planet he loves the most besides members of his family.
Jillette worked with high school classmate Michael Moschen in developing and performing a juggling act during the years immediately following their 1973 graduation.[5] In 1974, Jillette graduated from Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College.[7] That same year, he was introduced to Teller by Weir Chrisemer, a mutual friend.[8] The three then formed a three-person act called Asparagus Valley Cultural Society which played in Amherst and San Francisco.[5] In 1981, he and Teller teamed up as Penn & Teller, and went on to do a successful Off Broadway and later Broadway theatre show called "Penn & Teller" that toured nationally.[5]
In 1994 Jillette purchased a house in Las Vegas and dubbed it "The Slammer".[9] It has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers. He currently records music there, and previously conducted his radio show at the studio inside "The Slammer".[10][11]
While the off Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Penn was in a speed mariachi power trio called Bongos, Bass and Bob (Penn played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal and guitar was by Rob (Bob) Elk (Running Elk). The last two became the a capella comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after Bongos Bass and Bob broke up due to Penn's movie commitments. They recorded a record with Kramer at Noise New York called "Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here's Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?)" which was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in Spin Magazine. but was immortalized with a clay-mation video of the hit single Oral Hygiene.
Jillette was also a regular contributor to the now-defunct PC/Computing magazine in the early 1990s, having a regular back section column between 1990 and 1994. True to form, the columns were often as much about Uma Thurman as actual PC computing issues. Jillette and PC Computing parted ways over a dispute with a new editor. Jillette felt the new editor was trying to tell him how to write his column and what topics he should be covering. Jillette asserts that he is unsure if he was fired or if he actually quit.
Jillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network Comedy Central in the 1990s.[12][13]
Starting in 1996, he had a recurring role on Sabrina, the Teenage Witch as Drell, the head of the Witches' Council. He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with Debbie Harry as the third member of the Council. The show was created by Jillette's friend Nell Scovell.
Penn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th season episode of Babylon 5, "The Day of the Dead", written by Neil Gaiman.
For a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the search engine Excite.com. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the Penn & Teller duo he was. (For example: "Penn Jillette is the half of Penn & Teller that's detained at airports.") Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. The columns are no longer available on the current Excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at PennAndTeller.com.[14]
Starting in 2003, Jillette, along with his partner Teller, began producing and hosting the show Penn & Teller: Bullshit! on Showtime. In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem "bullshit".
In 2005 with actor Paul Provenza, Jillette co-produced and co-directed The Aristocrats (2005), a documentary film tracing the life of a dirty joke known as "The Aristocrats".
From January 3, 2006 to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow atheist, skeptic, and juggler Michael Goudeau, a live, hour-long radio talk show broadcast on the radio station brand known as Free FM. The show, Penn Radio, broadcast from his Vintage Nudes Studio in Jillette's Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was "Monkey Tuesday" and later "The Pull of the Weasel". On March 2, 2007, Jillette, on Free FM, announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a "show biz wimp" and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his kids Zolten Penn Jillette and Moxie CrimeFighter Jillette.
During the 2006–07 television season, Jillette hosted the prime time game show "Identity" on NBC-TV.
In 2008, Jillette was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, paired with professional dancer Kym Johnson. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated. A reference to his large feet as a sign of another large body part was bleeped in the West Coast airing.[citation needed]
In 2009, Jillette did a spoken guest appearance on a song by Pakistani rapper Adil Omar. The song was titled "Spookshow" and produced by DJ Solo of Soul Assassins. The lyrics condemn religious extremism and encourage skepticism. It is set to be featured on a compilation album by Thick Syrup Records alongside artists like Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Half Japanese and more.[citation needed]
On May 24, 2010, Jillette began a bi-weekly show on Revision3 called Penn Point. It is currently on hiatus. The last update was posted on October 26, 2011.[15]
On August 16, 2011 Jillette's book God, No! Signs You May Already Be An Atheist and Other Magical Tales was released and made the New York Times Best Sellers in its first week of publication.
An avid upright bassist, Penn frequently accompanies jazz pianist Mike Jones, who opens for the magician's Las Vegas show.[16]
Jillette was one of the contestants on The Celebrity Apprentice season 5, beginning on February 19, 2012. He was fired from the show by Donald Trump during the Week 11 episode. In 2013, he returned for the All-Star Celebrity Apprentice season, where he successfully made his way to the finale, raising a total of $663,655 for the charity of his choice Opportunity Village. Also on February 19, 2012, along with Michael Goudeau, he started the podcast Penn's Sunday School.
On April 5, 2013 Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to Harry Houdini.[17] The following day they were recognized by the Magic Castle with the "Magicians of the Year" award.[17]
In July 1999, Jillette was granted U.S. Patent 5,920,923 for the "Jill-Jet", a hot-tub jet specially angled for a woman's pleasure. He has credited Debbie Harry of Blondie for suggesting the idea, as the two of them were once in a hot-tub and Harry made a remark about changing the jets for a woman's pleasure. Jillette liked the idea enough to pursue patent application at the USPTO under the patent title "Hydro-therapeutic stimulator".[18] The abstract of the patent explains that a "discharge nozzle is located within the tub and connected to the outlet, mounted to the seat so that the discharged water from the circulation pump automatically aligns with and is directed to stimulation points (e.g., the clitoris) of the female user when the female user sits in the seat." An article in the June 2006 issue of Playboy shed additional light on the invention. Originally, it was to be called the "ClitJet"; however, he stated that "Jill-Jet" was more suitable because it included his name in the title.
On the Penn Radio show, telling the listeners about the photo shoot for the Playboy article, Jillette mentioned that he has a Jill-Jet installed in a tub at "The Slammer", and that several of his female friends and friends' spouses enjoy it a lot, but he is not aware of any other installations of a water jet in such a configuration anywhere else.
Jillette created a private recording studio in his Las Vegas home.[19] The addition, designed by Outside The Lines Studio and built by Crisci Custom Builders between October 2003 and June 2004 as part of his Las Vegas home,[20] was named Vintage Nudes Studios by Jillette for playing cards that he had collected. The cards are displayed in the interior design in a manner which is meaningful to magicians.[21] The studio was home to Free FM's Penn Radio show, and is currently the home of the Penn's Sunday School stream and podcast.[19][22]
Jillette is married to Emily Zolten and has a daughter named Moxie CrimeFighter Jillette, and a son, named Zolten Penn Jillette.
He says he has never used recreational drugs or alcohol. He is, however, an advocate of the legalization of all drugs and discontinuing the War on Drugs.[23]
Jillette is an atheist, libertarian (he has stated that he may consider himself to be an anarcho-capitalist),[24] and skeptic, as well as an adherent to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy, as stated on his Penn Says podcast. Jillette is a Fellow at the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, and has stated that he "always" votes Libertarian.[25] In January 2007, Jillette took the "Blasphemy Challenge" offered by the Rational Response Squad and publicly denied the existence of a holy spirit.[26] His cars' license plates read "atheist", "nogod", and "godless".[27] "Strangely enough, they wouldn't give me 'Infidel,'" he says.[27]
In 2005 he wrote and read an essay for National Public Radio claiming that he was "beyond atheism. Atheism is not believing in God ... I believe there is no God."[28] His atheism, he has explained, has informed every aspect of his life and thoughts, and as such is as crucial to him as theistic beliefs are to the devout. Jillette welcomes and even encourages open discussion, debate, and proselytizing on the issue of God's existence, believing that the issue is too important for opinions about it to remain private. Jillette does not, however, dismiss all who do believe in God: A 2008 edition of his Penn Says podcast expresses his appreciation for a fan who brought him the gift of a pocket Gideon Bible after a performance because he realized that this individual sincerely cared enough about him to try to help him.[29]
Jillette has stated that there is not enough information to make an informed decision on global warming, and that it is an emotion versus logic issue.[30]
Speculation arises from Jillette's red fingernail on his left hand. From a FAQ from Penn & Teller's official website, there are three common answers:
When Jillette first began performing, his mother told him to get a manicure because people would be looking at his hands. In response to this, he had all of his nails painted red as a joke. The one remaining red fingernail is in memory of his mother.[35]
Although, in several posts on Twitter in direct response to questions about his red fingernail, Penn states "People are asking about my fingernail. Wear my Dad's ring and my Mom's nail polish. Just for remembrance and respect."[36]
During his appearance on the Chopped Tournament of Stars (2014), he effectively told the story of his mother suggesting he get a manicure for the reasons stated above, and said that he kept it in respect for her.

=======================================================
Penn & Teller (Penn Jillette and Teller) are American illusionists and entertainers who have performed together since the late 1970s, noted for their ongoing act which combines elements of comedy with magic. The duo, having been featured in numerous stage and television shows, currently headline a show in Las Vegas at The Rio. Penn Jillette serves as the act's orator and raconteur. Teller, however, generally does not speak while performing, and instead communicates through mime and nonverbals, although his voice can occasionally be heard during their show. Besides magic, the pair have recently become associated with their advocacy of atheism, scientific skepticism, and libertarianism, particularly through their television show Penn & Teller: Bullshit!.
Penn Jillette and Teller were introduced to one another by Wier Chrisimer, and performed their first show together at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival on 19 August 1975.[1] From the late 1970s through 1981, Penn, Teller, and Chrisimer performed as a trio called "The Asparagus Valley Cultural Society" which played in San Francisco at the Phoenix Theater. Chrisimer helped to develop some bits that continued, most notably Teller's "Shadows" trick, which involves a single red rose.[citation needed] The group disbanded in 1981 after Chrisimer quit show business, leaving Penn Jillette and Teller to work as a pair.
By 1985, Penn & Teller were receiving positive reviews for their Off Broadway show and Emmy Award-winning PBS special, Penn & Teller Go Public.[2] In 1987, they began the first of two successful Broadway runs. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, the duo made numerous television appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and Saturday Night Live, as well as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Today, and many others.
Penn & Teller had national tours throughout the 1990s, gaining critical praise. They have also made television guest appearances on Babylon 5[3] (as the comedy team Rebo and Zooty), The Drew Carey Show, a few episodes of Hollywood Squares from 1998 until 2004, ABC's Muppets Tonight, FOX's The Bernie Mac Show, an episode of the game show Fear Factor on NBC, NBC's The West Wing, in a two-part episode of the final season of ABC's Home Improvement in 1998, four episodes during season 1 of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch in 1996, NBC's Las Vegas, and Fox's The Simpsons episodes "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder" and "The Great Simpsina" and the Futurama film Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder in 2009. They also appeared as three-card Monte scam artists in the music video for "It's Tricky" by Run-DMC in 1987, and were thrown out of a Las Vegas hotel room in the music video for "Waking Up in Vegas" by Katy Perry in 2009.
Their Showtime network television show Bullshit! took a skeptical look at psychics, religion, the pseudoscientific, conspiracy theories, and the paranormal. It has featured critical segments on gun control, astrology, Feng Shui, environmental issues, PETA, weight loss, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the war on drugs.
They have also described themselves as teetotalers. Their book, Penn & Teller's How to Play in Traffic, explains that they avoid alcohol, drugs, and caffeine, though they do appear to smoke cigarettes in some videos.
The pair have written several books about magic, including Penn & Teller's Cruel Tricks For Dear Friends, Penn & Teller's How to Play with Your Food, and Penn & Teller's How to Play in Traffic. Since 2001, Penn & Teller have performed six nights a week (or as Penn put it on Bullshit!: "Every night of the week ... except Fridays!") in Las Vegas at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino.
Penn Jillette hosted a weekday one-hour talk show on Infinity Broadcasting's Free FM radio network from January 3, 2006 to March 2, 2007 with cohost Michael Goudeau.[4][5] He also hosted the game show Identity, which debuted on December 18, 2006 on NBC.
Their television series Penn & Teller Tell a Lie premiered on the Discovery Channel on October 5, 2011.
Penn & Teller have also shown support for the Brights movement[6] and are now listed on the movement's homepage under the Enthusiastic Brights section.[7] According to an article in Wired magazine, their license plates are customized so they read, "Atheist" and "Godless", and when Penn signs autographs, he sometimes writes "there is no God" with his signature.[8]
Penn Jillette has told interviewer Larry King[when?] that a big part of the duo's success and longevity is due to them never having been close friends. They respect each other as business partners and enjoy working together, but have little in common besides magic. As a result of their drastically different lifestyles and interests, they rarely socialize or interact when not working. Jillette believes[citation needed] that their partnership succeeds precisely because they give each other a great deal of space off-stage.
Penn later amended this position in a video where he and Teller responded to questions from members of Reddit and also in a video interview for Big Think, stating that while they share few similar interests outside magic, Teller is his best friend and that his children treat him as a close relative. He states that while most entertainment partnerships such as Martin and Lewis and Lennon and McCartney were based on a deep affection for each other that lends to a certain volatility when things go wrong, their business relationship and friendship is based on a respect for each other.[9][10]
On April 5, 2013 they were honored with the 2,494th star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their achievement in the category of their career spanning over 35 years Live Performance. The star is few steps away from the star of Houdini and down the street from The Magic Castle.[11][12][13]
Penn and Teller's material varies from light-hearted gags such as gory tricks and clever pranks, to tackling issues through political satire and by exposing frauds. Many of their effects rely heavily on shock appeal and fantasy violence, although presented in a humorous manner. Some of their more daring tricks include Teller hanging upside-down over a cushion of spikes in a straitjacket, Teller submerged in a huge container of water, Teller being run over by an 18-wheel tractor-trailer, and Teller swinging through Penn's hands.
Sometimes, the pair will claim to reveal a secret of how a magic trick is done, but those tricks are usually invented by the duo for the sole purpose of exposing them, and therefore designed with more spectacular and weird methods than would have been necessary had it just been a "proper" magic trick. For example, in the "reveal" of one trick, while Teller waits for his cue, he reads magazines and eats a snack.[clarification needed] Another example is their rendition of the cups and balls, using transparent cups.
Penn and Teller perform their own adaptation of the famous bullet catch illusion. Each simultaneously fires a gun at the other through small panes of glass and then "catches" the other's bullet in his mouth. They also have an assortment of card tricks in their repertoire, virtually all of them involving the force of the Three of Clubs on an unsuspecting audience member as this card is easy for viewers to identify on television cameras.[14]
The duo will sometimes perform tricks that discuss the intellectual underpinnings of magic. One of their routines, titled "Magician vs. Juggler", features Teller performing card tricks while Penn juggles and delivers a monologue on the difference between the two: jugglers start as socially aware children who go outside and learn juggling with other children; magicians are misfits who stay in the house and teach themselves magic tricks out of spite.
In one of their most politically charged tricks, they make an American flag seem to disappear by wrapping it in a copy of the United States Bill of Rights, and apparently setting the flag on fire, so that "the flag is gone but the Bill of Rights remains." The routine may also feature the "Chinese bill of rights", presented as a transparent piece of acetate. They normally end the trick by restoring the unscathed flag to its starting place on the flagpole; however, on a TV guest appearance on The West Wing this final part was omitted.[15]
One of their more recent tricks[16] involves a powered nail gun with a quantity of missing nails from the series of nails in its magazine. Penn begins by firing several apparently real nails into a board in front of him. He then proceeds to fire the nail gun into the palm of his hand several times, while suffering no injuries. His pattern builds as he oscillates between firing blanks into his hand and firing nails into the board, and fires one blank into Teller's crotch. Near the end of the trick he says it is a trick and that he and Teller believe that it is morally wrong to do things on stage that are really dangerous—it makes the audience complicit in unnecessary human risk.[17]
A trick introduced in 2010 is a modern version of the bag escape, replacing the traditional sack with a black trash bag apparently filled with helium. Teller is placed in the bag which is then pumped full of helium and sealed by an audience member. For the escape, the audience is blinded by a bright light for a second and when they are able to see again, Teller has escaped from the bag and Penn is holding it, still full of helium, above his head, before releasing it to float to the ceiling. The duo had hoped to put the trick in their mini-tour in London; however, it was first shown to the public in their Las Vegas show on 18 August 2010. In June 2011, Penn and Teller performed this trick for the first time in the United Kingdom on their ITV show Fool Us.[18]
On Bullshit!, the duo described their social and political views as libertarian. In addition to paranormal and pseudo-scientific claims, Penn & Teller take a skeptical view of government authority.[19] In various episodes of their show they have heavily criticized both the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as taken stances against prohibitions on guns, drugs, tobacco, prostitution, nuclear energy, nudity, and profanity. Penn & Teller are both H.L. Mencken research fellows with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.[20][21]

The 1995 video game Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors featured a mini-game called Desert Bus in which the player drove a bus route between Tucson and Las Vegas. Once reaching the destination, the player gets one point and, if desired, can then drive the return route. The game was considered by some [25] to be long and boring, but found a cult audience.[26]
The game has since been used in an annual charity event called "Desert Bus for Hope" run by the website desertbus.org. The site invites celebrities to play the game streamed live online, with all proceeds being donated to Child's Play. On November 14, 2011 an iOS port of Desert Bus was created and released in the iTunes Store. The game was developed in conjunction with the Desert Bus For Hope event and all profits from the game are donated to charity.[citation needed]
"Penn and Teller: New(kd) Las Vegas 3D", was a 2012 Halloween Horror Nights maze collaborated at Universal Orlando. It featured a backstory of Las Vegas being destroyed by Penn and Teller's latest magic trick involving a nuclear warhead gone wrong.[27]

      Jokes that the reason for him painting his fingernail is because he "Shot a man for asking him personal questions!". The real reason is that it is a joke between him and his mother.

      [on his son's name] Zolten is a common Hungarian name, it's my wife's maiden name and most importantly, it's the name of Dracula's dog.
      [on the environment, June 20, 2008] Every bit of my bullshit detector goes off like crazy over global warming, and every fucking thing Al Gore says. He seems to me like a lying sack of shit who's wrong about everything.
      There are magic tricks that look astonishing, and that - if you knew the secret - you would think are a little easy. Magic strips that out in an almost burlesque caricature way: to conceal how it's put together.. When someone in music plays an effortless riff - when you hear John Coltrane play something that just flows out of the sax easily and comfortably - the fact that he was doing tedious work to get there is supposed to disappear, exactly the same as a magic trick.

Has served as the announcer for Comedy Central, host for the TV game show Identity and host of a national radio program.  
Unlike other traditional magic acts, Penn explains how the tricks are done afterward, as he feels it's more honest. 
Along with Teller, Penn is a visiting scholar at MIT and received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in 2001. 
In 2009, he did a spoken-word appearance on "Spookshow," a song by Pakistani rapper Adil Omar that condemned religious extremism. 
His ice-cream creation, Vanilla and Chocolate Magic Swirtle, went on sale in 2013.Penn Jillette Relationships: Moxie Crimefighter Jillette - DaughterZolten Penn Jillette - SonEmily Zolten - WifePenn Jillette Awards: 2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Reality Program - Nominee2013 BAFTA Film Awards:  Best Documentary - Nominee2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming - Nominee2005 Emmy:  Outstanding Reality Program - Nominee1999 Emmy:  Outstanding Music and Lyrics - Nominee2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Reality Program - Nominee2004 Emmy:  Outstanding Reality Program - Nominee2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming - Nominee2004 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming - Nominee2005 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming - NomineeCollege: Attended Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College, Venice, FL

Comedian, illusionist, juggler and writer Penn Fraser Jillette was born March 5, 1955 in Greenfield, Massachusetts.  When he was 18, he had the chance to watch a show by illusionist James Randi and was immediately fascinated with Randi's style.  Jillette strongly believes in Randi's philosophy that magic is an entertainment and not a mysterious supernatural power.In 1973, he and high school classmate Michael Moschen worked in juggling acts.  After graduating from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College, he met magician Raymond Joseph Teller through common friend Weir Chisimer.  The three got along well and eventually formed Asparagus Valley Cultural Society, a three-person act.  Later on, he and Teller formed the famous comedy magic duo Penn & Teller, where Jillette became the talkative half.  In 2003, they produced and hosted the Emmy-nominated documentary TV series Penn & Teller: Bullshit!  The show's episodes focused on debunking supernatural beliefs, myths, popular fads and misconceptions. Jillette is a Fellow at the Cato Institute H.L. Mencken Research.  Aside from being a comedian and an illusionist, he's also a bass guitarist and a double bassist.  He is also fond of composing songs.In 2005, he was co-producer and co-director for the documentary film The Aristocrats.  It focused on tracking down the source of a dirty joke with the same title.  The documentary was a tribute for Johnny Carson because “The Aristocrats” was his favorite joke.Penn Jillette soon became a celebrity contestant on season 6 of ABC's reality series Dancing with the Stars. He is paired with professional dancer Kym Johnson . Unfortunately, he was the first to be sent home. He then released a book in 2011, titled " God, No! Signs You May Already Be An Atheist and Other Magical Tales." The next year, he was chosen to be a contestant in the reality competition Celebrity Apprentice.

Q: You could have pursued many different fields, what made this one stick?I got really obsessed and remained obsessed with the truth and how people distort it. Of course, Houdini was obsessed with that. What is interesting about Houdini is that about halfway into his career, he came out with an intellectual idea... From the very beginning all we wanted to do was a show like Bullshit! We started the first time when we first hit Broadway, Letterman, Stern, and a few people started to know who Penn & Teller were, and we were meeting television networks. The first time we had our first meeting we were pitching a show like Bullshit!, [and saying] "let us do a skeptical show that just tells the truth about the bullsh*t all the other TV shows are passing off as real." We got turned down, and finally in 2003, Showtime was like, "Okay, we will give it a try." The live show is our bread and butter, we have been doing it for 30 years and we love it and nothing is more important to us. Bullshit! is the kind of pure intellectual point we are trying to make.Q: How much of this was your agents'/managers' doing?It's always us, agents and managers are always there making the deals and getting the meetings, but once you want to talk about the show, you know, "what kind of show do the guys want to do," we pretty much have to be in the room going, "we want to do a show about bullsh*t."Q: When did you decide to go with the routine that one of you is outgoing and one of you is more introverted?That actually predates Penn & Teller. Teller put himself through college doing magic in frat parties, whatever layer of hell that is.  He found that if he shut up and did really intense things, people would get sick of heckling him. When we first worked together we were two different acts on the same bill... we were keeping the integrity of the two individual shows, so we had to have Teller be quiet, and over the years we discovered there were all sorts of things that led to that decision that were made unilaterally. Teller was working that way before we met.Q: Tell us a little about your show. I think what we are trying to do, is that there really isn't a hardcore "debunking common sense-type show" that is on — we wanted to do that. But with our style, we get to hang out, have a little fun and be funny, and still tell the truth.Q: If you weren't doing what you are doing now, what else would you be doing?I would be in prison.Penn throws political correctness out the window and talks about politics, offending people, and sleeping with Diana Krall...                
Peter Hoare chatted with Iranian stand-up Maz Jobrani about ethnicity, comedy and what he has coming up.
2014 marks the first time B&W audio will be available in a mid-level priced auto and the first time they will be featuring tweeter-on-top technology in a car.

   CBB Exclusive: Penn and Emily Jillette on Moxie CrimeFighter, Zolten, and their unconditional love – Moms & Babies – Celebrity Babies and Kids - Moms & Babies - People.com
Bullshit’s Penn Jillette, the talkative half of Penn & Teller, and his wife, Emily Zolten Jillette, talk to us exclusively, answering our questions on parenthood and their two children — Moxie CrimeFighter, 2, and Zolten Penn, 13 months next week. Penn tells us about the children’s personalities and their names, while Emily shares her favorite baby-related products.
Photos for use exclusively on the Celebrity Baby Blog, Inc. granted exclusively and specifically by Penn and Emily Jillette.
I’m very happy to say "more of the same." The TV stuff comes and goes, but it’s always the live show that matters. We’re booked at the Rio though 2010 — but, I’m hoping to keep working long after I should have retired. I won’t quit at the right time. 
How do you manage so many projects at once and still make time for family life? How do you try to incorporate the kids into the shows? 
Well, we used the kids for one big hit on The View, [click for video] but that was the exception, not the rule. I don’t want them to do much else until they can want to do it, and I don’t know if they’ll want to do it. I like doing lots of different things, but I have my radio studio in my home and a lot of what I do is writing, so I can run downstairs and see the kids all the time. Also, a lot of what I do is thinking, and I can do that with a child or two in my lap. 
Happy  to Zolten, and happy (early)  to Moxie! What’s it like having two under the age of two? Was the one-year age difference easier or more difficult than you imagined? 
Well, I have no idea what it’s like to have kids further apart. I never noticed kids until I had them. They didn’t exist. I wasn’t close to my friends’ kids, I didn’t really even pay attention. I didn’t even notice kids at our show. Now I do, they’re everywhere and I love them all. I guess everything is easier and better than I thought. 
Penn: EZ is in charge of this stuff. We’re very traditional in that way. Maybe even beyond traditional, to reactionary. I do what I’m told in child care and I use the tools I’m given. There sure is cool shit though, the diaper Genie is amazing and some of the designs on the strollers are like NASA, really great. 
Emily: My list includes such clothing brands as Target, Janie and Jack, True Religion, The Children’s Place and Harajuku Lovers. Our stroller is the Sit and Stand LX. I also love my new Baby Hawk mei tai. 
What are the kids’ personalities like? How are they different and how are they similar? What are they into right now? Is Zolten walking? Any other big milestones to report? 
I thought Mox was the happiest child on earth until I met Z. Z is very easy going. Mox is a little more of a weasel, maybe and Z is more straight-forward. It’s great to have people that you’ve decided to love without thinking about it. Z is walking like a freak and he has about 12 words, which is more than Moxie had at that age. Mox can now say anything. We can talk to her and it’s great. Z is very focused. Very. He’s watching everything. 
If they want, sure. Juggling is easy. Fire eating, they’ll have to really convince me that they’ll be responsible.
You wrote an essay for the book ‘Parenting Beyond Belief: On Raising Ethical, Caring Kids Without Religion’ ($12.20 at Amazon) Why did you feel compelled to contribute and why is it important for secular parents to identify themselves as secular publicly? 
Well, they edited my essay in that book in a way that didn’t thrill me, it isn’t really what I wrote. There is still a stigma attached to being Atheist. While we’ve seen the damage that religion causes, some people are still in the closet about not being superstitious. It feels important for me to not deny that I’m pro-science, but I don’t require others to do it.
When you chose the names ‘Moxie CrimeFighter’ and ‘Zolten’ did you and Emily ever anticipate that people would have such a strong reaction? Do you ever take that reaction personally? And what is the official story behind their names? 
People haven’t taken it very strongly. I heard (but didn’t see) that there were a couple blogs saying nasty stuff, but that’s mostly from people who don’t like that we do a TV show that is pro-science, so they’re looking for something. I have never had a drink in my life, I’ve never done any drugs, I have a very happy home life — what is there to attack? 
I think it’s pretty cruel to give a kid a name that others are going to have. I think it’s very important to have a unique name within any group you’re likely to be in. It’s more friendly to go to school being the only "Penn" then to have to be called by your full name, "Mike Jones" or whatever. I always felt sorry for the Mikes and Bobs. There’s just so many, how do you know when they’re talking to you?
 I love the name Moxie, I love that’s it’s a purely American word, and those are rare, and I love that it stands for old fashioned spunk and energy. EZ pushed for her middle name, "CrimeFighter" because EZ doesn’t have a middle name and thinks middle names are stupid. So, it’s just a joke. When she gets pulled over by the police she can show her license and say, ‘We’re on the same side, officer, my middle name is CrimeFighter.’
Z’s name is special enough unless he moves to Hungary, where it’s a very common name. But "Z" seems to be what he’s called and maybe that’ll stick. Zolten is EZ’s maiden name and I like the respect that shows for her family, and I like that his name Zolten Jillette, is the two families together. 
Do you feel that becoming a father after the age of 50 gives you a unique perspective on parenting? If so, why? If not, do you ever wish you’d had children earlier? 
There was no choice. I wouldn’t consider having children until I had the perfect partner. I met her, and started having kids right away. My Mom was 45 when I was born. I have a sister 23 years older than me (same parents, no other siblings), I was a mistake. 
I loved having older parents. There was a patience and understanding that my friends’ parents seemed to lack. I loved my Mom and Dad so much. So very much. They seemed to know what mattered. Of course, they never got to see Mox and Z or even EZ and that breaks my heart every day. But as big as that is, that’s the only downside. 
You’ve been outspoken about the profound impact your parents’ death had on your own life, and have called your relationship with them ‘perfect.’ What aspects of their parenting style, if any, do you try to emulate with Moxie and Zolten? 
That’s funny, I wrote the above without seeing this. Their love was unconditional. They didn’t have any big problems of their own. I know that Moms are supposed to love unconditionally and dads are supposed to love conditionally. Well, my Dad never got that memo. They both loved me completely from before the day I was born. They got to see my success but that didn’t make them love me more, because there was no more. 
I thought I understood how much they loved me, but I didn’t until I felt the love I have for Mox and Z. Hey, all I have for them is complete love and they’ll have that forever. Everything else is up in the air.
Why would anyone name their kid “Moxie Crimefighter”? That poor child will be hating their name someday.
What an amazing interview! He seems like such a fantastic parent, and the last bit of the interview when he spoke of his relationship with this parents and his relationship with his children I got a lump in my throat! How tender!
What a neat family.  I always thought he was so strange, but that must be a lot of what’s for show.  Sounds like he was raised with an incredible set of parents, and is now raising his own children with tremendous love.  Very cool to read.
Isn’t it great to see a family that actually makes being HAPPY their priority?  I love seeing that! Its a nice little lesson for all of us, take life slower and not so serious! 
No matter how trendy and unique the names are that celebrities choose for their babies, there is no need for wacky names just as Crimefighter. I haven’t seen one celebrity baby that is not cute. They are all cute, my fave being Sean Preston. There’s unique and then there’s UNIQUE. Just imagine when they start school.
What an awesome family.  Sounds like Penn and Emily are wonderful, loving parents.  The kids are so cute, and I actually like their unique names!!
what a great interview!  Penn and Emily have a gorgeous family.  I love love love Moxie and Zolten’s names ;)  I gave my own kids unique names and I’m so glad I did.
I really enjoy listening to Penn Jillette – when we had Free FM here (NJ), his show was one of the highlights. He is intelligent, well informed, very interesting, and obviously loves his kids very much.  I’m curious to see if there will be a backlash about him describing his kids as a “freak” or a “weasel”, ala Angelina. Just for the record, I think that people TOTALLY overreacted to her choice (& the interviewers’) choice of words.
I’m a Penn & Teller fan and have been to see their live show twice. My husband’s even more of a fan and has been for years and years (he especially loves the B.S. show). This was a cool interview to read. The last question/answer made me teary. We should all hope for more of such parental care and familial responsibility in the world, as future generations would benefit greatly.
I never knew much about Penn Jillette, so I had no idea how smart, funny and loving he is with his family.  It was great to read his views on parenting, inspiring really.
And the name Moxie, it’s growing on me!  An American word meaning old fashioned spunk and energy, seems to fit her to a T!
Actually, here in Hungary we don’t use the names Zolten(his name, and I haven’t seen Dracula yet), Zoltin(as it’s also written on babynames.com) or Zolton(what the first comment, I love CBB’s one says-misstyping maybe-), there’s only Zoltan(pronounced Zoltán whose nickname is “Zoli”). So Zolten can come here if this special name thing pulls them back only, I’ll babysit with pleasure. LOL
Thanks for the great interview!  I’ve been a fan of Penn & Teller since I saw their touring show at National Theater in DC back in ’87.  I’ve been to see them in Vegas as well.  I loved Teller’s book about his parents.  It seems like both he and Penn had great relationships with their parents, and both had older parents.  As an older parent myself I am glad to hear positive stories.  I know Penn & Teller don’t hang out a lot offstage, but I am curious if Teller acts as an “uncle” at all.
Dont mean to offend anyone! But I really dont like the word “Athiest” I mean couldn’t there have been another name. I mean…it sounds kinda satanish!
I concur with Mr. Penn 100% with regards to having unique names. They are the spice of life, and frankly I too felt sorry for Jennys and Mikes in my generation. Thus, my husband and I chose *unique* names and take NOTHING personally.
Fun interview!  It’s really nice to have a public figure acknowledge that he’s an atheist AND to point out that one can be both moral and atheistic.  I’m always surprised by the shock and horror that I get in response to such an admission.  I can’t figure out if people are so taken aback because “atheist” has some negative connotation that I don’t get or if the thought of not believing in god is really just that terrible to people.  
…Ummm, so anyway, enjoyed the interview.  And I’m even coming around about the kids’ names.  But, as America’s oldest living “Caitlin,” I feel the need to point out that one should never count on a name not getting really trendy.  My mom still twitches with the desire to shout “mine was first!” when she meets twenty-year-old Caitlins.  
From the Greek ‘a’ -meaning without and ‘theos’ -meaning god. How does Atheist sound satanic? 
I hate to be the voice of reason here- but an absense of belief in any and all gods does not equate to satanic beliefs. Worship of Satan would constitute a belief in a deity – which goes against atheism.  
Christianity invented/believe Satan exists as the antithesis of God or as a fallen angel of God, not athiests. 
That was a really nice interview. Both kids are adorable, especially Moxie, and you can tell he really loves them. That said, his and Emily’s outlook on naming their children leaves a great deal to be desired, in my opinion. If Emily thinks middle names are stupid, that’s her opinion. However, just because you think middle names are stupid doesn’t mean you treat naming your child as a joke. Why not just give her no middle name? Personally, I think naming giving your child the middle name “Crimefighter” so she can tell a police officer pulling her over that she’s on his side is stupid, so to teach their own. 
And really, there are countless names out there that are unique, but still tasteful. I personally don’t know of any Edens, Suris, or Kingstons. You can easily give your child an interesting name and still be tasteful about it.
I usually try not to be judgemental but I can’t help but say that I think they have given their children, particularly the older child, yes unique, but absolutely ridiculous names.  But each to their own, it’s just my opinion.  They seem to be a happy family and I wish them all the best. And gosh, Zolten sounds like a very forward child with 12 words already!
I love his kids names!  How cool to have such a unique name when most kids have the same names over and over! I feel sorry for those kids.  I also don’t get what the fuss over what he named his children is.  He NAMED them, HE raises them, not anyone else. It’s their choice. My philosophy on names is If you are raising them, then you can pick the name,  If you aren’t, then zip it.  
For you guys that think being an Aethist or being referred to an as Aethist is wrong, GET OVER IT!  It’s NONE of your business for one, and for two, they really are called Aethist (I am NOT one, but my Father is…does that make him Satanic? No).  
I think Penn is a great guy, and I love that his family and him have a clean life.  You don’t find that in many stars these days. 
preesi you are right about the word mistake but shame on you for saying what said in your first part of your comment – that was iggnorant more Christians live immoral and disgusting lifestyles then Athiests. Shame on you.
 Is there kids name really Moxie Crimestopper? That is cruel :} poor kid I hope kids don’t make fun of him.
HEY HEY HEY! I NEVER SAID BEING AN ATHIEST IS WRONG. DONT GET IT TWISTED! I said that the word just gave me a negative vibe. that is all. I am not trying to judge anyone. I could care less what people believe in, it has nothing to do with me or my life. Got it! Okay.
I got to know these people through CBB posts and Zolten’s birth announcement,but that was just about it until today.
I am particularly touched by how he describes his relatonship with his parents and his children. Something tells me he’s a great father =]
When I first heard of Moxie’s name, I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, she’ll hate her name when she’s older’. But you know what? I don’t feel that way anymore. I really believe that Penn and his wife will help Moxie through whatever tough times she may have in school with regards to her name, if there are any.  They are stable, loving parents and I really believe Moxie will grow up to love her name and she will love that she is unique in that way. And, I have no doubt she’ll also be able to defend herself, at least verbally.
what is wrong with this man and his wife? moxie is a nice name, but her middle name, “crimefighter?” he explained that “its a joke” because his wife thinks middle names are stupid. that is just horrible to play a joke on any child….especially your own. why give your children middle names if you think they’re stupid?
I have so much respect for Penn Jillette, his wife and family.  I truely beleive he should be our President, but he probably would not apply for that job. He probably wouldn’t enjoy it. Penn is so smart, and a great person.  He’s probably such a great person because he had great parents.  Hey, Maybe Mox or Z will be President one day.  (Beautiful names by the way!)
"We weren't trying to have kids. We left it up to fate. I knew there was a possibility, but I was really excited. Even if you are trying, just to see a positive result is shocking!"
