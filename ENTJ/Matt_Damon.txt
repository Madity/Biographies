Matthew Paige "Matt" Damon (/ˈdeɪmən/; born October 8, 1970) is an American actor, voice actor, screenwriter, producer, and philanthropist whose career was launched following the success of the drama film Good Will Hunting (1997) from a screenplay he co-wrote with friend and actor Ben Affleck. The pair won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay for their work. For his performance in the film, Damon received nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Satellite Award, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor.
Damon has since starred in commercially successful films such as Saving Private Ryan (1998), the Ocean's trilogy, and the first three films in the Bourne series, while also gaining critical acclaim for his performances in dramas such as Syriana (2005), The Good Shepherd (2006), and The Departed (2006). He garnered a Golden Globe nomination for portraying the title character in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Francois Pienaar in Invictus (2009). He is one of the top-40 highest-grossing actors of all time. In 2007, Damon received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was named Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine. Damon has been actively involved in charitable work, including the ONE Campaign, H2O Africa Foundation, and Water.org.
Matt Damon was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the son of Kent Telfer Damon, a stockbroker, and Nancy Carlsson-Paige, an early childhood education professor at Lesley University.[4][5] His father is of Scottish and English ancestry, while his mother is of Finnish and Swedish descent.[6] His brother Kyle is an accomplished sculptor and artist.[5][7]
Damon and his family moved to Newton and lived there for two years. After his parents divorced, Damon and his brother moved with their mother back to Cambridge,[5][8] where they lived in a six-family communal house.[9][10]
Damon grew up near actor Ben Affleck, a close friend since childhood and collaborator on several films. He is Affleck's tenth cousin, once removed, through a common New England ancestor).[11][12] Another neighbor of Damon's was historian and author Howard Zinn,[13] whose biographical film You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train and audio version of A People's History of the United States Damon later narrated.[10]
Damon took to role-playing as a child partly because his mother raised him "by the book",[9] which made him feel as though "you couldn't define yourself, because you already had been defined by her".[9] He attended Cambridge Alternative School (now Graham and Parks) and then Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, where he was a disciplined student[14] and schoolmates with Affleck but had a "terrifying" first two years due to his short height at the time.[15] As a lonely adolescent, Damon has described feeling "such pain in wanting to belong somewhere and not belonging".[9] Damon performed as an actor in several high school theater productions;[5] he has credited his drama teacher at Rindge and Latin, Gerry Speca, as an important artistic influence, even though Damon recalls that, "Mr. Speca always seemed to trust Ben [Affleck] with the biggest roles and longest speeches".[14]
Damon attended Harvard University from 1988 to 1992, but did not graduate.[16] He lived in Matthews Hall and then Lowell House,[17] leaving the university 12 credits shy of completion of his Bachelor of Arts in English to feature in Geronimo.[18][19] While at Harvard, he took part in student theater,[19] appearing in plays such as Burn This in Winthrop House and A... My Name is Alice (in one of the three male roles usually performed by women).[20] Damon dropped out of the university to pursue his acting career in Los Angeles because he mistakenly expected Geronimo: An American Legend to become a big success.[21] "By the time I figured out I had made the wrong decision, it was too late. I was living out here with a bunch of actors, and we were all scrambling to make ends meet", Damon has said.[22]
Damon made his acting debut in 1988 at the age of 18, with a single line of dialogue in the romantic comedy Mystic Pizza.[23] As a student at Harvard University, he continued to pursue acting and performed small roles in projects such as the TNT original film Rising Son and the ensemble prep-school drama School Ties.[24] In 1992, he landed a big part in Geronimo: An American Legend with Gene Hackman and Jason Patric.[24] In 1996, he auditioned for a small role in Cutthroat Island, but was turned away.[25] Damon next appeared as an opiate-addicted soldier in 1996's Courage Under Fire. He was required to lose 40 pounds (18 kg) in 100 days (for only two days of filming).[26][27] After following a self-prescribed diet and fitness regimen to lose the weight, Damon was told after filming that he was fortunate his heart did not shrink. He took medication for a year and a half afterwards to correct the stress inflicted on his adrenal gland. Courage Under Fire gained him some critical notice, as The Washington Post labeled his performance "impressive";[28] Damon has stated that it was worthwhile to risk his health in order to properly portray his character and show the industry how committed he was to his work as an actor.[23][27]
During the early 1990s, Damon and Affleck wrote a screenplay about a young math genius, which they then pitched around Hollywood for a long time. Receiving advice from director Rob Reiner, screenwriter William Goldman, and their friend writer/director Kevin Smith, the two made changes to the script.[21] It eventually became Good Will Hunting (1997) and received nine Academy Awards nominations, earning Damon and Affleck Oscars for Best Original Screenplay.[29][30] Damon was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the same film, which also netted an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for co-star Robin Williams.[29] He and Affleck were each paid salaries of $600,000, while the film grossed over $225 million at the worldwide box office.[31][32] The two later parodied their roles from the film in Kevin Smith's 2001 movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
Also in 1997, Damon was the lead in the critically acclaimed drama The Rainmaker, where he was recognized by the Los Angeles Times as "a talented young actor on the brink of stardom."[33] After meeting Damon on the set of Good Will Hunting, director Steven Spielberg cast Damon as the titular character in the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan.[21]

Damon has become known for choosing a wide variety of film roles,[34] from his portrayal of Patricia Highsmith's anti-hero Tom Ripley in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)[23] to a fallen angel who discusses pop culture as intellectual subject matter with Affleck in Dogma (1999); from a conjoined twin in Stuck on You (2003), which got a mixed critical reception,[35] to the low-budget experimental film Gerry (2002), which he co-wrote with Casey Affleck and Gus Van Sant. Damon garnered generally positive critical reaction for his Golden Globe-nominated[36] portrayal of Ripley, with Variety stating, "Damon outstandingly conveys his character's slide from innocent enthusiasm into cold calculation".[37]
Damon's attempts at essaying leading characters in romantic dramas such as 2000's All the Pretty Horses and The Legend of Bagger Vance were commercially and critically unsuccessful.[31] Variety said of his work in All the Pretty Horses: "[Damon] just doesn't quite seem like a young man who's spent his life amidst the dust and dung of a Texas cattle ranch. Nor does he strike any sparks with [Penelope] Cruz."[38] He was similarly deemed "uncomfortable being the center" of Robert Redford's The Legend of Bagger Vance.[39]
From 2001 to 2007, Damon gained wider international recognition as part of two major film franchises. He co-starred as thief Linus Caldwell, alongside George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts, in Steven Soderbergh's 2001 film Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the Rat Pack's 1960 caper film of the same name; the successful crime dramedy spawned two sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007).[23] He played amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne in the hit action thrillers The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).[23] Entertainment Weekly placed Damon as an "action star" on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "When he first signed on as the ass-kicking amnesiac Jason Bourne in 2002, no one would've predicted that Damon would become the decade's best mixer of brawn and brains. Shows what we know."[40] In August 2007, financial magazine Forbes created a list of actors who generated the best box-office performance related to their salaries; the list placed Damon as the most bankable star of the actors reviewed, revealing that Damon had averaged 29 US dollars at the box office for every dollar he earned for his last three films.[41][42]
Damon played a fictionalized version of Wilhelm Grimm in Terry Gilliam's fantasy adventure The Brothers Grimm (2005), which was a critically panned commercial failure;[31] The Washington Post concluded, "Damon, constantly flashing his newscaster's teeth and flaunting a fake, 'Masterpiece Theatre' dialect, comes across like someone who got lost on the way to an audition for a high school production of 'The Pirates of Penzance.'"[43] Later that year, he appeared as an energy analyst in Syriana.[44] In 2006, Damon joined Robert De Niro in The Good Shepherd as a career CIA officer, and played an undercover mobster working for the Massachusetts State Police in Martin Scorsese's The Departed, a remake of the Hong Kong police thriller Infernal Affairs.[23] Assessing his work in the two films, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Damon "does what few stars with his kind of billing do: he disappears".[34] The Departed was a success amongst critics and audiences alike.[31][45]
Damon had an uncredited cameo in Francis Ford Coppola's Youth Without Youth (2007) and another cameo in the 2008 Che Guevara biopic Che. He lent his voice to the English version of the animated film Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, which was released in the United States in August 2009.[46] He also made a guest appearance in 2009 on the sixth season finale of Entourage as himself, where he tries to pressure Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) into donating to his charity OneXOne—a real foundation for which Damon is an ambassador—and gets increasingly irritated when Chase does not seem to comply.[47][48]
Damon next appeared in Steven Soderbergh's dark comedy The Informant! (2009),[49] in which his Golden Globe-nominated work was described by Entertainment Weekly as such: "The star – who has quietly and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor – is in nimble control as he reveals his character's deep crazies."[50] Also in 2009, Damon portrayed South Africa national rugby union team captain François Pienaar in the Clint Eastwood-directed film Invictus, which is based on the 2008 John Carlin book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation and features Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela.[51] Invictus earned Damon an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The New Republic observed, "It is not a demanding role, but the ever-more-actorly Damon brings it off with low-key charm and integrity."[52]
In 2010, he reteamed with director Paul Greengrass, who directed him in the Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum, for the action thriller Green Zone, which flopped commercially[53] and received ambivalent reception from critics.[54] In motion pictures that feature him either as a leading actor or as a supporting co-star, his films have grossed a total of $1.94[55] to $2.42 billion[56] (based on counting his roles as strictly lead or including supporting roles, respectively) at the North American box office, placing him in the top forty grossing actors of all time.
He has appeared as a guest star in an episode of Arthur, titled "The Making of Arthur", as himself.[57] During Season 5 of 30 Rock, he appeared as guest star in the role of Liz Lemon's boyfriend in the episodes "I Do Do", "The Fabian Strategy", "Live Show", and "Double Edged Sword". Damon's 2010 projects included Clint Eastwood's Hereafter and the Coen Brothers' remake of the 1969 John Wayne-starring Western True Grit; the latter movie started filming in March 2010 and was released in December of that year.[58]
In 2011, he starred in The Adjustment Bureau, Contagion, We Bought a Zoo, and voiced a krill in Happy Feet Two. In April 2012, Damon filmed Promised Land, directed by Gus Van Sant, which he co-wrote with John Krasinski.[59][60][61] Damon's next film with frequent collaborator Steven Soderbergh is Behind the Candelabra, a drama about the life of pianist/entertainer Liberace (played by Michael Douglas) with Damon playing Liberace's longtime partner Scott Thorson. The film premiered on HBO on May 26, 2013.[62]
Damon starred alongside Jodie Foster in the science fiction film Elysium, where he played former car-thief-turned-factory-worker Max DeCosta. The movie was written, co-produced and directed by Neill Blomkamp of District 9, and was released on August 9, 2013.[63] He also appeared in the science fiction movie The Zero Theorem by Terry Gilliam in 2013.
On January 18, 2012, Damon and Affleck confirmed interest in an untitled film project related to the Boston crime figure "Whitey" Bulger recently convicted in August 2013.[64] The untitled film project by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon related to "Whitey" Bulger was described in a 2012 GQ article about Affleck.[65][66] The character played by Jack Nicholson in The Departed (2006), in which Damon was a co-star, was also based in part upon the Boston crime figure "Whitey" Bulger.[67]
Along with Affleck and producers Chris Moore and Sean Bailey, Damon founded the production company LivePlanet, through which the four created the documentary series Project Greenlight to find and fund worthwhile film projects from novice filmmakers.[68] The company produced and founded the short-lived mystery-hybrid series Push, Nevada as well as other projects. Project Greenlight was nominated for Emmys for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004, and 2005.[21]
In March 2010, Damon and Affleck teamed up again to sign a first-look production deal with Warner Bros.[69] The new company is called Pearl Street Films.
Damon was the founder of H2O Africa Foundation, the charitable arm of the Running the Sahara expedition,[21][70] which merged with WaterPartners to create Water.org in July 2009.[71] He, along with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, is one of the founders of Not On Our Watch Project, an organization that focuses global attention and resources to stop and prevent mass atrocities such as in Darfur.[72] Damon supports the ONE Campaign, which is aimed at fighting AIDS and poverty in Third World countries. He has appeared in their print and television advertising. Damon is also an ambassador for OneXOne, a non-profit foundation committed to supporting, preserving and improving the lives of children at home in Canada, the United States, and around the world.[73] Damon is also a spokesperson for Feeding America, the largest USA-focused hunger-relief organization, and a member of their Entertainment Council, participating in their Ad Council PSAs.
Damon is a board member of Tonic Mailstopper (formerly GreenDimes), a company that attempts to halt junk mail delivered to American homes each day.[74] Appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show on April 20, 2007, Damon promoted the organization's efforts to prevent the trees used for junk mail letters and envelopes from being chopped down. Damon stated: "For an estimated dime a day they can stop 70 percent of the junk mail that comes to your house. It's very simple, easy to do, great gift to give, I've actually signed up my entire family. It was a gift given to me this past holiday season and I was so impressed that I'm now on the board of the company."[75]
In 2011, the documentary which he narrated, American Teacher, opened in New York prior to national screening.[76]
Comedian Jimmy Kimmel at some point started stating near the end of his ABC television show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, "My apologies to Matt Damon; we ran out of time", a line lampooning instances where shows cannot feature their last guest due to time constraints. On September 12, 2006, after a segment highlighting the running gag and a lengthy introduction by Kimmel, Damon finally appeared on the show, only for Kimmel to apologetically cut his interview and head to credits, leading Damon to curse him extensively before storming off. This encounter was entirely planned by Kimmel and Damon.[77]
Kimmel's girlfriend at the time, comedian Sarah Silverman, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on January 31, 2008, and aired a clip where she is singing a song entitled "I'm Fucking Matt Damon". Damon appeared in the song with Silverman.[78] Kimmel responded by airing his own music video in which he announced, through song, that he is "fucking Ben Affleck". The video aired on February 24, 2008, and featured Affleck along with a host of celebrities, including Don Cheadle, Brad Pitt, Cameron Diaz, Harrison Ford, and Robin Williams.
Later on, Kimmel's sidekick, Guillermo, appeared in a spoof of The Bourne Ultimatum, which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon as he cursed about Kimmel being behind all this.
The next encounter was titled "The Handsome Men's Club" which featured Kimmel, along with other "Handsome Men" including Matthew McConaughey, John Krasinski, Patrick Dempsey, Sting, Gilles Marini, Ted Danson, Rob Lowe, Keith Urban, Tony Romo, Taye Diggs, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and Lenny Kravitz. At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by Damon stating that they had run out of time and then Damon continues with a sinister laugh.[79]
On January 24, 2013, Damon finally got his revenge on Jimmy Kimmel by taking over his entire show. He not only referenced the long-running feud by mentioning that he has been bumped for 1,205 shows, but involved numerous celebrities who were previously involved in the feud, including Robin Williams. The monologue was hijacked in part by Ben Affleck altering cue cards, and the show culminated with an interview with Kimmel's former fiance, Sarah Silverman.
Damon appeared on Hardball with Chris Matthews in December 2006 and, while discussing the ongoing war in Iraq, he stated: "It seems like we have a fighting class in our country that's comprised of people who have to go for financial reasons... I don't think that that is fair. If you're gonna send people to war... then that needs to be shared by everybody, you know, and if the president has daughters who are of age then maybe they should go too."[80]
Damon is a supporter of the Democratic Party, and has made several critical comments on Republican Party figures, and expressed his disillusionment with the policies of President Barack Obama.[81][82] In 2012 Damon, Ben Affleck, and John Krasinski hosted a fundraiser for Democratic Senate nominee Elizabeth Warren.[83]
In January 2012, it was announced that Damon had signed a multi-year deal to be the voice of TD Ameritrade advertisements, replacing Sam Waterston as the discount brokerage's spokesman. Damon donates all fees from the advertisements to charity.[84]
Damon dated his Good Will Hunting co-star Minnie Driver.[85] He later had a two-year relationship with actress Winona Ryder.[23] From 2001 to 2003, he dated Odessa Whitmire, a former personal assistant of Billy Bob Thornton and Ben Affleck.[23]
Damon met Argentine-born bartender Luciana Bozán Barroso (born 1976) in April 2003 while filming Stuck on You in Miami.[86][87] They became engaged in September 2005 and married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau.[88][87] In 2013, they renewed their wedding vows in front of family and friends in St Lucia.[89][90] Damon is stepfather to Bozán Barroso's daughter, Alexia, from her previous marriage. The couple also have three daughters together; Isabella (b. June 2006),[91] Gia Zavala (b. August 2008)[92] and Stella Zavala (b. October 2010).[93] They moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 2013,[94] having previously lived in both Miami and New York.[95]
Damon is a fan of the Boston Red Sox.[96] After the team won the 2007 World Series, he narrated the commemorative DVD release of the event.[97]
He enjoys playing poker and has competed in several World Series of Poker (WSOP) events[98][99] including the 2010 World Series of Poker main event.[100] He dropped $25,000 at the WSOP while researching his role as a professional poker player in Rounders (1998)[101] and after filming the movie Damon was busted out of the 1998 WSOP by poker professional Doyle Brunson.[102]
Damon won multiple awards for Good Will Hunting, a film he co-wrote with Ben Affleck. He was nominated for the Academy Award as "Best Actor in a Leading Role" and won for "Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen".[29][30]
On July 25, 2007, Damon became the 2,343rd person to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[103] He reacted to the award by stating: "A few times in my life I've had these experiences that are just kind of too big to process and this looks like it's going to be one of those times."[104]
Damon has been nominated for four Screen Actors Guild awards and seven MTV Movie Awards for various films. Additionally, he has three Emmy nominations for his work as producer on three seasons of Project Greenlight.[105]
On March 27, 2010, Damon received the 24th Annual American Cinematheque Award, which was presented to him by Ben Affleck at a ceremony comprising roasts from Damon's colleagues and friends in the entertainment industry.[108]

They were under the impression that they were going to meet the head of Touchstone Pictures.
      His uncle, George Brunstad, swam the English Channel at the age of 70. He completed the 21-mile swim in 15 hours and 59 minutes, making him the new world record holder as the oldest person to complete the swim. In the process, he raised $12,000 for a Haitian children's group (29 August 2004).
      Grew up next door to radical historian Howard Zinn. Damon references Zinn's seminal work "A People's History of the United States" as Will in Good Will Hunting (1997).

      After a notable weight gain for Stuck on You (2003), he lost 22 pounds training for The Bourne Supremacy (2004), eventually having six-pack abs.
      Had never made a sequel until he made Ocean's Twelve (2004) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004), both in the same year. In 2007, the third parts of those series, Ocean's Thirteen (2007) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), opened, making the first trilogies he's starred in.

      Met his wife, Luciana Barroso, in Florida, while he was filming Stuck on You (2003) and she was working as a bartender.
      Was once offered the chance at playing Daredevil when it was in production at Miramax in 1999. This version would have starred Damon and been written by Kevin Smith and directed by Robert Rodriguez. However, Marvel Comics wanted too large a budget for the filmmakers' tastes.

      Turned down the part of Bobby Mercer in Four Brothers (2005), as he found the script to be "ultra-violent". The part eventually went to Mark Wahlberg.
      Appears in two of the six summer 2007 "threequels": Ocean's Thirteen (2007) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). He also appeared in the second; movies of the "Bourne" and "Ocean" franchises in the same year (2004).

      Named Hollywood's "best value" by Forbes Magazine, with his films making $29 (US) for each dollar he is paid (2007).
      He gained over 30 pounds to play Mark Whiteacre in The Informant! (2009), which he dieted off as soon as the shoot was complete.
      He and Ben Affleck lived two blocks away from each other in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when they were children.
      Originally cast as Dan White in Milk (2008), but had to back out due to scheduling conflicts with Green Zone (2010).
      Was at some point in talks to star in a remake of Blue Thunder (1983) with John Milius directing.
      Was, along with Jake Gyllenhaal, the studio's first choice for the role of Jake Sully in Avatar (2009), but director James Cameron chose the (back then) more unknown Sam Worthington in the lead role instead.
      When he and best friend Ben Affleck were struggling actors, they both shared a Boston bank account.

      Currently in Cape Town, South Africa filming Invictus (2009) (aka The Human Factor)). [March 2009]
      Attended The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) premiere in Amsterdam, Netherlands on Aug. 23rd. [August 2007]
      New York City, USA: The documentary film which he narrated, American Teacher (2011), premiered here before opening around the country. [September 2011]
      Filming The Informant! (2009) in Decatur, Illinois (Home to ADM). Various locations. [May 2008]
      Currently shooting director Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson in New York City and Boston. [August 2005]
      As of 2014, has appeared in four films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar (not counting his unconfirmed bit part in Field of Dreams (1989)): Good Will Hunting (1997), Saving Private Ryan (1998), The Departed (2006) and True Grit (2010). The Departed (2006) won in the category.
      Stated that his appearance on The Graham Norton Show with Hugh Bonneville and Bill Murray was 'the best time he'd ever had on a chat show'.
      Some people get into this business and they're so afraid to lose anything. They try to protect their position like clinging to a beachhead. These actors end up making really safe choices. I never wanted to go that route. If I go down, I'm going down swinging. I know that's the way Heath Ledger feels and Ben Affleck feels the same way, too. We want to take the big swings.
      I found myself getting more publicly shy when the gala events and big crowds started. Some people embrace it. To me, it's not worth enough to risk my private life being public.
      I'm not being a monk. I live my life in New York. I have a girlfriend [Luciana Barroso]. But it's not cost-effective for paparazzi to follow us. They can get one picture of us walking down the street.
      Now I feel I have an unspoken deal with the paparazzi: "I won't do anything publicly interesting if you agree not to follow me."
      I'd love to be a dad. I hope I'd be great at it. That's every man's fear, yet his most important job.
      [on The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)] We're all signed on in principle, in the sense that we've all agreed that we want to do it, but we're not going to do it unless we have a great script. It's ours to lose at the minute and, if we do make a third one, we want to make it as good as the first two. And if we can't do that, then we're going to have to let it drop.
      [on The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)] If you have any ideas for a script, please, call Universal! We've gone so far from the book. [Robert Ludlum] wrote it as a trilogy and we've really kind of ignored that plot because it's very Cold War. And so, in the updating process, we kind of threw out most of what he had so we're kind of on our own to find a third one. "Bourne Ultimatum" is the third one and I feel like I've given ultimatums in both the first two!
      If anybody wanted to photograph my life, they'd get bored in a day. "Here's Matt at home learning his lines. Here's Matt researching in aisle six of his local library". A few hours of that and they'd go home.
      What I want to do is a character-driven porn movie. It's all going to be about characters, and the porn's gonna grow all out of the character's and it's going to serve as character development.
      It's just better to be yourself than to try to be some version of what you think the other person wants.
      There are people who appear in the magazines and I don't know who they are. I've never seen anything they've done and their careers are over already. They're famous for maybe 10 minutes. Real careers, I think, take a long time to unfold.
      I'd had people say, "You'll enjoy being famous for a week, and you'll never enjoy it again". But I don't think I had that week. I may have been working and missed that moment.
      Bond is part of the system. He's an imperialist and a misogynist, and he laughs at killing people, and he sits there slugging martinis. It'll never be the same thing as this, because Bourne is a guy who is against the establishment, who is paranoid and on the run. I just think fundamentally they're just very different things.
      The Bond character will always be anchored in the 1960s and in the values of the 1960s. It's so anachronistic when you put it in the world we live in today that Mike Myers made a fortune with his own spy franchise [Austin Powers] - it makes for great comedy. Bond is an imperialist and a misogynist who kills people and laughs about it, and drinks martinis and cracks jokes. Bourne is a serial monogamist whose girlfriend is dead and he does nothing but think about her. He doesn't have the support of gadgets, and he feels guilty for what he's done.
      (On being seen as a 'nice' celebrity) I don't hold myself to some higher standard of behavior. You don't have to do a lot to be seen as nice. I guess some of these people must be such rampant pricks that people are amazed when you say hello. I don't know why people like me, and I don't know if I want to know. That might be the kiss of death. I'd rather people not know a lot about me and go see the movies.
      You've given an aging suburban dad the ego-boost of a lifetime. (On being named People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive 2007)
      (On celebrity campaigns against such things as childhood poverty and disease) Look, I would much rather people were listening to politicians about this than actors. But the politicians aren't talking about this, you know.
      (Talking about working with Robert De Niro in The Good Shepherd (2006)): I think I can say I'm a better actor after having worked with Robert De Niro.
      (On his favorite roles) Good Will Hunting (1997) is so close to my heart because my best friend [Ben Affleck] and I invented him, he's from Boston, and it was what we knew. The stakes were pretty high with "Good Will Hunting" and it worked out as best as it can in this business - people saw the movie, it got good reviews, I was happy with the finished product, and they gave us an Oscar. I am also pretty fond of "Tom Ripley" - playing smart and sinister is just so much fun. I wasn't that fond of his choice of swim trunks, though, so a few points away for that. And "John Grady Cole" in All the Pretty Horses (2000) was good, too. The integrity of that character is admirable. Unfortunately, I am the only one who saw that movie, so no one will get that reference.
      You do the actuary tables, there's a one out of three chance, if not more, that McCain doesn't survive his first term, and it'll be President Palin. It's like a really bad Disney movie, 'The Hockey Mom.' Oh, I'm just a hockey mom from Alaska, and she's president. She's facing down Vladimir Putin and using the folksy stuff she learned at the hockey rink. It's absurd.
      (On James Bond) He's repulsive. Bond is an imperialist, misogynist, sociopath who goes around bedding women and swilling martinis and killing people. The movies have a formula, they stick to it, and it makes them a lot of money. They know what they are doing and they're going to keep doing it.
      [on the difference between Jason Bourne and James Bond] He's not like Bond, who goes on individual missions. I mean, you could make Bond movies forever, because you'd start each film at the beginning of a new mission. But Bourne isn't built that way, unfortunately.
      [on 9/11] That day is seared into who I am more than I'd even like. It was weird because I stepped outside my apartment, looked up and saw it happening and then went back in and just watched CNN because I just wanted information. I remember everything about that day.
      Ask anybody on the street which actors starred in the "Ocean's" movies, and they'll tell you it was George [Clooney] and Brad [Pitt]. I'm 'support' in "Ocean's". As I was in Saving Private Ryan (1998) - Tom [Hanks] carried that movie. You could accuse me of piggybacking on other people's brilliance more than anything.
      [on the Oscars] They should give them out 10 years later, like the way they do the Hall of Fame in baseball. They do it in five years, but if you did 10 years later, if this year (2010), we were voting on what was the best picture of 2000, I think it would be much more honest. It's like, when you pick up great old movies and you go, why the hell didn't Brando win the Oscar for this one? Who won that year? Whatever the sizzle was about that year. 50 years later you're looking at a movie and going, this is a historic cinematic performance.
      [on the possibility of a fourth Jason Bourne movie] I don't know, you know. I think it will be a prequel of some kind with another actor and another director before we (himself and director Paul Greengrass) do another one. I think we are probably five years away from another one. We gotta get a script.
      I want to direct someday and I can't really pass up the chance to work with the people I'm getting to work with. I've worked with Paul Greengrass three times now, and Clint Eastwood twice, and Steven Soderbergh five or six times, and the Cohen Brothers this month. As long as that keeps happening, I can't see myself taking time off, unless the work dried up.
      I've come to believe that the best way, if we really wanted to try to give out awards, would be to wait at least ten years.
      I'm becoming far more interested in just functionality and making sure my body is as strong as it can be so I can swing my kids around and not worry about aches and pains.
      [on what kind of political leadership he supports] Somebody who believes that building a strong, solid, educated middle class is ultimately the best thing for America. Someone like FDR. There's a misconception that leaders lead. They don't. They follow. Every great movement has come from the bottom up.
      [on how he would react to a pandemic in real life] I have the benefit of knowing the virologist Ian Lipkin, our technical adviser [on 'Contagion']. He's not the guy to talk to if you don't want to get paranoid. He will freak you out. But I would follow his advice during an outbreak.
      Working with Steven [Soderbergh] is very different from working with anybody else. He takes the hocus-pocus out of making movies, and I like that.
      I'm always cautious about overstepping any boundaries. At the end of the day, it's a director's medium, and if they don't want to hear from me I just step back.
      As disturbed as I am by a lot of the things that Obama has done and is doing, I would not have preferred a Romney presidency, that's for sure. The alternative is even more frightening.
      I think the values that I have are consistent with the values I was raised with. I vote against my own self-interests constantly. I campaign against my own self-interests. If you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you're probably more likely to be the Koch brothers and think that you shouldn't pay taxes on things. I think it's just a question of where you come from.
      [in defense of friend Ben Affleck, being criticized for agreeing to controversial casting].You know, he's not playing King Lear. It's Batman!

Born in the Cambridge area of Boston, Matt Damon’s parents separated when he was two years old and he and his brother moved to nearby Cambridge. A bright youngster, Matt was a ‘straight A’ student with a love of baseball.
Choosing his projects wisely, he managed to steer a distinguished career path without opting for high-earning, quick turnaround movies favoured by some. Displaying his sinister side in ‘The Talented Mr Ripley’, alongside Jude Law in 1999, he won a new legion of fans, proving his talents lay above and beyond his clean-cut, boy-next-door looks.
‘Ocean's Eleven’ in 2001 was another monster hit that allowed Damon the creative freedom to work on ventures such as ‘Project Greenlight’, which provided a creative vehicle for new movie-making talent. The television show behind the project was a great success and earned Damon and Affleck an Emmy nomination. The pair continued to work on a number of productions having formed Pearl Street Productions together with Chris Moore in 1998.
It was with ‘The Bourne Identity’ in 2002 that Damon made a return to the big screen – a role that earned him a massive $10 million. The film was a worldwide smash and spawned the sequels ‘The Bourne Supremacy’ and ‘The Bourne Ultimatum’.
‘Ocean’s Twelve’ marked another landmark in the young actor’s career as did ‘The Brother’s Grimm’ with Heath Ledger about two con-men who convince villagers they’re being persecuted by evil monsters and then get paid as exorcists.
Despite appearing in a number of movies, many of which were successful, Damon appeared to be unlucky as far as awards were concerned. However, this changed as seven years after picking up a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination for his role in ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’ (1999) he was recognised, albeit alongside co-stars. This happened when Martin Scorsese’s crime film ‘The Departed’ (2006) got a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for best cast.
Several movies followed, including ‘Ocean’s Thirteen’ and ‘Youth Without Youth’ in 2007 and ‘Che: Part Two’ in 2008, before Damon flexed his muscles on the critical stage with his next role. Steven Soderbergh’s 2009 biographical comedy thriller ‘The Informant!’ was well received by critics and ended Damon’s award drought. He received several best actor nominations including a Golden Globe, Chicago Film Critics Association Award and a Satellite Award.
Damon followed this success by getting more recognition for his portrayal of former South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar in 2009 hit ‘Invictus’. He got an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination as well as selections for the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild. 2010 saw him star in war film ‘Green Zone’, ‘Hereafter’ and ‘True Grit’. He is due to appear in a number of 2011 films including ‘Contagion’ and ‘The Adjustment Bureau’, while ‘The Bourne Legacy’ will see him play Jason once more in 2012.
On the personal front Damon has dated a number of his co-stars including Winona Ryder and Minnie Driver, whom he famously ditched during an appearance on ‘The Oprah Winfrey Show’. However, the eligible former bachelor married interior designer Luciana Barroso in a secret ceremony in New York in December 2005, after they met during the filming of his movie ‘Stuck on You’.
On 11 June 2006, Matt and Luciana's first child together, Isabella, was born in Miami. The couple’s second child, Gia Zavala, joined the family in August 2008 before the brood was expanded with the birth of daughter Stella Zavala in 2010. Luciana has one other child, Alexia, from a previous marriage.

What a jerk to say things in his video aboutMcCain and Palin. They will last longer then hismovie crap which his movies have been big flops.Go back to where you came from Damon Under a rock.Your friend Ben was rasied by a single MOM, youstupid idiot.
Wow,This is such a crazy time...I just hope that responsible people will take their views appropriately.  Make a legitmate cause, and speak responsibly.  I think Matt is correct...here we have this women we never heard of, can't give a good interview, doesn't have a direct response of her views, and she could possibly be the President of the US.  What the hell are you people thinking?  God forbid, and God Bless Senator McCain..but the reality is that our country is obsessed with unreality.  Stop being spooned fed, and fess up you don't even know what the facts are.  People are choosing candidates through emotion.  Because your a woman because your a man does not give credit to the candidate.  We need to get the hell out of this situation.  There a people's lives at stake here.  READ! READ! READ!...it is like a bad Disney movie...and Elizabeth...Disney does put out bad movies!  like Steam boat Willie...a slander on Black society...get her off that show god, get her off the "View" SHE is a ridiculous rendition just like Palin of what the true American Women work load is. We are not celebrities and we do not even know what it could be like to be a soccer Mom because we are too busy keeping our kids off the street and being shot by gangs and just keeping food on the table.Most of American Women can not identify with Palin..she's been lucky even with a teenage pregnant daughter..that should be the least of our problem...Let me tell you...there is such a bad taste of democracy in this world that you people of celebrity would even identify with.  Not only is this a bad Disney movie, but it is so far to the extreme you wouldn't even be able to understand because you are so removed from the situation.  Breast feeding is a luxuary, even folding your breast like origamy.....I wish that was the only thing I had to deal with.  I would be most gracious if I could even think about having a child...that gift is taken away from me, as a woman..because I can't even afford to have a child...Than you have the nerve to say that a woman who is raped or assaulted should have the same as a woman who has the choice to consider birth control to have an abortion or not...are you  kidding me..?what the hell are you people thinking?Get our heads out of Brittany's butt and start thinking...these people are not the people that are the people who these votes of who are in charge is to consider.  We are not Oprah, we are not Palin, we are not McCain's wife..we are real women, with real issues...We are dying of breast cancer, we are women who can't have children because we can't afford them...we are the poor and inconsidered..we are the ones left behind.  We are not TMZ degenerates that take advantage and walk out of prison to find a crowd of pleasers.  We are real people with real issues, with a real life...we don't have time to be PTA moms, or soccer moms,,,,we only can wish..we are lockey kids, and drug addicted societies, we are oppressed women still, of color and you do not speak out language at all...get real!
what a guy....and a great actor....who we.can meet....y will kike to have a man....like you.....married of corse......CLAUDIA DUMITRESCU...WALLES...DI CAPRIO
WITH LOVE ....LOVE FROM BUCHAREST.....CLAUDIA DUMITRESCU....WALLES.....AND,,,,,WHAT ABOUT A AMERICAN NAME,,,,,,PRICESS....CLAUDIA....DICAPRIO/////DAMON//////

																				Matt Damon's Wife: Actor Says Falling In Love With 'Civilian' Keeps His Home Life Private

Matt Damon recently opened up about his private life, crediting his non-famous wife, former bartender Luciana Barroso with keeping him out of the public eye.
“I got lucky, I fell in love with a civilian. Not an actress and not a famous actress at that. Because then the attention doesn’t double -- it grows exponentially. Because then suddenly everybody wants to be in your bedroom," Damon said in an interview published in Esquire's August 2013 issue. 
"But I don’t really give them anything. If I’m not jumping up and down on a bar, or lighting something on fire, or cheating on my wife, there’s not really any story to tell," he said. "They can try to stake me out, but they’re always going to get the same story -- middle-aged married guy with four kids. So as long as that narrative doesn’t change too much, there’s no appetite for it.”
Damon and Barroso began dating in 2003 and married at New York City Hall in 2005. They are the parents of three daughters, as well as Barroso's daughter from a previous relationship, and renewed their vows in April on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.
