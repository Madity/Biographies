Richard Bruce "Dick" Cheney[1] (born January 30, 1941) is an American politician and businessman who was the 46th Vice President of the United States from 2001 to 2009, under President George W. Bush.
Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Cheney was primarily raised in Sumner, Nebraska, and Casper, Wyoming.[2] He attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science, and began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger, eventually working his way into the White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations, where he later served as the White House Chief of Staff, from 1975 to 1977. In 1978, Cheney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives representing Wyoming's At-large congressional district from 1979 to 1989; he was reelected five times, briefly serving as House Minority Whip in 1989. Cheney was selected to be the Secretary of Defense during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, holding the position for the majority of Bush's term from 1989 to 1993. During his time in the Department of Defense, Cheney oversaw the 1991 Operation Desert Storm, among other actions. Out of office during the Clinton administration, Cheney was chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000.
In July 2000, Cheney was chosen by presumptive Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush as his running mate in the 2000 presidential election. They defeated their Democratic opponents, incumbent Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman. In 2004 Cheney was reelected to his second term as Vice President; defeating Senator John Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards. During Cheney's tenure as Vice President, he played a lead behind the scenes role in Bush Administration's response to the September 11 attacks and coordination of the War on Terror. He was an early proponent of the Iraq War and defender of the Administration's record on terrorism. He became at odds with the views of President Bush for his support of gay marriage in 2004. Cheney was often criticized for the Bush Administration's policies regarding the War on Terror, NSA Wiretapping and "Enhanced interrogation techniques."[3][4][5]
In 2011, Cheney published his memoir In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir, written with daughter Liz Cheney. Cheney is often cited as the most powerful Vice President in American history.[6][7]
Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (née Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney. He is of predominantly English, as well as Welsh, Irish, and French Huguenot, ancestry; Cheney's 8th great-grandfather, William Cheney, immigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 17th century.[8][9][10] Although not a direct descendant, he is collaterally related to Benjamin Pierce Cheney (1815–1895), the early American expressman. Cheney is a very distant cousin of both Harry S. Truman and Barack Obama; the three share a common ancestor in Mareen Duvall, a Huguenot who fled from France to England in the 17th century and later settled in Maryland.[11] His father was a soil conservation agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and his mother was a softball star in the 1930s;[12] Cheney was one of three children.
He attended Calvert Elementary School[13][14] before his family moved to Casper, Wyoming,[15] where he attended Natrona County High School.
He attended Yale University, but by his own account had problems adjusting to the college, and failed out twice.[16] Among the influential teachers from his days in New Haven was Professor H. Bradford Westerfield, whom Cheney repeatedly credited with having helped to shape his approach to foreign policy.[17] He later attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science. He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.[18]
In November 1962, at the age of 21, Cheney was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was arrested for DWI again the following year.[19] Cheney said that the arrests made him "think about where I was and where I was headed. I was headed down a bad road if I continued on that course".[20]
When Cheney became eligible for the draft, during the Vietnam War, he applied for and received five draft deferments. In 1989, The Washington Post writer George C. Wilson interviewed Cheney as the next Secretary of Defense; when asked about his deferments, Cheney reportedly said, "I had other priorities in the '60s than military service".[21] Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub-par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Initially, he was not called up because the Selective Service System was only taking older men. When he became eligible for the draft, he applied for four deferments in sequence. He applied for his fifth exemption on January 19, 1966, when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant. He was granted 3-A status, the "hardship" exemption, which excluded men with children or dependent parents. In January 1967, Cheney turned 26 and was no longer eligible for the draft.[22]

Cheney's political career began in 1969, as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969–70.[19] He held several positions in the years that followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.[23][24]
Cheney was Assistant to the President under Gerald Ford. When Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense, Cheney became White House Chief of Staff, succeeding Rumsfeld.[19] He later was campaign manager for Ford's 1976 presidential campaign.[25]
In 1978, Cheney was elected to represent Wyoming in the U.S. House of Representatives and succeeded retiring Congressman Teno Roncalio, having defeated his Democratic opponent, Bill Bailey. Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989.
In 1987, he was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference. The following year, he was elected House Minority Whip.[26][26] He served for two and a half months before he was appointed Secretary of Defense instead of former U.S. Senator John G. Tower, whose nomination had been rejected by the U.S. Senate in March 1989.[27]
He voted against the creation of the U.S. Department of Education, citing his concern over budget deficits and expansion of the federal government, and claiming that the Department was an encroachment on states' rights.[28] He voted against funding Head Start, but reversed his position in 2000.[29]
Cheney supported Bob Michel’s (R-IL) bid to become Republican Minority Leader.[30] In April 1980, Cheney endorsed Governor Ronald Reagan for President, becoming one of Reagan's earliest supporters.[31]
In 1986, after President Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to impose economic sanctions on South Africa for its policy of apartheid, Cheney was one of 83 Representatives to vote against overriding Reagan's veto.[32] In later years, he articulated his opposition to unilateral sanctions against many different countries, stating "they almost never work"[33] and that in that case they might have ended up hurting the people instead.[34]
In 1986, Cheney, along with 145 Republicans and 31 Democrats, voted against a non-binding Congressional resolution calling on the South African government to release Nelson Mandela from prison, after the Democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required Mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the African National Congress (ANC) and requiring it to oust the communist faction from its leadership; the resolution was defeated. Appearing on CNN, Cheney addressed criticism for this, saying he opposed the resolution because the ANC "at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and had a number of interests that were fundamentally inimical to the United States."[35]
The federal building in Casper, a regional center of the fossil fuel industry, is named the Dick Cheney Federal Building.[36]
Originally declining, U.S. Congressman Barber Conable persuaded Cheney to join the moderate Republican Wednesday Group in order to move up the leadership ranks. He was elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987. Cheney was the Ranking Member of the Select Committee to investigate the Iran-Contra Affair.[19][37][38] He promoted Wyoming's petroleum and coal businesses as well.[39]
President George H. W. Bush nominated Cheney for the office of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S. Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position.[40] The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0[40] and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993. He directed the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. In 1991, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush.[26] Later that year, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[41]
Cheney worked closely with Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the beginning of his tenure. He focused primarily on external matters, and left most of the internal DoD management to Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood.[27]
Cheney's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup at the height of the Cold War.[42] As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics.[27] Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.[43] When the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the House Armed Services Committee's recommendation.[27]
In subsequent years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.[27]
Over his four years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993.[27] Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed the development of a Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.[44]
Cheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.[27]
Cheney's views on NATO reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin.[27] Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.[45]
Cheney persuaded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war planes in the nation. This was an important element of the success of the Gulf War, as well as a lightning-rod for Islamists, such as Osama bin Laden, who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.[46]
Using economic sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favour.[27] In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties.[47] Although the mission was controversial,[48] U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.[49]
In 1991, the Somali Civil War drew the world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide humanitarian assistance, primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched the first of 26,000 U.S. troops to Somalia as part of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), designed to provide security and food relief.[27] Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin and William J. Perry, had to contend with both the Bosnian and Somali issues.
On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent the invading Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation.[50] An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border.[27] The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.

Cheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale U.S. military operation. According to General Colin Powell, Cheney "had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy. He spent hours in the National Military Command Center peppering my staff with questions."[27]
Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested U.S. military assistance. The United Nations took action as well, passing a series of resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the UN Security Council authorized "all means necessary" to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by January 15, 1991.[50] By then, the United States had a force of about 500,000 stationed in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Other nations, including Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Syria, and Egypt, contributed troops, and other allies, most notably Germany and Japan, agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort, named Operation Desert Shield.[27]
On January 12, 1991, Congress authorized Bush to use military force to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions on Kuwait.[50]
The first phase of Operation Desert Storm, which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraqi forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including the cities of Baghdad and Basra. Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war.[27] He flew with Powell to the region (specifically Riyadh) to review and finalize the ground war plans.[50]
After an air offensive of more than five weeks, UN Coalition forces launched the ground war on February 24. Within 100 hours, Iraqi forces had been routed from Kuwait and Schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective—expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait—had been met on February 27.[51] After consultation with Cheney and other members of his national security team, Bush declared a suspension of hostilities.[50]
A total of 147 U.S. military personnel died in combat, and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes.[27][51] Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6.[27] There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces.[27] Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon.[52][53] In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad. Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a "bad idea" and would have led to a "quagmire", explaining that:
Because if we'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it - eastern Iraq - the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families - it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.[54][55]
Cheney regarded the Gulf War as an example of the kind of regional problem the United States was likely to continue to face in the future.[56]
We're always going to have to be involved [in the Middle East]. Maybe it's part of our national character, you know we like to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up, put a ribbon around it. You deploy a force, you win the war and the problem goes away. But it doesn't work that way in the Middle East. It never has, and isn't likely to in my lifetime.
Between 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney was a director of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization.[57]
With the new Democratic administration under President Bill Clinton in January 1993, Cheney left the Department of Defense and joined the American Enterprise Institute. He also served a second term as a Council on Foreign Relations director from 1993 to 1995.[57] From 1995 until 2000, he served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton, a Fortune 500 company.
Cheney's record as CEO was subject to some dispute among Wall Street analysts. A 1998 merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries attracted the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency.[58] Although Cheney is not named as an individual defendant in the suit, Halliburton shareholders are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated its stock price during this period. In June 2011, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case to continue be litigated.[59] Cheney was named in a December 2010 corruption complaint filed by the Nigerian government against Halliburton, which the company settled for $250 million.[60]
During Cheney's term, Halliburton changed its accounting practices regarding revenue realization of disputed costs on major construction projects.[61] Cheney resigned as CEO of Halliburton on July 25, 2000. As vice president, he argued that this step removed any conflict of interest. Cheney's net worth, estimated to be between $19 million and $86 million,[62] is largely derived from his post at Halliburton.[63] His 2006 gross joint income with his wife was nearly $8.82 million.[64]
He was also a member of the board of advisors of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) before becoming vice president.[46]
In early 2000, while serving as the CEO of Halliburton, Cheney headed then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush's vice-presidential search committee. On July 25, after reviewing Cheney's findings, Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket.[19][65] Halliburton reportedly reached agreement on July 20 to allow Cheney to retire, with a package estimated at $20 million.[66]
A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President.
Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential election. While the election was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet.[67] According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[68]
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons. For a period, Cheney stayed at a variety of undisclosed locations, out of public view.[69] Cheney later revealed in his autobiographical memoir "In My Time" that these "undisclosed locations" included his official Vice Presidential residence, his home in Wyoming, and Camp David.[70] He also utilized a heavy security detail, employing a motorcade of 12 to 18 government vehicles for his daily commute from the Vice Presidential residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory to the White House.[71]
On the morning of June 29, 2002, Cheney served as Acting President of the United States under the terms of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, while Bush was undergoing a colonoscopy. Cheney acted as President from 11:09 UTC that day until Bush resumed the powers of the presidency at 13:24 UTC.[72][73]
Following 9/11, Cheney was instrumental in providing a primary justification for a renewed war against Iraq. Cheney helped shape Bush's approach to the "War on Terror", making numerous public statements alleging Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction,[74] and making several personal visits to CIA headquarters, where he questioned mid-level agency analysts on their conclusions.[75] Cheney continued to allege links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, even though President Bush received a classified President's Daily Brief on September 21, 2001 indicating the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that "there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda".[76] Furthermore, in 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded that there was no "collaborative relationship" between Iraq and al Qaeda.[77]
Following the US invasion of Iraq, Cheney remained steadfast in his support of the war, stating that it would be an "enormous success story",[78] and made many visits to the country. He often criticized war critics, calling them "opportunists" who were peddling "cynical and pernicious falsehoods" to gain political advantage while US soldiers died in Iraq. In response, Senator John Kerry asserted, "It is hard to name a government official with less credibility on Iraq [than Cheney]."[79]
In a March 24, 2008 extended interview conducted in Ankara, Turkey with ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz on the fifth anniversary of the original U.S. military assault on Iraq, Cheney responded to a question about public opinion polls showing that Americans had lost confidence in the war by simply replying "So?"[80] video This remark prompted widespread criticism, including from former Oklahoma Republican Congressman Mickey Edwards, a long-time personal friend of Cheney.[81]
Bush and Cheney were re-elected in the 2004 presidential election, running against John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards. During the election, the pregnancy of his daughter Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney in light of the same-sex marriage debate.[82] Cheney has stated that he is in favor of gay marriages but that each individual state should decide whether to permit it.[83]
Cheney's former chief legal counsel, David Addington,[84] became his chief of staff and remained in that office until Cheney's departure from office. John P. Hannah served as Cheney's national security adviser.[85] Until his indictment and resignation[86] in 2005, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Jr. served in both roles.[87]
On the morning of July 21, 2007, Cheney once again served as acting president, from 7:16 am to 9:21 am. Bush transferred the power of the presidency prior to undergoing a medical procedure, requiring sedation, and later resumed his powers and duties that same day.[88]
After his term began in 2001, Cheney was occasionally asked if he was interested in the Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term and he did not run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator John McCain.[89]
Cheney was a prominent member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG),[90] commonly known as the Energy task force, which comprised energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.[91]
Beginning in 2003, Cheney's staff opted not to file required reports with the National Archives and Records Administration office charged with assuring that the executive branch protects classified information, nor did it allow inspection of its record keeping.[92] Cheney refused to release the documents, citing his executive privilege to deny congressional information requests.[93][94] Media outlets such as Time magazine and CBS News questioned whether Cheney had created a "fourth branch of government" that was not subject to any laws.[95] A group of historians and open-government advocates filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, asking the court to declare that Cheney's vice-presidential records are covered by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and cannot be destroyed, taken or withheld from the public without proper review.[96][97][98][99]

On October 18, 2005, The Washington Post reported that the vice president's office was central to the investigation of the Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal, for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, was one of the figures under investigation.[100]
Following an indictment, Libby resigned his positions as Cheney's chief of staff and assistant on national security affairs.
On September 8, 2006, Richard Armitage, former Deputy Secretary of State, publicly announced that he was the source of the revelation of Plame's status. Armitage said he was not a part of a conspiracy to reveal Plame's identity and did not know whether one existed.[101]
In February 2006, The National Journal reported that Libby had stated before a grand jury that his superiors, including Cheney, had authorized him to disclose classified information to the press regarding intelligence on Iraq's weapons.[102]
On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted on four felony counts for obstruction of justice, perjury, and making false statements to federal investigators.[103] In his closing arguments, independent prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said that there was "a cloud over the vice president",[104] an apparent reference to Cheney's interview with FBI agents investigating the case, which was made public in 2009.[105] Cheney lobbied President George W. Bush vigorously and unsuccessfully to grant Libby a full Presidential pardon up to the day of Barack Obama's inauguration, likening Libby to a "soldier on the battlefield".[106][107]

On February 27, 2007, at about 10 am, a suicide bomber killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target. They also claimed that Osama Bin Laden supervised the operation.[108] The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away. He reported hearing the blast, saying "I heard a loud boom...The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate."[109] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban.[110]

Cheney has been characterized as the most powerful and influential Vice President in history.[111][112] Both supporters and critics of Cheney regard him as a shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney[113] in addition to his office in the West Wing,[114] his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building,[115] and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).[113][116]
Cheney has actively promoted an expansion of the powers of the presidency, saying that the Bush administration’s challenges to the laws which Congress passed after Vietnam and Watergate to contain and oversee the executive branch—the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Presidential Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the War Powers Resolution—are, in Cheney's words, "a restoration, if you will, of the power and authority of the president".[117][118]

In June 2007, the Washington Post summarized Cheney’s vice presidency in a Pulitzer Prize-winning[119] four-part series, based in part on interviews with former administration officials. The articles characterized Cheney not as a "shadow" president, but as someone who usually has the last words of counsel to the president on policies, which in many cases would reshape the powers of the presidency. When former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested to Cheney that the office was largely ceremonial, Cheney reportedly replied, "I have a different understanding with the president." The articles described Cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government, indicated by the use of his own security classification and three man-sized safes in his offices.[120]
The articles described Cheney’s influence on decisions pertaining to detention of suspected terrorists and the legal limits that apply to their questioning, especially what constitutes torture.[121] U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Colin Powell's chief of staff when he was both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the same time Cheney was Secretary of Defense, and then later when Powell was Secretary of State, stated in an in-depth interview that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld established an alternative program to interrogate post-9/11 detainees because of their mutual distrust of CIA.[122]
The Washington Post articles, principally written by Barton Gellman, further characterized Cheney as having the strongest influence within the administration in shaping budget and tax policy in a manner that assures "conservative orthodoxy."[123] They also highlighted Cheney’s behind-the-scenes influence on the administration’s environmental policy to ease pollution controls for power plants, facilitate the disposal of nuclear waste, open access to federal timber resources, and avoid federal constraints on greenhouse gas emissions, among other issues. The articles characterized his approach to policy formulation as favoring business over the environment.[124]
In June 2008, Cheney allegedly attempted to block efforts by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to strike a controversial US compromise deal with North Korea over the communist state's nuclear program.[125]
In July 2008, a former Environmental Protection Agency official stated publicly that Cheney's office had pushed significantly for large-scale deletions from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on the health effects of global warming "fearing the presentation by a leading health official might make it harder to avoid regulating greenhouse gases."[126] In October, when the report appeared with six pages cut from the testimony, The White House stated that the changes were made due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the science. However, according to the former senior adviser on climate change to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson, Cheney's office was directly responsible for nearly half of the original testimony being deleted.[126]
In his role as President of the U.S. Senate, Cheney broke with the Bush Administration Department of Justice, and signed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in the case of Heller v. District of Columbia that successfully challenged gun laws in the nation's capitol on Second Amendment grounds.[127]
On February 14, 2010, in an appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his support of waterboarding and enhanced interrogation techniques for captured terrorist suspects, saying, "I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program."[128]
The Washington Post reported in 2008 that Cheney purchased a home in McLean, Virginia (Washington suburbs), which he was to tear down for a replacement structure. He also maintains homes in Wyoming and on Maryland's Eastern Shore.[129]
In July 2012, Cheney used his Wyoming home to host a private fund-raiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, which netted over $4 million in contributions from attendees for Romney's campaign.[130]
Cheney is the subject of a documentary film "The World According to Dick Cheney" premiering March 15, 2013 on the Showtime television channel.[131][132][133] Cheney was also reported to be the subject of an HBO television mini-series based on Barton Gellman's 2008 book Angler[134] and the 2006 documentary The Dark Side, produced by the Public Broadcasting Service.[135]
Cheney maintained a visible public profile after leaving office,[136] being especially critical of Obama administration policies on national security.[137][138][139] In May 2009, Cheney spoke of his support for same-sex marriage, becoming one of the most prominent Republican politicians to do so. Speaking to the National Press Club, Cheney stated, "People ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish. I do believe, historically, the way marriage has been regulated is at a state level. It's always been a state issue, and I think that's the way it ought to be handled today."[140] In 2012, Cheney reportedly encouraged several Maryland state legislators to vote to legalize same-sex marriage in that state.[141]
Although, by custom, a former vice president unofficially receives six months of protection from the United States Secret Service, President Obama reportedly extended the protection period for Cheney.[142]
On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta told the Senate and House intelligence committees that the CIA withheld information about a secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year.[143] The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.[144]
Cheney has publicly criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election. On December 29, 2009, four days after the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized Obama: "[We] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe. [...] Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society."[145] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, "[I]t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer."[146][147]
During a February 14, 2010 appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration's policies for handling suspected terrorists, criticizing the "mindset" of treating "terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts as opposed to acts of war".[128]
In a May 2, 2011, interview with ABC News, Cheney praised the Obama administration for the operation that resulted in the killing of Osama bin Laden.[148]
In August 2011, Cheney published his memoir, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir, written with Liz Cheney. The book outlines Cheney's recollections of 9/11, the War on Terrorism, the 2001 War in Afghanistan, the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war, enhanced interrogation techniques and other events.[149] According to Barton Gellman, the author of Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, Cheney's book differs from publicly available records on details surrounding the NSA surveillance program.[150][151]
Cheney's early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable, reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the September 11 attacks at 68 percent.[152] However, polling numbers for both him and the president gradually declined in their second terms,[152][153] with Cheney reaching his lowest point shortly before leaving office at 13 percent.[153][154] Cheney's Gallup poll figures are mostly consistent with those from other polls:[152][155]
In April 2007, Cheney was awarded an honorary doctorate of public service by Brigham Young University, where he delivered the commencement address.[156] His selection as commencement speaker was controversial. The college board of trustees issued a statement explaining that the invitation should be viewed "as one extended to someone holding the high office of vice president of the United States rather than to a partisan political figure".[157] BYU permitted a protest to occur so long as it did not "make personal attacks against Cheney, attack (the) BYU administration, the church or the First Presidency".[158]
Cheney has often been compared to Darth Vader, a characterization originated by his critics but later adopted humorously by Cheney himself as well as members of his family and staff.[159]
Cheney is a member of the United Methodist Church[160] and was the first Methodist vice president to serve under a Methodist president.[161]
His wife, Lynne Cheney, was chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to 1996. She is now a public speaker, author, and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The couple have two children, Elizabeth and Mary, and seven grandchildren. Elizabeth, his elder daughter, is married to Philip J. Perry, former General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security. Mary Cheney, a former employee of the Colorado Rockies baseball team and Coors Brewing Company, a campaign aide to the Bush re-election campaign, and an open lesbian, currently lives in Great Falls, Virginia, with her wife Heather Poe. Dick Cheney has publicly supported gay marriage since leaving the vice presidency.[162][163]
Cheney's long histories of cardiovascular disease and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office.[164] Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years,[165] Cheney sustained the first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle.[166][167] He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.[166]
On September 24, 2005, Cheney underwent a six-hour endo-vascular procedure to repair popliteal artery aneurysms bilaterally, a catheter treatment technique used in the artery behind each knee.[168] The condition was discovered at a regular physical in July, and was not life-threatening.[169] Cheney was hospitalized for tests after experiencing shortness of breath five months later. In late April 2006, an ultrasound revealed that the clot was smaller.[168]
On March 5, 2007, Cheney was treated for deep-vein thrombosis in his left leg at George Washington University Hospital after experiencing pain in his left calf. Doctors prescribed blood-thinning medication and allowed him to return to work.[170] CBS News reported that during the morning of November 26, 2007, Cheney was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and underwent treatment that afternoon.[168]
On July 12, 2008, Cheney underwent a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old man with a history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia.[171] On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.[172]
On January 19, 2009, Cheney strained his back "while moving boxes into his new house". As a consequence, he was in a wheelchair for two days, including his attendance at the 2009 United States presidential inauguration.[173][174]
On February 22, 2010, Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after experiencing chest pains. A spokesperson later said Cheney had experienced a mild heart attack after doctors had run tests.[167] On June 25, 2010, Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after reporting discomfort.[175]
In early July 2010, Cheney was outfitted with a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) at Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute to compensate for worsening congestive heart failure.[176] The device pumped blood continuously through his body.[177][178] He was released from Inova on August 9, 2010,[179] and had to decide whether to seek a full heart transplant.[180][181] This pump was centrifugal and as a result he remained alive without a pulse for nearly fifteen months.[182]
On March 24, 2012, Cheney underwent a seven-hour heart transplant procedure at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, at the age of 71. He had been on a waiting list for more than 20 months before receiving the heart from an anonymous donor.[183][184] Cheney's principal cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, advised his patient that "it would not be unreasonable for an otherwise healthy 71-year-old man to expect to live another 10 years" with a transplant, saying in a family-authorized interview that he considered Cheney to be otherwise healthy.[185]
In 2014 while being a guest on Sean Hannity show[186] he called Barack Obama a "weak President" amid the Ukrainian unrest.[187]
On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while participating in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas.[188] Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington suffered a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart.[189] Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.
The Secret Service stated that they notified the Sheriff about one hour after the shooting. Kenedy County Sheriff Ramone Salinas III stated that he first heard of the shooting at about 5:30 PM.[190] The next day, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong informed the Corpus Christi Caller-Times of the shooting.[191] Cheney had a televised interview with MSNBC News about the shooting on February 15. Both Cheney and Whittington have called the incident an accident. Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor. Whittington has since told the Washington Post that he and Cheney were not close friends but acquaintances. When asked if Cheney had apologized, Whittington declined to answer.[192]
The sheriff’s office released a report on the shooting on February 16, 2006 and witness statements on February 22, indicating that the shooting occurred on a clear sunny day, and Whittington was shot from 30 or 40 yards (40 m) away while searching for a downed bird. Armstrong, the ranch owner, claimed that all in the hunting party were wearing blaze-orange safety gear and none had been drinking.[193] However, Cheney has acknowledged that he had one beer four or five hours prior to the shooting.[194] Although Kenedy County Sheriff's Office documents support the official story by Cheney and his party, re-creations of the incident produced by George Gongora and John Metz of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times indicated that the actual shooting distance was closer than the 30 yards claimed.[195]
The incident hurt Cheney's popularity standing in the polls.[196] According to polls on February 27, 2006, two weeks after the accident, Dick Cheney's approval rating had dropped 5 percentage points to 18%.[197] The incident has been the subject of jokes, satire and public ridicule.[198]

    Vice President Richard B. Cheney has had a distinguished career as a businessman and public servant, serving four Presidents and as an elected official. Throughout his service, Mr. Cheney served with duty, honor, and unwavering leadership, gaining him the respect of the American people during trying military times. 
    Mr. Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, on January 30, 1941 and grew up in Casper, Wyoming. He earned his bachelor's and master's of arts degrees from the University of Wyoming. His career in public service began in 1969 when he joined the Nixon Administration, serving in a number of positions at the Cost of Living Council, at the Office of Economic Opportunity, and within the White House. 
    When Gerald Ford assumed the Presidency in August 1974, Mr. Cheney served on the transition team and later as Deputy Assistant to the President. In November 1975, he was named Assistant to the President and White House Chief of Staff, a position he held throughout the remainder of the Ford Administration.

 During a forty-year career in politics, Vice President Dick Cheney has been involved in some of the most consequential decisions in recent American history. He was one of a few select advisers in the room when President Gerald Ford decided to declare an end to the Vietnam War. Nearly thirty years later, from the presidential bunker below the White House in the moments immediately following the attacks of September 11, 2001, he helped shape the response: America's global war on terror. Yet for all of his influence, the world knows very little about Dick Cheney. The most powerful vice president in U.S. history has also been the most secretive and guarded of all public officials. "Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole?" Cheney asked rhetorically in 2004. "It's a nice way to operate, actually."Now, in Cheney: The Untold Story of America's Most Powerful and Controversial Vice President, New York Times bestselling author and Weekly Standard senior writer Stephen F. Hayes offers readers a groundbreaking view into the world of this most enigmatic man. Having had exclusive access to Cheney himself, Hayes draws upon hundreds of interviews with the vice president, his boyhood friends, political mentors, family members, reticent staffers, and senior Bush administration officials, to deliver a comprehensive portrait of one of the most important political figures in modern times.The wide range of topics Hayes covers includes Cheney's withdrawal from Yale; his early run-ins with the law; the incident that almost got him blackballed from working in the Ford White House; his meteoric rise to congressional leadership; his opposition to removing Saddam Hussein from power after the first Gulf War; the solo, cross-country drive he took after leaving the Pentagon; his selection as Bush's running mate; his commanding performance on 9/11; the aggressive intelligence and interrogation measures he pushed in the aftermath of those attacks; the necessity of the Iraq War; the consequences of mistakes made during and after that war; and intelligence battles with the CIA and their lasting effects. With exhaustive reporting, Hayes shines a light into the shadows of the Bush administration and finds a very different Dick Cheney from the one America thinks it knows.

       Before he became George W. Bush's running mate in the 2000 election, Hayes reports, Dick Cheney called the vice presidency a cruddy job. But during his tenure, Hayes argues, Cheney transformed this traditionally inconsequential office into a focal point of presidential power. While emphasizing Cheney's role as vice president, this biography follows his entire political career, beginning with a 1968 congressional fellowship and including key positions in the Ford and George H.W. Bush administrations, as well as 21 years as a congressman. Drawing on interviews with Cheney and others, as well as TV interviews and other journalistic reports, Hayes covers this material engagingly and efficiently. A reporter for the Weekly Standard and author of a previous book on the connection between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, Hayes approaches Cheney sympathetically, countering more critical accounts in the popular press—for example, he laments the way Ambassador Joseph Wilson's flawed storyline regarding forged evidence that Iraq had attempted to acquire uranium from Niger  hardened into conventional wisdom. The book may not convince detractors, but it sketches a vivid portrait of Cheney as an intelligent, quiet leader committed throughout his career, even as a member of Congress, to strengthening the power and authority of the executive branch.

Stephen F. Hayes's new biography of Vice President Cheney is narrative history at its best. Decidedly not an authorized biography, the book is unsparing in its account of Cheney's development from an "analytical" political scientist, primarily interested in political methods, into the most powerful American conservative since President Reagan. Hayes shows how Cheney's experience in the Nixon and Ford administrations encouraged his development from a "moderate" without ideological moorings into a principled conservative whose skepticism of governmental solutions to human problems is founded upon firsthand knowledge of governmental failures.Hayes is interested in neither gossip nor dirt. If you want that, you'll have to find a different book. Nor is it accurate to say that Hayes offers little new information. I had not known, for example, that Cheney went from being a Yale dropout and electrical-company lineman (with two drunk driving arrests) to White House insider in just a decade. If a man capable of such improbable progress fascinates you; if you do not want your preconceptions confirmed, either for or against the man; if you are curious how the "most powerful and controversial vice president" in American history came to assume that title; if you are convinced that a man ought to be judged by how he explains himself rather than by conspiracy theories; if you want to learn about the Vice President's moral and intellectual development and if you believe that it is possible, even for your political opponents, to act from moral and intellectual principle; then this is the book for you.Hayes is a political journalist, and writes like one. As a consequence, the book is not without its faults.Read more ›
  I was one of those people who hated GWB and Dick Cheney. I thought they both came from the devil and had nothing and did nothing for this country except cause misery and harm. But after the Current President was elected I decided to research these two men myself starting with this book. I don't care what people say but this book is not biased in any way. It gives you a real look at a man people don't know much about nor do they care too, they just want to keep hating and hating him and too me that's quite unfair. Im not even half way through with this book but I find it fascinating and enlightening. Dick Cheney is not Satan nor Darth Vader or whatever it is people want to call him. He started out just like any American, and with alot of hard work and a bit of luck he is what he is today. Sure I disagree with some of the things like the war in Iraq but like I said don't judge a book by it's cover. To those who want to get off their butts and really research this man I recommend you start here at this book and I hope in the end you can look at him in perhaps a different way.
The most important fact this book provides about the vice-president is how effectively he fills a unique role in American history. I am currently reading Harry Truman's memoirs. The contrast between the role Truman filled during his 87 days as vice-president, and the role Dick Cheney has played could not be greater. One reason why Cheney has been so effective is his willingness to subordinate his public image to the desires of the Bush Administration. During the vice-presidential debate, Hayes quotes several observers as saying that Cheney and Lieberman should have been at the top of their respective tickets.(Page 295) On several occasions, the Bush handlers have limited Cheney's contacts with the press to avoid unfavorable comparisons to Bush. This has resulted in the "secrecy" image of Cheney being even more persistent than his own inclinations might have wished. It has also resulted in his poor approval ratings, a new phenomenon for a man whose public image for 25 years was positive and even moderate rather than conservative. His rapid rise in government is chronicled after the false start of his Yale years. I liked this part and it reminded me of a similar situation described in General Tommy Franks' biography. He, too, flunked out of college as a result of too much partying and not enough motivation. Maybe I am more sympathetic from my own experience at that age. Cheney was a varsity athlete and star graduate of Natrona County High School in 1959. After the Yale fiasco, he returned to Wyoming and had a few years where his future wasn't promising. He and his high school sweetheart, Lynne, were married in 1964 and he returned to the University of Wyoming to finish his degree and go on to graduate school.Read more ›
Stephen Hayes writes a biography of Cheney from the view of the right with the most access to the vice president than anyother reporter has ever had. With that being said Cheney is still a very private man who shares little about his life.  Hayes is very thorough and provides an excellent look at how Cheney got to where he was from Yale dropout to rising academic that chooses to go into public service in the Ford administration as a chief of staff working with Donald Rumsfeld.  After going into elected office and serving as Secretary of Defense Cheney retired from public life to become a board member at Halliburton.  What would become one of the most controversial parts of the Bush administration when the government would award no bid contracts to the company.As with any political book bias is a huge concern.  When it comes to Cheney's early years much of what is written matches up with other biographies on Reagan and Ford and really paints a picture of how those offices worked.  His recounting of the 9/11 events also is in line with those reports by George Tennet, Richard Clarke and others.  When it comes to the war in Iraq there is a lot of dancing around and I found this to be the least helpful part of the book since it seemed to contradict what others had written.  Now the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle and I doubt we will ever know if this administration came in with the intent to go to war in Iraq.  One thing this book makes very clear is the Bush cabinet was a product of Dick Cheney. He surrounded Bush with close friends like Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Rice and Powell.As to the charge of Cheney being the puppet master it is hard to get a sense.Read more ›
      Call me no blistering hypocrite for admiring how Cheney/Bush revolutionized the office of the Vice Presidentof the USA.  Is Cheney more interesting than Biden?  Definitely!
      This book really gets to the personality, the strength and brilliance of a way under rated but superior American leader.
      After reading this book, I feel more that DC was in a no win position. Thank God he was there and not Edwards.
      I found it difficult to put this book down.  I felt like I got an insight into how the various branches of government really work (or not).  Mr.
      An exciting account of a man propelled by those who loved him.  This is what integrity is.  This is what it looks like.
      Thrilled to get this book, thrilled Steve Hayes decided to pick Cheney.  He is someone I remember from his very FIRST election, and have followed his career from there on.
      This book is really easy to read and really simplifies the history behind some of the big events over the last 25 years.
      I enjoyed getting to know more about Dick Cheney, his past, what influenced him and how he used his life lessons to relate in the public eye.
      Since I am 74 years old, I remember living when this history occurred. Hayes did a good job of reminding me ofthings I had forgotten and showing how Cheney was involved in...
      The more I read, the more I appreciate him.  Vice President Cheney is an amazing man.  He would make a great President.

Dick CheneyU.S. Vice PresidentBorn: 30 January 1941Birthplace: Lincoln, NebraskaBest known as: Vice president of the United States, 2001-2009Name at birth: Richard Bruce Cheney Dick Cheney was elected vice president of the United States in 2000, as the running mate of George W. Bush, and served in that office from 2001-2009. Dick Cheney grew up in Wyoming, where he also earned his college degrees. A staff member in the administration of Richard Nixon, Cheney then became the White House chief of staff under Gerald Ford. Cheney was elected to the House of Representatives from Wyoming in 1978 and quickly rose in the ranks of the Republican party; he also served as vice chairman of the committee investigating the Iran-Contra scandal during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Under President George Bush the elder, Cheney served as Secretary of Defense and played a major role in the Persian Gulf War. Cheney then worked in the oil industry as a top executive for the Halliburton Company before his return to government in 2000. His ties to Halliburton became a source of controversy in 2003, when the company received a major contract to help rebuild Iraq after the U.S. invasion there. Bush and Cheney were re-elected in 2004, narrowly beating a Democratic ticket of John Kerry and John Edwards. Dick Cheney did not choose to run for president in 2008. He was succeeded in 2009 by Democratic vice president Joe Biden.Extra credit: Dick Cheney's wife, Lynne, served in the  Reagan and Bush (the elder) administrations as chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities... Dick Cheney has suffered five heart attacks, the first at age 37, and his health issues were much publicized during his vice presidency; the surgical repairs to Cheney's heart have included the placement of a stent originally designed by Segway inventor Dean Kamen.  Cheney received a full heart transplant on 23 March 2012... Dick Cheney shot 78-year-old fellow hunter Harry Whittington while on a quail-hunting trip in Texas on 11 February 2006. According to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, "Cheney turned to shoot quail that had just been flushed, accidentally peppering one side of Whittington's body." Whittington was hospitalized but did not seem seriously injured until two days later, when he suffered a minor heart attack reportedly caused by bird shot shifting in his body. He was released from the hospital a few days later.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC. All rights reserved.More on Dick Cheney from Infoplease:

BiographyRichard Cheneyvice president of the United StatesBorn: Jan. 30, 1941Birthplace: Lincoln, Neb. President George W. Bush turned to a seasoned Washington insider to be his second in command. The vice president has served under presidents Nixon, Ford, George H.W. Bush, and now George W. Bush. After earning a BA and MA from the University of Wyoming, Cheney worked in the office of Wisconsin Governor Warren Knowles. Two years later, he won an American Political Science Association congressional fellowship. Cheney went to Washington in 1969 to serve as special assistant to Donald Rumsfeld (President George W. Bush's secretary of defense) in the Office of Economic Opportunity in the Nixon administration. In 1974, Rumsfeld led President Ford's transition team, and he brought his protégé to the executive office. When Rumsfeld was named secretary of defense in 1975, Cheney was appointed Ford's chief of staff.  He returned to Wyoming after Ford lost the presidential election to Jimmy Carter in 1976 and worked briefly in the private sector before running for the state's sole seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He soundly defeated his Democratic rival, Bill Bagley, in the 1978 election, and was reelected five times. He rose through the ranks to become minority whip. Cheney served as President George H.W. Bush's defense secretary and commanded the Pentagon during the Persian Gulf War. From 1995 until 2000, Cheney served as CEO of Halliburton Co., a Texas construction and engineering outfit that services oil companies. He left the company to head the vice presidential selection committee. The group vetted several possibilities, but he himself emerged as Bush's top choice.  Cheney has become as one of the most hands-on vice presidents in history. He has weekly one-to-one lunches with the president, is a key foreign-policy advisor, and has taken charge of the president's energy policy, which calls for exploring wider use of nuclear power and fossil fuels, as well as increasing oil drilling. The vice president has been dogged by heart problems. He had three minor heart attacks before age 50 and had quadruple-bypass surgery in 1988. In his first months in office, he had a minor procedure to repair a stent in one of his arteries. See also Encyclopedia: Richard Cheney.

                Richard Bruce Cheney grew up in Casper, Wyoming, and attended the University of Wyoming.He began serving the Nixon administration in 1969. Under President Gerald Ford, Cheney became Assistant to the President and White House Chief of Staff. In 1978, he was elected to represent Wyoming in Congress, and was re-elected five times. He was Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987 when he was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference. The following year, he was elected House Minority Whip. In 1989, he became United States Secretary of Defence under President George H.W. Bush, and in this capacity played a significant role in the Gulf War of 1991. His role in helping to direct Operation 'Desert Storm' earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Cheney joined the American Enterprise Institute in 1993. Two years later, he became President and CEO of Halliburton Company, an energy services company. In early 2000, while working at Halliburton, Cheney headed George W. Bush's vice-presidential search committee. On 25 July that year, after reviewing Cheney's findings, Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket. Halliburton reportedly allowed Cheney to retire, with a package estimated at $20 million. Cheney ran against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential election. The outcome of this well-documented election hinged on uncertain results in Florida and was contested in the federal courts until the U.S. Supreme Court decided the matter. Since the September 11 attacks on the United States, Cheney has helped shape President Bush's approach to the war on terrorism. Despite contrary claims from the Pentagon, Cheney continued to assert a connection between Al-Qaeda and Iraq prior to the Iraq War in several public speeches, drawing criticism from members of the intelligence community and leading Democrats. Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Cheney remained steadfast in his support of the war, stating that it would be an "enormous success story". Bush and Cheney were re-elected for a second term in 2004. Widely considered to be one of the more hawkish members of the cabinet, supporters of Vice President Cheney point to his reputation for knowledge and character. Opponents and detractors accuse him of being too closely tied to the oil industry. On the morning of 27 February 2007, a suicide bomber killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney. Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, claimed responsibility for the attack and said Cheney was its intended target. The Taliban claim that Osama Bin Laden supervised the operation. Cheney has a long history of cardiovascular disease. His periodic need for urgent health care has raised questions about whether he is medically fit to serve in public office. Formerly a heavy smoker, Cheney suffered the first of four heart attacks in 1978, at the age of 37. He is married to Lynne V. Cheney, an author and college teacher, and has two children, Elizabeth and Mary, and six grandchildren.

=======================================================
(born Jan. 30, 1941, Lincoln, Neb., U.S.) U.S. politician. Cheney grew up in Casper, Wyo., and received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Wyoming. He became a deputy assistant to Pres. Gerald Ford in 1974 and served as his chief of staff from 1975 to 1977. In 1978 Cheney was elected from Wyoming to a Republican seat in the U.S. House of Representatives; he served six terms. As secretary of defense (198993) in the administration of Pres. George Bush, he presided over reductions in the military following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Following Bush's electoral defeat in 1992, Cheney became a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and later chairman and chief executive officer of the Halliburton Company, a supplier of technology and services to the oil and gas industries. He was elected vice president on a ticket with George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.
(b. Lincoln, Nebraska, 30 Jan. 1941) US; member of the US House of Representatives 1979 – 89, Secretary for Defense 1989 – 92; vice-president 2001 –  The son of a government soil conservation agent, Cheney was educated at Yale (where he dropped out), the University of Wyoming, and the University of Wisconsin. His political career began in state government in Wisconsin, where between 1965 and 1969 he served on the staff of Governor Warren Knowles. Cheney served as a special assistant to Donald Rumsfeld at the Office of Equal Opportunity (1969 – 70) and then became a staff assistant in the Nixon White House (1970 – 1) and assistant director at the Cost of Living Council (1971 – 3).Cheney left government briefly for banking in 1973; but he had established a close rapport with Rumsfeld and when Rumsfeld headed the Ford transition team, Cheney returned as his deputy. From 1975 to 1976 Cheney was Chief of Staff at the White House, a post he discharged in a low key manner.Elected to the House as Wyoming's Congressman-at-large in 1978, he served in Congress until 1989. He acquired leadership positions early becoming chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in 1981, chairman of the Republican Conference in June 1987 and Republican whip in December of the same year. He combined interest in intelligence and security with concern for Western issues, serving on the Intelligence Committee and Interior.Cheney's conservative politics combined with integrity and policy competence to make him a very popular party man. Following the failure of George Bush's nomination of John Tower as Secretary of Defense in March 1989, Cheney was immediately nominated for the position. Despite some concerns about a series of heart attacks in 1978, Cheney was confirmed. A strong supporter of strengthened defence prior to the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Cheney had the task of reducing the defence budget in the post-Cold War context, a task which inevitably brought him to conflict with the services. His tenure as Secretary of Defense was also marked by the Gulf War. Although Cheney was more sceptical than Bush about the chances of reform succeeding in Russia, his pragmatic approach to these developments corresponded with the President's outlook, enabling him to exercise influence as one of Bush's inner circle of advisers on defence and foreign policy issues throughout the administration.After Bush's defeat in 1992, Cheney went to the American Enterprise Institute.
Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of a federal soil conservation agent, Cheney grew up in Casper, Wyoming, and attended Yale and the Universities of Wyoming and Wisconsin. Appointed a congressional fellow in 1968, he served as assistant to Donald Rumsfeld in various positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations. In 1975–77, Cheney was President Gerald Ford's chief of staff. Then, in 1979–89, Cheney served in the House of Representatives as a staunch but pragmatic conservative Republican from Wyoming. As minority whip, he actively supported President Ronald Reagan's defense buildup and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.President George Bush appointed Cheney secretary of defense after the Senate rejected John Tower. Cheney had no military service, having obtained deferments during the Vietnam War, but as defense secretary (1989–93), despite his skepticism about reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Cheney followed Bush's instructions to downsize the U.S. military. A Washington insider, he challenged the Pentagon's lobbying, reformed procurement, and curtailed a number of weapons programs. But the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell, on his own authority devised the plan for the post–Cold War U.S. military.Although General Powell kept tightly in his own hands operational planning and control of the U.S. military response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Cheney helped persuade the Saudi government to accept U.S. military forces and to join the Allied Coalition that achieved successful liberation of Kuwait from control of Saddam Hussein.[See also Arms Control and Disarmament; Defense, Department of; Persian Gulf War.]

Cheney, Richard (1941-) U.S. congressman, secretary of defense, and vice president, born in Lincoln, Nebraska. In the House of Representatives (1979-89) and as minority whip, he supported President Ronald Reagan's military buildup and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Despite lack of military service, he was appointed by President George H. Bush as secretary of defense (1989-93) after Congress rejected nominee John Tower. Cheney reformed procurement, curtailed some weapons programs, and followed orders to downsize the U.S. military. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (August 2, 1990), Cheney helped persuade Saudi Arabia to permit basing of U.S. military forces and to join the Allied Coalition in the Persian Gulf War (1991) against Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army. In 2000 he was elected vice president on the Republican ticket with George W. Bush.
Loyal service under four Republican presidents and a decade of leadership in Congress brought Richard B. Cheney (born 1941) to the inner circle in President George Bush's cabinet as secretary of defense. Assuming the post in March 1989, he faced Panamanian and Iraqi crises as well as an altered relationship with a disintegrating Soviet Union.After weeks of contentious testimony, President George Bush suffered the first major defeat of his presidency when former Senator John Tower of Texas, his original choice for secretary of defense, was rejected by the full Senate. A day later, on March 10, 1989, the president nominated Representative Richard Bruce Cheney of Wyoming to the post. In a week the Senate confirmed him unanimously.The 48-year-old legislator came to the office strictly through the political route, but both sides of the Senate aisle agreed that he brought to it an agreeable style, an amiable outlook on life, and a near flawless gift for dealing with people. A dedicated Republican, he left the 101st Congress as its newly-minted minority whip, a position second only to that of minority leader.Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, on January 30, 1941, "Dick" Cheney was raised in Casper, Wyoming, by his parents, Richard H., a Department of Agriculture employee, and Marjorie L. Dickey. After a stellar secondary school career, he floundered at Yale, leaving in his sophomore year to return home, where he worked for the next two years before returning to college. Beginning again at the University of Wyoming in 1963, he quickly won his B.A. in political science in 1965 and one year later was granted the M.A. in the same discipline.The Road to Washington Through WyomingWhile at Wyoming he undertook several internships, one with the state legislature and another in the governor's office. These whetted his appetite for government service and led him to apply for a coveted fellowship which brought him to the Washington office of one of the House's most highly respected members, William A. Steiger of Wisconsin.The assignment drew him to the capital in 1968, a year of turmoil marking the end of eight years of Democratic control of both White House and Congress. While some careers were eclipsing, Cheney's was just beginning to rise. The Nixon administration, hungry for youthful blood, put him to work as special assistant to Donald Rumsfeld, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. Cheney and Rumsfeld worked well together, the latter taking Cheney with him as deputy when he became White House counsel and as assistant director of operations when Rumsfeld became director of the Cost of Living Council. These positions, which Cheney held from May 1969 to March 1973, gave him an enviable education in government from the inside.But Watergate Washington in 1973 was no place for a non-lawyer in his early thirties, particularly one with limited private employment experience. He took the vice presidency of an investment advisory group named Bradley, Woods and Company. Agnew's resignation in 1973 and Nixon's departure the following summer thus passed him harmlessly by and in fact opened new horizons.Joining the Ford AdministrationIn August 1974 the call came to join Donald Rumsfeld on President Gerald Ford's transition staff. Cheney began life in the new administration at a considerably higher level than he had left the old. He was to serve as deputy assistant to the president, seconding yet again his close associate, Rumsfeld.In the heady air of the White House, where absurdity is often called reality, Cheney remained himself: loyal, good-natured, pragmatically conservative, extremely civil, and extraordinarily hard-working. These traits brought him to the post of assistant to the president and chief of staff when Rumsfeld became Ford's choice to head the Department of Defense.Cheney served the president from November 1975 until the end of his administration in January 1977. In the execution of his duties, he cultivated an old-fashioned "passion for anonymity" that would have done justice to many in the eras of Franklin Roosevelt and Eisenhower.As chief of staff he was privy to the issues confronting Ford those days and had a direct role in advisement on political matters as well as responsibilities for scheduling the president and managing the White House staff. Once more, this was an education no graduate school could impart.Return to Wyoming, Then a Return to WashingtonFord's defeat by Jimmy Carter sent Cheney back to Wyoming and private employment. But the lure of Washington was too great, and in 1978 he entered the Republican primary, winning it despite being stricken by a coronary attack in the midst of his campaign. Defeating his Democratic opponent in November, he entered the 96th Congress as his state's solitary member of the House of Representatives.During the next decade of his life, from January 1979 until March 1989, Congressman Cheney consistently defined himself as a compassionate conservative. He made friends easily in both parties, assuming a leadership position early in his career. Re-election came easy to him, and he captured Wyoming's seat five times. Well-liked by his party, he was elected chairman of the Republican House Policy Committee in his second term, an unprecedented feat.Cheney's political career as a congressman was benefitted greatly by the return of the Republicans to the White House in 1981. In domestic matters he joined right-of-center Republicans on issues such as abortion. In defense policy, he enthusiastically endorsed Carter, then Reagan, defense build up, including the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, or Star Wars). And in foreign policy he supported Reagan's stands on Nicaragua and Afghanistan. Nor did he neglect Wyoming, espousing popular positions on environmental issues while supporting reasonable use of the state's mineral and forestry resources. For example, Cheney once refused the requests of other congressmen who only wanted to "borrow" some of Wyoming's share of Colorado River water. They would give it back, they promised, and were even willing to put it in writing, after the water shortage eased. "No way," said Cheney. "Once they get it we'll never get it back. That's how things work."His standing in Congress made him a natural choice for service on the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Deals with Iran. Elected as the ranking Republican, and therefore co-chair, he disagreed strongly with the majority report, defending the Reagan administration on the Iran-Contra episode without whitewashing it.Secretary of DefenseHis ten years of service in the House made him a widely respected national figure. The combination of executive-legislative experience gave him an uncommon perspective and compensated for some of the shortcomings which might have impeded his confirmation as defense secretary. Lack of personal military service and little experience in dealing with the Pentagon were built-in objections to his suitability. But these were not seriously entertained, partly because of the circumstances of the Tower rejection but most probably and principally because of the character and nature of Cheney himself. He was up to the job, even if his resume might not trumpet the fact.He came to the position with a track record of enthusiasm for weapons systems but at a time of severe retrenchment made imperative by the deficit crisis at home and possible by the disintegration of the Soviet Union as a world-class antagonist. He early established control over the massive military-civilian bureaucracy, reprimanding one general and removing another for remarks he deemed beyond their authority. It was clear that civilian control of the military as a principle would not suffer under his tenure.His capacity for crisis management was demonstrated in the invasion of Panama, a foreign policy-military operation that proceeded successfully to the seizure of Panama's free-wheeling chief of state, General Manual Noriega. But Secretary Cheney's most important test came in August 1990 with the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Responding to President Bush's call for American troop involvement in the defense of Saudi Arabia, Secretary Cheney undertook a massive movement of material and personnel to the Persian Gulf, where, in response to United Nations Security Council resolutions, they joined other nations from all quarters in pursuing the restoration of the Kuwait monarchy and the protection of America's interests. On January 16, 1991 these resources were employed in a violent air war against Iraq. This was followed by a ground attack launched February 23 that destroyed the bulk of Iraq's military forces in 100 hours. Cheney's key role, along with Chief of Staff Colin Powell, made both men popular heroes. With the formal surrender of Iraq, Cheney turned to the task of reducing the strength of the U.S. military, closing surplus military bases, and other cost-cutting devices. His solid reputation and stand-out professionalism helped him carry out these largely unpopular measures.During his tenure, President Bush, Secretary of State James Baker, and Cheney shaped their party's national security policy. The Bush team reduced the military budget, shrank the size of U.S. military forces, and engaged in a flurry of negotiations that ultimately produced the START I and START II treaties, the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement, and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Bush and Baker led the way to a doubling of the number of U.N. peacekeeping operations across the globe. They all grappled with the issue of disarmament. Cheney's statement, reflecting the Bush administration's course, attested to no new or emerging policy on arms and security: "Arms for America's friends and arms control for its potential foes."A Voice in GovernmentCheney remained Secretary of Defense until 1994, through the political changing of the guard which resulted in the election of Democrat Bill Clinton as president. After leaving his official duties as Secretary of Defense, Cheney remained a voice in government affairs, and frequently commented on Clinton administration choices. In January 1994, Cheney said that the United States should avoid "getting consumed with the problems in Moscow" and instead concentrate on building strong relationships with all the republics of the former Soviet Union, especially Ukraine. In September 1994, he described the U.S. attempts to withdraw quickly from Haiti as "serious misjudgement" while pointing to the difficulties faced while attempting to leave Somalia. With tight budget times and downsizing at the Pentagon under way under the Clinton administration, Cheney was one of the eight civilian Secretaries of Defense invited to give "advice to the re-elected commander in chief" at a special event in Atlanta. In April 1997, he sent a letter to the Senate to protest the imminent ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.Cheney was regarded as corporate America's choice for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, although he removed his name from consideration almost two years before the election. His name was published as one of 15 possible vice presidential candidates as selected by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole.His wife, Lynne (Vincent) Cheney, whom he married in 1964, was a distinguished author and public figure and chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities. She has a doctorate in English, is a former editor of Washingtonian magazine and taught at several colleges and universities. They have two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary.Further ReadingSome biographical data on Cheney's governmental career can be gleaned from accounts of his White House contemporaries and from those of journalists. Gerald Ford's account, A Time To Heal (1979), and John Osborne's White House Watch: The Ford Years (1977), fit those categories. For Cheney's part in the Iran-Contra investigation, see Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1987, Vol. LXIII. His views on congressional responsibilities over national security, delivered at the end of his first year at the Department of Defense, can be found in "Legislative-Executive Relations in National Security," Vital Speeches (March 15, 1990).

His family moved to Casper, Wyo., when he was 13, and he attended the Univ. of Wyoming (B.A., 1965; M.A., 1966) and the Univ. of Wisconsin. A conservative Republican, he served (1970-73) in various White House posts during the Nixon administration and as President Gerald Ford's deputy assistant (1974-75) and de facto chief of staff (1975-77). Elected to the House of Representatives from Wyoming in 1978 and reelected four times, he became House minority whip in 1988. Cheney remained in Congress until 1989, when President George H. W. Bush appointed him secretary of defense, a post he held until 1993. Cheney played an important role in the strategic planning of the Persian Gulf War (1991). In 1995 he became the CEO of the Dallas-based Halliburton Company.Five years later Cheney was picked by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush to be his vice presidential running mate, and, despite losing the popular vote, they narrowly defeated the Gore-Lieberman ticket in the electoral college. Extremely close to President Bush, Cheney brought an unusual degree of executive branch experience to the vice presidency. These factors and his status as a Republican party elder and unlikely future presidential candidate made him one of the most influential vice presidents in more recent American history, particularly in the areas of national security, the economy and taxes, and the federal budget. Cheney became an advocate of a presidency of reinvigorated, enhanced, and minimally constrained power. Within the administration, he was a prominent advocate of invading Iraq and of the use of "enhanced interrogation" that many regarded as torture.Bush and Cheney were reelected in 2004, this time winning a clear majority of the popular vote. In 2005, however, the indictment of Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby, Jr., on charges of lying to and obstructing an investigation into the leaking (2003) of a CIA officer's name was an embarrassment for the administration. (Richard Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state, revealed in 2006 that he had been responsible for the leak of the CIA officer's name that had led to the investigation; he said the act had been inadvertent.) Libby's trial (2007), which ended in his conviction, revealed information about Cheney's involvement in Libby's actions in 2003 and raised questions about whether Cheney had any involvement in obstructing the investigation. After leaving the vice presidency, Cheney became an outspoken critic of the Obama administration.In 1964 Cheney married Lynne V. Cheney, 1941-, b. Casper, Wyo., as Lynne Ann Vincent. Noted as a conservative advocate of traditional educational standards, she headed the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to 1993 and was co-host (1996-8) of television's Crossfire Sunday. Since 1993 she has been a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank.BibliographySee his In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir (with his daughter, L.

Richard Bruce "Dick" Cheney[1] (born January 30, 1941) is an American politician and businessman who was the 46th Vice President of the United States from 2001 to 2009, under President George W. Bush.
Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Cheney was primarily raised in Sumner, Nebraska, and Casper, Wyoming.[2] He began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger, eventually working his way into the White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations, where he later served as the White House Chief of Staff, from 1975 to 1977. In 1978, Cheney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives representing Wyoming's At-large congressional district from 1979 to 1989; he was reelected five times, briefly serving as House Minority Whip in 1989. Cheney was selected to be the Secretary of Defense during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, holding the position for the majority of Bush's term from 1989 to 1993. During his time in the Department of Defense, Cheney oversaw the 1991 Operation Desert Storm, among other actions. Out of office during the Clinton administration, Cheney was chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000.
In July 2000, Cheney was chosen by presumptive Republican Presidential nominee George W. Bush as his running mate in the 2000 presidential election, where they defeated Democratic opponents, then Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman. In 2004 Cheney was reelected to his second term as Vice President, defeating Senator John Kerry and his running mate Senator John Edwards. During Cheney's tenure as Vice President, he played a lead behind the scenes role in Bush Administration's response to the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks and coordination of the War on Terror. He was an early proponent of the Iraq War and defender of the Administration's record on terrorism. He became at odds with the views of President Bush for his support of gay marriage in 2004. Cheney was often criticized for the Bush Administration's policies regarding the War on Terror, NSA Wiretapping and "Enhanced interrogation techniques."[3][4][5]
In 2011, Cheney published his memoir In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir, written with daughter Liz Cheney. Cheney is often cited as the most powerful Vice President in American history.[6][7]
Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (née Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney. He is of predominantly English, as well as Welsh, Irish, and French Huguenot, ancestry; Cheney's 8th great-grandfather, William Cheney, immigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 17th century.[8][9][10] Although not a direct descendant, he is collaterally related to Benjamin Pierce Cheney (1815–1895), the early American expressman. Cheney is a very distant cousin of both Harry S. Truman and Barack Obama; the three share a common ancestor in Mareen Duvall, a Huguenot who fled from France to England in the 17th century and later settled in Maryland.[11] His father was a soil conservation agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and his mother was a softball star in the 1930s;[12] Cheney was one of three children.
He attended Calvert Elementary School[13][14] before his family moved to Casper, Wyoming,[15] where he attended Natrona County High School.
He attended Yale University, but by his own account had problems adjusting to the college, and flunked out twice.[16] Among the influential teachers from his days in New Haven was Professor H. Bradford Westerfield, whom Cheney repeatedly credited with having helped to shape his approach to foreign policy.[17] He later attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science. He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.[18]
In November 1962, at the age of 21, Cheney was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was arrested for DWI again the following year.[19] Cheney said that the arrests made him "think about where I was and where I was headed. I was headed down a bad road if I continued on that course".[20]
When Cheney became eligible for the draft, during the Vietnam War, he applied for and received five draft deferments.[21][22] In 1989, The Washington Post writer George C. Wilson interviewed Cheney as the next Secretary of Defense; when asked about his deferments, Cheney reportedly said, "I had other priorities in the '60s than military service".[23] Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub-par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Initially, he was not called up because the Selective Service System was only taking older men. When he became eligible for the draft, he applied for four deferments in sequence. He applied for his fifth exemption on January 19, 1966, when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant. He was granted 3-A status, the "hardship" exemption, which excluded men with children or dependent parents. In January 1967, Cheney turned 26 and was no longer eligible for the draft.[24]
White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld (left) and his assistant Cheney (right) meet with President Gerald Ford at the White House, April 1975
Cheney's political career began in 1969, as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969–70.[19] He held several positions in the years that followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.[25][26]
Cheney was Assistant to the President under Gerald Ford. When Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense, Cheney became White House Chief of Staff, succeeding Rumsfeld.[19] He later was campaign manager for Ford's 1976 presidential campaign.[27]
In 1978, Cheney was elected to represent Wyoming in the U.S. House of Representatives and succeed retiring Congressman Teno Roncalio, having defeated his Democratic opponent, Bill Bailey. Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989.
In 1987, he was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference. The following year, he was elected House Minority Whip.[28][28] He served for two and a half months before he was appointed Secretary of Defense instead of former U.S. Senator John G. Tower, whose nomination had been rejected by the U.S. Senate in March 1989.[29]
He voted against the creation of the U.S. Department of Education, citing his concern over budget deficits and expansion of the federal government, and claiming that the Department was an encroachment on states' rights.[30] He voted against funding Head Start, but reversed his position in 2000.[31]
Cheney supported Bob Michel’s (R-IL) bid to become Republican Minority Leader.[32] In April 1980, Cheney endorsed Governor Ronald Reagan for President, becoming one of Reagan's earliest supporters.[33]
In 1986, after President Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to impose economic sanctions on South Africa for its policy of apartheid, Cheney was one of 83 Representatives to vote against overriding Reagan's veto.[34] In later years, he articulated his opposition to unilateral sanctions against many different countries, stating "they almost never work"[35] and that in that case they might have ended up hurting the people instead.[36]
In 1986, Cheney, along with 145 Republicans and 31 Democrats, voted against a non-binding Congressional resolution calling on the South African government to release Nelson Mandela from prison, after the Democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required Mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the African National Congress (ANC) and requiring it to oust the communist faction from its leadership; the resolution was defeated. Appearing on CNN, Cheney addressed criticism for this, saying he opposed the resolution because the ANC "at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and had a number of interests that were fundamentally inimical to the United States."[37]
The federal building in Casper, a regional center of the fossil fuel industry, is named the Dick Cheney Federal Building.[38]
Originally declining, U.S. Congressman Barber Conable persuaded Cheney to join the moderate Republican Wednesday Group in order to move up the leadership ranks. He was elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987. Cheney was the Ranking Member of the Select Committee to investigate the Iran-Contra Affair.[19][39][40] He promoted Wyoming's petroleum and coal businesses as well.[41]
President George H. W. Bush nominated Cheney for the office of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S. Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position.[42] The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0[42] and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993. He directed the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. In 1991 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush.[28]
Cheney worked closely with Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the beginning of his tenure. He focused primarily on external matters, and left most internal Pentagon management to Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald J. Atwood, Jr.[29]
Cheney's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military, following President Ronald Reagan's peacetime defense buildup at the height of the Cold War.[43] As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics.[29] Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.[44] When the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the House Armed Services Committee's recommendation.[29] In subsequent years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.[29]
Over his four years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993.[29] Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed the development of a Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.[45]
Cheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.[29]
Cheney's views on NATO reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin.[29] Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.[46]
Cheney persuaded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war planes in the nation. This was an important element of the success of the Gulf War, as well as a lightning-rod for Islamists, such as Osama bin Laden, who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.[47]
Using economic sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favour.[29] In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties.[48] Although the mission was controversial,[49] U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.[50]
In 1991, the Somali Civil War drew the world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide humanitarian assistance, primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched the first of 26,000 U.S. troops to Somalia as part of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), designed to provide security and food relief.[29] Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin and William J. Perry, had to contend with both the Bosnian and Somali issues.
On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent the invading Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation.[51] An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border.[29] The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.
Cheney meets with Prince Sultan, Minister of Defence and Aviation in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to handle the invasion of Kuwait
Cheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale U.S. military operation. According to General Colin Powell, Cheney "had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy. He spent hours in the National Military Command Center peppering my staff with questions."[29]
Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested U.S. military assistance. The United Nations took action as well, passing a series of resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the UN Security Council authorized "all means necessary" to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by January 15, 1991.[51] By then, the United States had a force of about 500,000 stationed in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Other nations, including Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Syria, and Egypt, contributed troops, and other allies, most notably Germany and Japan, agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort, named Operation Desert Shield.[29]
On January 12, 1991, Congress authorized Bush to use military force to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions on Kuwait.[51]
The first phase of Operation Desert Storm, which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraqi forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including the cities of Baghdad and Basra. Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war.[29] He flew with Powell to the region (specifically Riyadh) to review and finalize the ground war plans.[51]
After an air offensive of more than five weeks, UN Coalition forces launched the ground war on February 24. Within 100 hours, Iraqi forces had been routed from Kuwait and Schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective—expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait—had been met on February 27.[52] After consultation with Cheney and other members of his national security team, Bush declared a suspension of hostilities.[51]
A total of 147 U.S. military personnel died in combat, and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes.[29][52] Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6.[29] There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces.[29] Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon.[53][54] In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad. Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a "bad idea" and would have led to a "quagmire", explaining that:
Because if we'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it - eastern Iraq - the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families - it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.[55][56]
Cheney regarded the Gulf War as an example of the kind of regional problem the United States was likely to continue to face in the future.[57]
We're always going to have to be involved [in the Middle East]. Maybe it's part of our national character, you know we like to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up, put a ribbon around it. You deploy a force, you win the war and the problem goes away. But it doesn't work that way in the Middle East. It never has, and isn't likely to in my lifetime.
Between 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney was a director of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization.[58]
With the new Democratic administration under President Bill Clinton in January 1993, Cheney left the Department of Defense and joined the American Enterprise Institute. He also served a second term as a Council on Foreign Relations director from 1993 to 1995.[58] From 1995 until 2000, he served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton, a Fortune 500 company.
Cheney's record as CEO was subject to some dispute among Wall Street analysts. A 1998 merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries attracted the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency.[59] Although Cheney is not named as an individual defendant in the suit, Halliburton shareholders are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated its stock price during this period. In June of 2011, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case to continue be litigated.[60] Cheney was named in a December 2010 corruption complaint filed by the Nigerian government against Halliburton, which the company settled for $250 million.[61]
During Cheney's tenure, Halliburton changed its accounting practices regarding revenue realization of disputed costs on major construction projects.[62] Cheney resigned as CEO of Halliburton on July 25, 2000. As vice president, he argued that this step removed any conflict of interest. Cheney's net worth, estimated to be between $30 million and $100 million, is largely derived from his post at Halliburton, as well as the Cheneys' gross income of nearly $8.82 million.[63][not in citation given]
He was also a member of the board of advisors of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) before becoming vice president.[47]
In early 2000, while serving as the CEO of Halliburton, Cheney headed then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush's vice-presidential search committee. On July 25, after reviewing Cheney's findings, Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket.[19][64] Halliburton reportedly reached agreement on July 20 to allow Cheney to retire, with a package estimated at $20 million.[65]
A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President.
Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential election. While the election was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet.[66] According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[67]
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons. For a period, Cheney stayed at an undisclosed location, out of public view.[68] He also utilized a heavy security detail, employing a motorcade of 12 to 18 government vehicles for his daily commute from the Vice Presidential residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory to the White House.[69]
On the morning of June 29, 2002, Cheney served as Acting President of the United States under the terms of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, while Bush was undergoing a colonoscopy. Cheney acted as President from 11:09 UTC that day until Bush resumed the powers of the presidency at 13:24 UTC.[70][71]
Following 9/11, Cheney was instrumental in providing a primary justification for a renewed war against Iraq. Cheney helped shape Bush's approach to the "War on Terror", making numerous public statements alleging Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction,[72] and making several personal visits to CIA headquarters, where he questioned mid-level agency analysts on their conclusions.[73] Cheney continued to allege links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, even though President Bush received a classified President's Daily Brief on September 21, 2001 indicating the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that "there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda".[74] Furthermore, in 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded that there was no "collaborative relationship" between Iraq and al Qaeda.[75]
Following the US invasion of Iraq, Cheney remained steadfast in his support of the war, stating that it would be an "enormous success story",[76] and made many visits to the country. He often criticized war critics, calling them "opportunists" who were peddling "cynical and pernicious falsehoods" to gain political advantage while US soldiers died in Iraq. In response, Senator John Kerry asserted, "It is hard to name a government official with less credibility on Iraq [than Cheney]."[77]
In a March 24, 2008 extended interview conducted in Ankara, Turkey with ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz on the fifth anniversary of the original U.S. military assault on Iraq, Cheney responded to a question about public opinion polls showing that Americans had lost confidence in the war by simply replying "So?"[78] This remark prompted widespread criticism, including from former Oklahoma Republican Congressman Mickey Edwards, a long-time personal friend of Cheney.[79]
Bush and Cheney were re-elected in the 2004 presidential election, running against John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards. During the election, the pregnancy of his daughter Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney in light of the same-sex marriage debate.[80] Cheney has stated that he is in favor of gay marriages but that each individual state should decide whether to permit it.[81]
Cheney's former chief legal counsel, David Addington,[82] became his chief of staff and remained in that office until Cheney's departure from office. John P. Hannah served as Cheney's national security adviser.[83] Until his indictment and resignation[84] in 2005, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Jr. served in both roles.[85]
On the morning of July 21, 2007, Cheney once again served as acting president, from 7:16 am to 9:21 am. Bush transferred the power of the presidency prior to undergoing a medical procedure, requiring sedation, and later resumed his powers and duties that same day.[86]
After his term began in 2001, Cheney was occasionally asked if he was interested in the Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term and he did not run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator John McCain.[87]
Cheney was a prominent member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG),[88] commonly known as the Energy task force, which comprised energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.[89]
Beginning in 2003, Cheney's staff opted not to file required reports with the National Archives and Records Administration office charged with assuring that the executive branch protects classified information, nor did it allow inspection of its record keeping.[90] Cheney refused to release the documents, citing his executive privilege to deny congressional information requests.[91][92] Media outlets such as Time magazine and CBS News questioned whether Cheney had created a "fourth branch of government" that was not subject to any laws.[93] A group of historians and open-government advocates filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, asking the court to declare that Cheney's vice-presidential records are covered by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and cannot be destroyed, taken or withheld from the public without proper review.[94][95][96][97]

On October 18, 2005, The Washington Post reported that the vice president's office was central to the investigation of the Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal, for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, was one of the figures under investigation.[98] Following an indictment, Libby resigned his positions as Cheney's chief of staff and assistant on national security affairs.
On September 8, 2006, Richard Armitage, former Deputy Secretary of State, publicly announced that he was the source of the revelation of Plame's status. Armitage said he was not a part of a conspiracy to reveal Plame's identity and did not know whether one existed.[99]
In February 2006, The National Journal reported that Libby had stated before a grand jury that his superiors, including Cheney, had authorized him to disclose classified information to the press regarding intelligence on Iraq's weapons.[100]
On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted on four felony counts for obstruction of justice, perjury, and making false statements to federal investigators.[101] In his closing arguments, independent prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said that there was "a cloud over the vice president",[102] an apparent reference to Cheney's interview with FBI agents investigating the case, which was made public in 2009.[103] Cheney lobbied President George W. Bush vigorously and unsuccessfully to grant Libby a full Presidential pardon up to the day of Barack Obama's inauguration, likening Libby to a "soldier on the battlefield".[104][105]

On February 27, 2007, at about 10 am, a suicide bomber killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target. They also claimed that Osama Bin Laden supervised the operation.[106] The bomb went off outside the front gate, however, while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away. He reported hearing the blast, saying "I heard a loud boom...The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate."[107] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban.[108]

Cheney has been characterized as the most powerful and influential Vice President in history.[109][110] Both supporters and critics of Cheney regard him as a shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney[111] in addition to his office in the West Wing,[112] his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building,[113] and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).[111][114]
Cheney has actively promoted an expansion of the powers of the presidency, saying that the Bush administration’s challenges to the laws which Congress passed after Vietnam and Watergate to contain and oversee the executive branch—the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Presidential Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the War Powers Resolution—are, in Cheney's words, "a restoration, if you will, of the power and authority of the president".[115][116]

In June 2007, the Washington Post summarized Cheney’s vice presidency in a Pulitzer Prize-winning[117] four-part series, based in part on interviews with former administration officials. The articles characterized Cheney not as a "shadow" president, but as someone who usually has the last words of counsel to the president on policies, which in many cases would reshape the powers of the presidency. When former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested to Cheney that the office was largely ceremonial, Cheney reportedly replied, "I have a different understanding with the president." The articles described Cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government, indicated by the use of his own security classification and three man-sized safes in his offices.[118]
The articles described Cheney’s influence on decisions pertaining to detention of suspected terrorists and the legal limits that apply to their questioning, especially what constitutes torture.[119] U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Colin Powell's chief of staff when he was both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the same time Cheney was Secretary of Defense, and then later when Powell was Secretary of State, stated in an in-depth interview that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld established an alternative program to interrogate post-9/11 detainees because of their mutual distrust of CIA.[120]
The Washington Post articles, principally written by Barton Gellman, further characterized Cheney as having the strongest influence within the administration in shaping budget and tax policy in a manner that assures "conservative orthodoxy."[121] They also highlighted Cheney’s behind-the-scenes influence on the administration’s environmental policy to ease pollution controls for power plants, facilitate the disposal of nuclear waste, open access to federal timber resources, and avoid federal constraints on greenhouse gas emissions, among other issues. The articles characterized his approach to policy formulation as favoring business over the environment.[122]
In June 2008, Cheney allegedly attempted to block efforts by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to strike a controversial US compromise deal with North Korea over the communist state's nuclear program.[123]
In July 2008, a former Environmental Protection Agency official stated publicly that Cheney's office had pushed significantly for large-scale deletions from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on the health effects of global warming "fearing the presentation by a leading health official might make it harder to avoid regulating greenhouse gases."[124] In October, when the report appeared with six pages cut from the testimony, The White House stated that the changes were made due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the science. However, according to the former senior adviser on climate change to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson, Cheney's office was directly responsible for nearly half of the original testimony being deleted.[124]
In his role as President of the U.S. Senate, Cheney broke with the Bush Administration Department of Justice, and signed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in the case of Heller v. District of Columbia that successfully challenged gun laws in the nation's capitol on Second Amendment grounds.[125]
On February 14, 2010, in an appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his support of waterboarding and enhanced interrogation techniques for captured terrorist suspects, saying, "I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program."[126] At the time, Cheney still enjoyed strong support from voters in the Republican Party.[127]
The Washington Post reported in 2008 that Cheney purchased a home in McLean, Virginia (Washington suburbs), which he was to tear down for a replacement structure. He also maintains homes in Wyoming and on Maryland's Eastern Shore.[128] In July 2012, Cheney used his Wyoming home to host a private fund-raiser for Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, which netted over $4 million in contributions from attendees for Romney's campaign.[129]
Cheney is the subject of an HBO television mini-series based on Barton Gellman's 2008 book Angler[130] and the 2006 documentary The Dark Side, produced by the Public Broadcasting Service.[131]
Cheney maintained a visible public profile after leaving office,[132] being especially critical of Obama administration policies on national security.[133][134][135] In May 2009, Cheney spoke of his support for same-sex marriage, becoming one of the most prominent Republican politicians to do so. Speaking to the National Press Club, Cheney stated, "People ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish. I do believe, historically, the way marriage has been regulated is at a state level. It's always been a state issue, and I think that's the way it ought to be handled today."[136] In 2012, Cheney reportedly encouraged several Maryland state legislators to vote to legalize same-sex marriage in that state.[137]
Although, by custom, a former vice president unofficially receives six months of protection from the United States Secret Service, President Obama reportedly extended the protection period for Cheney.[138]
On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta told the Senate and House intelligence committees that the CIA withheld information about a secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year.[139] The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.[140]
Cheney has publicly criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election. On December 29, 2009, four days after the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized Obama: "[We] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe. [...] Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society."[141] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, "[I]t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer."[142][143]
During a February 14, 2010 appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration's policies for handling suspected terrorists, criticizing the "mindset" of treating "terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts as opposed to acts of war".[126]
In a May 2, 2011, interview with ABC News, Cheney praised the Obama administration for the operation that resulted in the killing of Osama bin Laden.[144]
In August 2011, Cheney published his memoir, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir, written with Liz Cheney. The book outlines Cheney's recollections of 9/11, the War on Terrorism, the 2001 War in Afghanistan, the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war, enhanced interrogation techniques and other events.[145] According to Barton Gellman, the author of Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, Cheney's book differs from publicly available records on details surrounding the NSA surveillance program.[146][147]
Cheney's early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable, reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the September 11th attacks at 68 percent.[148] However, polling numbers for both him and the president gradually declined in their second terms,[148][149] with Cheney reaching his lowest point shortly before leaving office at 13 percent. [150] [151] Cheney's Gallup poll figures are mostly consistent with those from other polls:[148][152]
In April 2007, Cheney was awarded an honorary doctorate of public service by Brigham Young University, where he delivered the commencement address.[153] His selection as commencement speaker was controversial. The college board of trustees issued a statement explaining that the invitation should be viewed "as one extended to someone holding the high office of vice president of the United States rather than to a partisan political figure".[154] BYU permitted a protest to occur so long as it did not "make personal attacks against Cheney, attack (the) BYU administration, the church or the First Presidency".[155]
Cheney has often been compared to Darth Vader, a characterization originated by his critics but later adopted humorously by Cheney himself as well as members of his family and staff.[156]
Cheney is a member of the United Methodist Church[157] and was "the first Methodist Vice President to serve under a Methodist president."[158]
His wife, Lynne Cheney, was Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to 1996. She is now a public speaker, author, and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The couple have two children, Elizabeth and Mary, and six grandchildren. Elizabeth, his elder daughter, is married to Philip J. Perry, former General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security. Mary Cheney, a former employee of the Colorado Rockies baseball team and Coors Brewing Company, a campaign aide to the Bush re-election campaign, and an open lesbian, currently lives in Great Falls, Virginia, with her longtime partner Heather Poe.[159]
Cheney's long histories of cardiovascular disease and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office.[160] Having smoked up to three or more packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years,[161] Cheney sustained the first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle.[162] [163] He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.[162]
On September 24, 2005, Cheney underwent a six-hour endo-vascular procedure to repair popliteal artery aneurysms bilaterally, a catheter treatment technique used in the artery behind each knee.[164] The condition was discovered at a regular physical in July, and was not life-threatening.[165] Cheney was hospitalized for tests after experiencing shortness of breath five months later. In late April 2006, an ultrasound revealed that the clot was smaller.[164]
On March 5, 2007, Cheney was treated for deep-vein thrombosis in his left leg at George Washington University Hospital after experiencing pain in his left calf. Doctors prescribed blood-thinning medication and allowed him to return to work.[166] CBS News reported that during the morning of November 26, 2007, Cheney was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and underwent treatment that afternoon.[164]
On July 12, 2008, Cheney underwent a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old man with a history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia.[167] On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.[168]
On January 19, 2009, Cheney strained his back "while moving boxes into his new house". As a consequence, he was in a wheelchair for two days, including his attendance at the 2009 United States presidential inauguration.[169][170]
On February 22, 2010, Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after experiencing chest pains. A spokesperson later said Cheney had experienced a mild heart attack after doctors had run tests.[163] On June 25, 2010, Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after reporting discomfort.[171]
In early July 2010, Cheney was outfitted with a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) at Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute to compensate for worsening congestive heart failure.[172] The device pumped blood continuously through his body.[173][174] He was released from Inova on August 9, 2010,[175] and had to decide whether to seek a full heart transplant.[176][177] This pump was centrifugal and as a result he remained alive without a pulse for nearly fifteen months.[178]
On March 24, 2012, Cheney underwent a seven-hour heart transplant procedure at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, at the age of 71. He had been on a waiting list for more than 20 months before receiving the heart from an anonymous donor.[179][180] Cheney's principal cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, advised his patient that "it would not be unreasonable for an otherwise healthy 71-year-old man to expect to live another 10 years" with a transplant, saying in a family-authorized interview that he considered Cheney to be otherwise healthy.[181]
On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while participating in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas.[182] Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital in Corpus Christi. On February 14, 2006, Whittington suffered a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart.[183] Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 200 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.
The Secret Service stated that they notified the Sheriff about one hour after the shooting. Kenedy County Sheriff Ramone Salinas III stated that he first heard of the shooting at about 5:30 PM.[184] The next day, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong informed the Corpus Christi Caller-Times of the shooting.[185] Cheney had a televised interview with MSNBC News about the shooting on February 15. Both Cheney and Whittington have called the incident an accident. Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor. Whittington has since told the Washington Post that he and Cheney were not close friends but acquaintances and has not said if Cheney apologized.[186]
The sheriff’s office released a report on the shooting on February 16, 2006 and witness statements on February 22, indicating that the shooting occurred on clear sunny day, and Whittington was shot from 30 or 40 yards (40 m) away while searching for a downed bird. Armstrong, the ranch owner, claimed that all in the hunting party were wearing blaze-orange safety gear and none had been drinking.[187] However, Cheney has acknowledged that he had one beer four or five hours prior to the shooting.[188] Although Kenedy County Sheriff's Office documents support the official story by Cheney and his party, re-creations of the incident produced by George Gongora and John Metz of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times indicated that the actual shooting distance was closer than the 30 yards claimed.[189]
The incident hurt Cheney's popularity standing in the polls.[190] According to polls on February 27, 2006, two weeks after the accident, Dick Cheney's approval rating had dropped 5 percentage points to 18%.[191] The incident has been the subject of jokes, satire and public ridicule.[192]

Cheney's remarkable life story involves the relentless accumulation of power in every form. Elected for a second term, he continues to be one of the most powerful and well-connected men in the world. The fifth estate will show how he accomplished this, what it involved in terms of costs for others and what history's judgment could be.

Cliff No video!  I really wanted to see this.  Maybe it's not working because I'm in Korea?  tony is from texas wow if what  they say about dick chaney dodging the draft was true then  WOWOWOWOW.   A coward sending innocent soldiers to iraq for profit.I mean how much money do you really need?   Dick is already over 70 years old, you don't f****** need money when you're dead.  Willis Nice doc. The classic case of the largest scale of corruption but is somehow overlooked.I hope history shows that Cheney, Bush(both), and Reagan were some of the most corrupt, evil chaps around. Not only were these clowns evil but their work will be the demise of the USA empire.Good job CBC on the doc CBC(Canadian Broadcast Corporation), oddly enough our conservative government is constantly trying to cut the budget of the CBC.  for truth A good, truthful documentary. It's a complex problem for the true,  Americans to deal with the problems of Bush, Cheney and the like.  These false leaders will wonder if they diserve heaven when they meet God and God asks one question...did you love me and your neighbour?  Russ Williams Sad that those who commented on this film cannot distinguish between propaganda and truth. I'd like to know if any of those of you who commented gave 1/2 of your income to charity ...something Dick Cheney has done for the past 20 years.  Let me pose another question.Why is it that every single source cited in the making of this film is left leaning or liberal in ideology? Here's a link to a credible source that did some "real" research about Dick Cheney: http://article.nationalreview.com/269245/cheneys-supposed-lie/eugene-volokh.Now .. all you truth seekers ... let's hear the outcry over the lies your precious Barak Obama has told and the associations he has maintained in his assent to power. If I don't I have the right to label you as hypocrites ... every one of you.  noneutrons? war profiteering isnt right wing or left wing its just not very nice. What has truth seeking got to with obama? and how does seeking truth make someone a hypocrite? Cheney is just a thoroughly unpleasant human being- a functional psychopath if you will who promotes war and makes a hell of a lot of money out of it- whether that money goes to charity or not is irrelevant.Russ you are an idiot- first class- go and look up "conflict of interest"- if you believe firstly in the myth of the left/right paradigm and identify yourself with the right wing of this myth then you should know that not addressing conflicts of interest are what makes capitalism ultimately doomed for failure- causing market manipulation, monopolies and true democracy impossible because the power is held not by consensus but by individuals- these individuals are essentially dictators, hence peoples distaste of them- Cheney had practically absolute power for a time in the US- no matter his actions or the consequences the fact that he was practically a dictator should turn your stomach.(Bush had trouble stringing a cogent sentence together and just did what Dick told him and smiled).  Druidia @RW - The National Review a "credible" source?  Only if you're one of the far right sheep.  Holly Part 3 didn't work for me.  But it is pretty terrifying to learn about the powers of USA.  Kyle Wow, Russ open a book once in a while. Dick Cheney is one of the true villains in politics in the last 20 years. A liar, and war profiteer should not be defended. What was his approval rating again, wasn't it in the low teens? Listening to him say things like "Our biggest mistake was making the war about WMD's," should make anyone recoil in revulsion. He's a NEO-CON hack. Giving to charity doesn't bring back the thousands that have died as a result of his "politics."  Tracy Here's another one I am not going to be able to stomach. A person, a public political person who cannot even HIDE his repulsiveness and who, frankly, doesn't even need to for his deep and nefarious connectedness shouldn't have ever been let out into the daylight for us to look at.  Travis One thing that I did notice other than the corruption of power is that it only proved that the first gulf war destroyed Iraqs real attempt at creating a nuke.  Good or bad the outcome was successful.  I state that however that I Dicky boy is absolute power hungry troll, who will let nothing stand in his way.  swimman155 Russ you are right on. This is a great site but you'll find that most of the comments lean to the far left and Obama can do no wrong.  Realist Russ and swimman155. Just because people do not agree with the far right wing propaganda and outright lies does not mean they're "left leaning". The sheep that call themselves conservatives are becoming a minority, labeling someone left or liberal is....ignorant. You're so far right everything and everyone is "left" as you see it.This doc is not about Obama. I don't think he's so great, his chief of staff is a banker from AIG. Reagans chief of staff was from Meryill Lynch. What's the difference? You voted Reagan in for a second term after his failed policy already had cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. He got us in a huge deficit and the value of the dollar crashed. At least give Obama some time to really screw up the economy, he's on the right track. He's doing the same things Reagan did by lowering interest and giving/keeping the tax breaks and shelters for the rich. Has anyone figured out that policy does not work? Cheney was also one of the masterminds behind BRAC, the base realignment and closure act. Maybe you conservatives should look that up. You'll find that there were three BRACS that eliminated 750k military personnel before Clinton was ever president. 98% of them to be given their pink slips were not, because of the build up for Desert Shield/Storm. They were given those pink slips during Clintons admin so it's easy to blame him for our shortage of troops in uniform. Then just after the republicans were voted in both houses there was a fourth BRAC and 650k troops got their pink slips. Just remember now when you label someone a lefty or a liberal for seeking and believing the truth, they may be like myself and have a couple of honorable discharges. And unlike Lindsay Graham, I was no sissy military lawyer. I dug foxholes and the like.  InedibleHulk I haven't watched the film yet (just about to), but I feel the need to wonder aloud if it's really necessary to censor Mr. Cheney's first name? I get that it doubles as an "offensive" term for a certain body part (which also cannot be mentioned here by its proper label), but this is silly.@Vlatko, would it be possible to remove the capitalized name from this site's blacklist, while leaving the uncapitalized term on it (if you must censor it at all)?  Pyrrhus Richard III and former Vice President Richard Cheney have much in common. As an aside, theist friends have from time to time have asked me if I could 'prove' there is/are no god(s). Until now I have been unable to do so. Now I can. An Almighty and All Merciful God cannot exit. Proof? -- Richard Cheney lives.  http://turcanuandrew@yahoo.com LiberationFront I wonder how some people can call themselves liberals(not that I'd not understand that in America liberal=left wing) when they ultimately are communists(and I mean the author of the movie not all naive people  around here),here in Romania liberals are right wing.This is comunism propaganda made in western laboratory.Not that I disagree with all the documentary (and this is a difference between you and me) is saying but most of you just eat 20 .... from it for every single truth this documentary is saying.This documentary seems to me very similar to comunist movies made during romania's stalinist period in which any kind of business and businessman is considered to be corrupt and evil,it doesn’t  directly say this but it’s clear how the author thinks.About the 1'st gulf-war fact is that Saddam made a declaration of war before starting ostilities. Fact 2 is that if US goverment would lie about who is the real agresor why it would have provoked the war and not just pushing it till the end by Liberating Iraq from Saddam's tribal rule???That when all western democracies(all major goverments in europe where right wing or in US favour) would have been in support of that action(not like in the 2nd gulf war). Fact 3 I'm pretty curious when was that picture made and it makes me laugh because the image I can’t see clearly if those black points on map are just oil platforms or there are also military efectives.And if there are really kuwatian troops around there what prooves that?maybe there were just for defense(surprise there were at the border not in Iraq) and maybe that kuwaitians were’nt  so stupid and knew before that they will be attacked.And if it is indeed a russian satelite picture how did the person who made this documentary have it???Wherever it is from the CIA or FSB the guy is clearly a traitor because in my opinion he should be at least arrested…  lush the film fails to say that james woosley former head of CIA interviewed in the film was a member of the project for the new american century  the think tanks that all the neo-con assclowns came from to begin with jeeez  sevin D1ck Cheney is the reason we are in 2 wars not osama D1ck Cheney is the most evil man on the planet!  Winston Smith it's fascinating to me that to criticize a figure with beliefs that are Right leaning must mean that you are on the Left. And, equally, if one was to criticize someone on the Left, this then must mean you are on the Right. The average person, it seems, can't even comprehend that the entrenched duality of Right/Left is not an absolute. We can have a society that is far more diverse than two sides perpetually pitted against one another. Moreover, it's our average citizens' sheepish adherance to this manufactured duality that perpetuates the ultimate control that multinational corporations, global financial institutions, and their lackeys in various governments have over our perceptions of modern reality.We, as the citizens of western culture desperately need to come to the realization that the corridors of power are no longer structured to represent our interests, rather those of the above mentioned institutions. My prayer? that the right and the left would unify in our disdain for the elites' manipulation of the masses, ultimaely setting the stage for a mass awakening that would usher in a bloodless coup in the name of freedom. The elite are so few and we are so very many. If we were to unite, all the elite power would simply dissolve.I believe this awakening of consciousness is upon us! Much love to all the righties and the lefties, as we are all in this life together!  Owie 1776 I have known for years that Chaney has been robing america for years and it,s pretty obvious to any one that doesn,t have there head in the sand all they had to do was follow the money. when there was a big stink about halliburton being awarded all these contracts they just created all these little companies doing business in Iraq ; all were subsidiaries  of halliburton . Chaney did as he pleased because , I believe he knew way to much about the corruption and deception of the Bush Thieves . The American way of life is for sale to the highest bidder. FOLLOW THE MONEY!  Who me? yeah you! Russ Williams."Sad that those who commented on this film cannot distinguish between propaganda and truth. I’d like to know if any of those of you who commented gave 1/2 of your income to charity …something **** Cheney has done for the past 20 years. Let me pose another question........"Russ, If I had earned the amount of money that Cheney has in the last 20 years I would give 90% to charity and still live a life of great comfort and happiness (Not to mention no loss of innocent lives).What is truly sad is the fact that you evoke the image of simpletons taken in by sloppy propaganda in failing to make any point.You round it off by attacking Obama. Something completely unrelated. He has his critics, myself among them but somehow I dont feel that you and I could even agree the manner in which the critique should be engaged.  Lord Bob Fates The epitome of evil.  pierre as a canadian there was ample evidence wmd in iraq. we all want to hate one another instead of checking for the truth. there was a report in the washington post/times.  oct/24/04/05? that before the invasion 6-8weeks that they iraq and russia moved these weapons to the bakua valley in syria believe it or not. the americans had a iraqi highup scientist?.they found 5ft thick concrete bunkers empty with gas masks found. there is alot more to what ive said .check it out.this invasion because your country is devided this has turned it over to iran with all that oil.we are to weak no will to use our power. usa is fading quickly these countries laugh at u they can get away with anything.  debbye We [U.S.A.] will spread freedom throughout the world, even if we have to destroy you to do it.am unproud to be an american.  free soul Come you masters of war You that build the big guns You that build the death planes You that build all the bombs You that hide behind walls You that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks. ... You that never done nothin' But build to destroy You play with my world Like it's your little toy ... Let me ask you one question Is your money that good Will it buy you forgiveness Do you think that it could I think you will find When your death takes its toll All the money you made Will never buy back your soul.excerpt from the song "Masters of War" by Bob Dylan  Richard The Constitution says that war profiteers are to be put to death.  There it is.  http://extremesarcasm.org Richard A so-so documentary.  While I am no fan of Cheney or GW, the part of the documentary where it discusses the Russian satellite photos of the border between Iraq and Kuwait is total bullshit.  First off, in 1990 Russia was known as the Soviet Union, and the United States and the Soviet Union were still essentially cold war adversaries.  The Soviet Union would not just be handing over un-doctored photographs taken by spy satellites to the United Sates.  Doing so would reveal great insight into the technological capabilities of soviet spy satellites in orbit.  Also, if there were not actually Iraqi forces on the border waiting to invade Kuwait, then where did the 30,000 iraqi troops who DID INVADE Kuwait come from?  Were they invisible?   It's common knowledge that when Saddam met with a US embassador a few days before Iraq invaded Kuwait we told him that the USA has "No opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts" which in political terms essentially means "go ahead, as long as it does not interrupt our oil supply you can kill each other for as long as you want".  Why would Saddam NOT invade Kuwait?   I do not understand why a film about a person such as Cheney has to lie to it's viewers to try and prove a point.Anyone read the article about Cheney's remark about Egypt's x-president Hosni Mubarak? Cheney thinks "He's been a good man, a good friend and ally to the United States," Cheney said. "We need to remember that."America has a horrible track record of befriending oppressive dictators and arming it's future enemies.  http://www.facebook.com/people/Mark-Wolstenholme/507565512 Mark Wolstenholme Typical american attitude. I feel sorry for you.  http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=514269975 Aries Volpe I think the pics were supposed to show troops along the Saudi border not Kuwait in which the pics are clearly visibleGood point you made about the US silently endorsing Saddams invasion and the Soviets sat pics though ill have too check into this a little :)  Angelica Guerrero I'm pretty sure she/he was being ironic.  remoa1 "The Soviet Union would not just be handing over un-doctored photographs taken by spy satellites to the United Sates."Not true.  I personally knew a college Geology professor who obtained through the Russian embassy aerial photos of a part of the USA that the U.S. gov't had not yet photographed.  He had done this in the 1960s when it was still certainly the USSR.  Craigzz Some or should I say most of you Americans are still in some hypnotised state of denial that your politicians would'nt fake things to achieve ojectives such as persian gulf oil.  I cannot believe you are all so stupid, so I will have to assume you are more than aware of the truth, and you defend it for your country's honour, not that of lying politicians.  However, your own country increasingly control you and your freedoms, so I would'nt be so quick to side with those wishing to dismantle your constitution.  http://www.facebook.com/people/Ali-Khan/1218322144 Ali Khan with the heavy heart, all i can say is, if america is a free country with a rule of law and pricipals of democracy and a consitution which provide the guarantees of it, people like dick cheney (aka big oil dick) and george bush shud be tried for treason and crimes against humanity.  Peter Crofts The cynical manner in which he avoided military service really made my skin crawl...  http://pulse.yahoo.com/_M6F3RJVEWJ24QKMCHFNVK7ADVE Winston Smith All these guys need to be in handcuffs  http://pulse.yahoo.com/_M6F3RJVEWJ24QKMCHFNVK7ADVE Winston Smith one of their 'special plans' was 9-11 itself.

Wish him a slow and agonizing death.  http://profile.yahoo.com/WBZSYFFYGK5NY6TMVQPABM22ZY terry Perhaps the good side to all this is that Cheney is a mortal man and will one day pass away to his just reward. On that day the world will be a little bit cleaner and a better place for love to grow. Others will of course come up to take his place but every year their numbers are fewer. At least that should be our daily prayer.
