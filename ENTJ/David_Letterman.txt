David Michael Letterman (born April 12, 1947) is an American television host and comedian.[3] He hosts the late night television talk show Late Show with David Letterman, broadcast on CBS. Letterman has been a fixture on late night television since the 1982 debut of Late Night with David Letterman on NBC. In 1996, David Letterman was ranked #45 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.[4] In 2013, Letterman surpassed friend and mentor Johnny Carson as the longest-serving late-night talk show host in TV history, at 31 years.[5] On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced he will retire sometime in 2015[6][7] around the conclusion of his current contract which ends in August 2015.[8] CBS announced that Stephen Colbert, comedian, writer and host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report since 2005, will take his place.[9]
Letterman is also a television and film producer. His company Worldwide Pants produces his show as well as its network followup The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Worldwide Pants has also produced several prime-time comedies, the most successful of which was Everybody Loves Raymond, currently in syndication.
Letterman was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. His father, Harry Joseph Letterman (April 15, 1915 – February 13, 1973),[10] was a florist.[11] His mother, Dorothy Letterman (née Hofert, now Dorothy Mengering), a church secretary, has been an occasional figure on the show, usually at holidays and birthdays.[12] His mother is of German descent, and his father had English, Scots-Irish, and German ancestry.[13]
He lived on the north side of Indianapolis (Broad Ripple area), not far from Speedway, Indiana, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and he enjoyed collecting model cars, including racers.[14] In 2000, he told an interviewer for Esquire that, while growing up, he admired his father's ability to tell jokes and be the life of the party. Harry Joseph Letterman survived a heart attack at age 36, when David was a young boy. The fear of losing his father was constantly with Letterman as he grew up.[15] The elder Letterman died of a second heart attack[16] at age 57.
Letterman's association with Ball State University is recognized by a renaming ceremony for their David Letterman Communication and Media Building in 2006
Letterman attended his hometown's Broad Ripple High School at the same time as Marilyn Tucker (future wife of Dan Quayle) and worked as a stock boy at the local Atlas Supermarket.[17] According to the Ball State Daily News, he originally had wanted to attend Indiana University, but his grades were not good enough, so he instead attended Ball State University, in Muncie, Indiana.[18] He is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and he graduated in 1969 from what was then the Department of Radio and Television. A self-described average student, Letterman later endowed a scholarship for what he called "C students" at Ball State.[19]
Though he registered for the draft and passed his physical after graduating from college, he was not drafted for service in Vietnam because of receiving a draft lottery number of 352 (out of 366).[20]
Letterman began his broadcasting career as an announcer and newscaster at the college's student-run radio station—WBST—a 10-watt campus station which now is part of Indiana Public Radio.[21] He was fired for treating classical music with irreverence.[21] He then became involved with the founding of another campus station—WAGO-AM 570 (now WWHI, 91.3).[22]
He credits Paul Dixon, host of the Paul Dixon Show, a Cincinnati-based talk show also shown in Indianapolis while he was growing up, for inspiring his choice of career:[2]
"I was just out of college [in 1969], and I really didn't know what I wanted to do. And then all of a sudden I saw him doing it [on TV]. And I thought: That's really what I want to do!"
Letterman began his career as a radio talk show host on WNTS (AM), and on Indianapolis television station WLWI (now called WTHR) as an anchor, and weatherman. He received some attention for his unpredictable on-air behavior, which included congratulating a tropical storm for being upgraded to a hurricane and predicting hail stones "the size of canned hams."[23] He would also occasionally report the weather and the day's very high and low temps for fictitious cities ("Eight inches of snow in Bingree and surrounding areas") while on another occasion saying that a state border had been erased.[24] ("From space you can see the border between Indiana and Ohio has been erased. I'm not in favor of this.") He also starred in a local kiddie show, made wisecracks as host of a late night TV show called "Freeze-Dried Movies" (he once acted out a scene from "Godzilla" using plastic dinosaurs),[25] and hosted a talk show that aired early on Saturday mornings called "Clover Power,"[26] in which he interviewed 4-H members about their projects.[27]
In 1971, Letterman appeared as a pit road reporter for ABC Sports' tape-delayed coverage of the Indianapolis 500.[28] Letterman was initially introduced as Chris Economaki in his job as a corner reporter. Letterman interviewed Mario Andretti, who had just crashed out of the race.
In 1975, encouraged by his then-wife Michelle and several of his Sigma Chi fraternity brothers, Letterman moved to Los Angeles, California, with hope of becoming a comedy writer.[29] He and Michelle packed their belongings in his pickup truck and headed west.[30] He still owns that truck today.[31] In Los Angeles, he began performing stand-up comedy at The Comedy Store.[32] Jimmie Walker saw him on stage; with an endorsement from George Miller, Letterman joined a group of comedians whom Walker hired to write jokes for his stand-up act, a group that at various times would also include Jay Leno, Paul Mooney, Robert Schimmel, Richard Jeni, Louie Anderson, Elayne Boosler, Byron Allen, Jack Handey, and Steve Oedekerk.[32][33]
By the summer of 1977, Letterman was a writer and regular on the six-week summer series The Starland Vocal Band Show, broadcast on CBS.[34] He hosted a 1977 pilot for a game show entitled The Riddlers[35][36] (that was never picked up), and co-starred in the Barry Levinson-produced comedy special Peeping Times that aired in January 1978. Later that year, Letterman was a cast member on Mary Tyler Moore's variety show, Mary.[37] Letterman made a guest appearance on Mork & Mindy (as a parody of EST leader Werner Erhard)[38] and appearances on game shows such as The $20,000 Pyramid,[39] The Gong Show, Password Plus[40] and Liar's Club, as well as talk shows such as The Mike Douglas Show.[episode needed] He was also screen tested for the lead role in the 1980 film Airplane!, a role that eventually went to Robert Hays.[41]
His dry, sarcastic humor caught the attention of scouts for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and Letterman was soon a regular guest on the show. Letterman became a favorite of Carson's and was a regular guest host for the show beginning in 1978. Letterman credits Carson as the person who influenced his career the most.[1]
On June 23, 1980, Letterman was given his own morning comedy show on NBC, The David Letterman Show. It was originally 90 minutes long, but was shortened to 60 minutes in August 1980.[42] The show was a critical success, winning two Emmy Awards, but was a ratings disappointment and was canceled in October 1980.
NBC kept Letterman under contract to try him in a different time slot. Late Night with David Letterman debuted February 1, 1982; the first guest on the first show was Bill Murray.[43] Murray also guested on January 31, 2012–30 years later, and again on June 29, 2012. The show ran Monday through Thursday at 12:30 a.m. Eastern Time, immediately following The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (a Friday night broadcast was added in June 1987). It was seen as being edgy and unpredictable, and soon developed a cult following (particularly among college students). Letterman's reputation as an acerbic interviewer was borne out in verbal sparring matches with Cher[44] (who even called him an asshole on the show), Shirley MacLaine,[45] Charles Grodin, and Madonna. The show also featured comedy segments and running characters, in a style heavily influenced by the 1950s and 1960s programs of Steve Allen.[46] Although Ernie Kovacs is often cited as an influence on the show,[47] Letterman has denied this.[1]
The show often featured quirky, genre-mocking regular features, including "Stupid Pet Tricks"[48] (which had its origins on Letterman's morning show), Stupid Human Tricks,[49] dropping various objects off the roof of a five-story building,[50] demonstrations of unorthodox clothing (such as suits made of Alka-Seltzer,[51] Velcro[52] and suet), a recurring Top 10 list, the Monkey-Cam[53] (and the Audience Cam), a facetious letter-answering segment,[54] several "Film[s] by My Dog Bob" in which a camera was mounted on Letterman's own dog[55] (often with comic results) and Small Town News,[56] all of which would eventually move with Letterman to CBS.
Other memorable moments included Letterman using a bullhorn to interrupt a live interview on The Today Show, announcing that he was the NBC News president while not wearing any pants;[57] and staging "elevator races", complete with commentary by NBC Sports' Bob Costas. In one infamous appearance, in 1982, Andy Kaufman (who was already wearing a neck brace) appeared; interrupting Al Roker on WNBC-TV's broadcast of Live at Five by walking into their studio (which occupied the same floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza as Letterman's studio) to be slapped and knocked to the ground by professional wrestler Jerry Lawler (though Lawler and Kaufman's friend Bob Zmuda later revealed that the event was staged.)[58] In another memorable exchange, sex expert Dr. Ruth Westheimer included cucumbers in a list of handy sex objects that women could find at home. The following night, guest Ted Koppel asked Letterman "May I insert something here?" and Dave responded "OK, as long as it's not a cucumber."[citation needed]
In 1992, Johnny Carson retired, and many fans believed that Letterman would become host of The Tonight Show. When NBC instead gave the job to Jay Leno, Letterman departed NBC to host his own late-night show on CBS, opposite The Tonight Show at 11:30 p.m., called the Late Show with David Letterman. The new show debuted on August 30, 1993 and was taped at the historic Ed Sullivan Theater, where Ed Sullivan broadcast his eponymous variety series from 1948 to 1971. For Letterman's arrival, CBS spent $8 million in renovations.[59] In addition to that cost, CBS also signed Letterman to a lucrative three-year, $14 million/year contract,[60] doubling his Late Night salary. The total cost for everything (renovations, negotiation right paid to NBC, signing Letterman, announcer Bill Wendell, Shaffer, the writers and the band) was over $140 million.
But while the expectation was that Letterman would retain his unique style and sense of humor with the move, Late Show was not an exact replica of his old NBC program. Recognizing the more formal mood (and wider audience) of his new time slot and studio, Letterman eschewed his trademark blazer with khaki pants and white sneakers wardrobe combination in favor of expensive shoes, tailored suits and light-colored socks. The monologue was lengthened. Paul Shaffer and the "World's Most Dangerous Band" followed Letterman to CBS, but they added a brass section and were rebranded the "CBS Orchestra" as a short monologue and a small band were mandated by Carson while Letterman occupied the 12:30 slot. Additionally, because of intellectual property disagreements, Letterman was unable to import many of his Late Night segments verbatim,[61] but he sidestepped this problem by simply renaming them (the "Top Ten List" became the "Late Show Top Ten", "Viewer Mail" became the "CBS Mailbag", etc.)
The Simpsons and Saturday Night Live writer Conan O'Brien went from an entertainment unknown to hosting Letterman's old show on NBC
The main competitor of The Late Show is NBC's The Tonight Show, which was hosted by Jay Leno for nearly 16 years, but from June 1, 2009, to January 22, 2010, was hosted by Conan O'Brien. In 1993 and 1994, The Late Show consistently gained higher ratings than The Tonight Show. But in 1995, ratings dipped and Leno's show consistently beat Letterman's in the ratings from the time that Hugh Grant came on Leno's show after Grant's arrest for soliciting a prostitute;[62] Leno typically attracted about 5 million nightly viewers between 1999 and 2009. The Late Show lost nearly half its audience during its competition with Leno, attracting 7.1 million viewers nightly in its 1993–94 season and about 3.8 million per night as of Leno's departure in 2009.[63] In the final months of his first stint as host of The Tonight Show, Leno beat Letterman in the ratings by a 1.3 million viewer margin (5.2 million to 3.9 million), and Nightline and The Late Show were virtually tied.[64] Once O'Brien took over Tonight, however, Letterman closed the gap in the ratings.[65][66][67] O'Brien initially drove the median age of Tonight Show viewers from 55 to 45, with most older viewers opting to watch The Late Show instead.[68]
Letterman's shows have garnered both critical and industry praise, receiving 67 Emmy Award nominations, winning 12 times in his first 20 years in late night television. From 1993 to 2009, Letterman ranked higher than Leno in the annual Harris Poll of Nation's Favorite TV Personality 12 times.[70] For example, in 2003 and 2004 Letterman ranked second in that poll, behind only Oprah Winfrey, a year that Leno was ranked fifth.[71] Leno was higher than Letterman on that poll three times during the same period, in 1998, 2007, and 2008.[70]
On March 27, 1995, Letterman acted as the host for the 67th Academy Awards ceremony. Critics blasted Letterman for what they deemed a poor hosting of the Oscars, noting that his irreverent style undermined the traditional importance and glamor of the event.[72] In a joke about their unusual names (inspired by a celebrated comic essay in The New Yorker, "Yma Dream" by Thomas Meehan), he started off by introducing Uma Thurman to Oprah Winfrey, and then both of them to Keanu Reeves: "Oprah...Uma. Uma...Oprah," "Have you kids met Keanu?"[73] This and many of his other jokes fell flat.[72] Although Letterman attracted the highest ratings to the annual telecast since 1983, many felt that the bad publicity garnered by Letterman's hosting caused a decline in the Late Show's ratings.[74]
Letterman recycled the apparent debacle into a long-running gag. On his first show after the Oscars, he joked, "Looking back, I had no idea that thing was being televised." He lampooned his stint two years later, during Billy Crystal's opening Oscar skit, which also parodied the plane-crashing scenes from that year's chief nominated film, The English Patient.
For years afterward, Letterman recounted his hosting the Oscars, although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences continued to hold Letterman in high regard and they had invited him to host the Oscars again.[75][76] On September 7, 2010, he made an appearance on the premiere of the 14th season of The View, and confirmed that he had been considered for hosting again.
On January 14, 2000, a routine check-up revealed that an artery in Letterman's heart was severely obstructed. He was rushed to emergency surgery for a quintuple bypass.[77]
During the initial weeks of his recovery, reruns of the Late Show were shown and introduced by friends of Letterman including Drew Barrymore,[67] Ray Romano, Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Megan Mullally, Bill Murray, Regis Philbin, Charles Grodin, Nathan Lane, Julia Roberts,[67] Bruce Willis, Jerry Seinfeld, Martin Short, Steven Seagal, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Danny DeVito, Steve Martin, and Sarah Jessica Parker.
Subsequently, while still recovering from surgery, Letterman revived the late night tradition that had virtually disappeared on network television during the 1990s of 'guest hosts' by allowing Bill Cosby, Kathie Lee Gifford (recommended by Regis Philbin, who was asked first but had no time in his schedule), Dana Carvey, Janeane Garofalo, and others to host new episodes of The Late Show. Cosby—the show's first guest host—refused to sit at Letterman's desk out of respect, using the couch instead; Garofalo followed suit, using a set of grade-school desks instead.
Upon his return to the show on February 21, 2000, Letterman brought all but one of the doctors and nurses on stage who had participated in his surgery and recovery (with extra teasing of a nurse who had given him bed baths—"This woman has seen me naked!"),[78] including Dr. O. Wayne Isom and physician Louis Aronne, who frequently appears on the show. In a show of emotion, Letterman was nearly in tears as he thanked the health care team with the words "These are the people who saved my life!" The episode earned an Emmy nomination. For a number of episodes, Letterman continued to crack jokes about his bypass, including saying, "Bypass surgery: it's when doctors surgically create new blood flow to your heart. A bypass is what happened to me when I didn't get The Tonight Show! It's a whole different thing." In a later running gag he lobbied his home state of Indiana to rename the freeway circling Indianapolis (I-465) "The David Letterman Bypass." He also featured a montage of faux news coverage of his bypass surgery, which included a clip of Dave's heart for sale on the Home Shopping Network. Letterman became friends with his doctors and nurses. In 2008, a Rolling Stone interview stated "he hosted a doctor and nurse who'd helped perform the emergency quintuple-bypass heart surgery that saved his life in 2000. 'These are people who were complete strangers when they opened my chest,' he says. 'And now, eight years later, they're among my best friends.' "[79]
Additionally, Letterman invited the band Foo Fighters to play "Everlong",[80] introducing them as "my favorite band, playing my favorite song."[81] During a later Foo Fighters appearance, Letterman said that Foo Fighters had been in the middle of a South American tour which they canceled to come play on his comeback episode.
Letterman again handed over the reins of the show to several guest hosts (including Bill Cosby, Brad Garrett, Elvis Costello, John McEnroe, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Bonnie Hunt, Luke Wilson and bandleader Paul Shaffer) in February 2003, when he was diagnosed with a severe case of shingles. Later that year, Letterman made regular use of guest hosts—including Tom Arnold and Kelsey Grammer—for new shows broadcast on Fridays. In March 2007, Adam Sandler—who had been scheduled to be the lead guest—served as a guest host while Letterman was ill with a stomach virus.[82]
In March 2002, as Letterman's contract with CBS neared expiration, ABC offered him the time slot for long-running news program Nightline with Ted Koppel. Letterman was interested as he believed he could never match Leno's ratings at CBS due to Letterman's complaint of weaker lead-ins from the network's late local news programs, but was reluctant to replace Koppel.[83] Letterman addressed his decision to re-sign on the air, stating that he was content at CBS and that he had great respect for Koppel.
On December 4, 2006, CBS revealed that Letterman signed a new contract to host The Late Show with David Letterman through the fall of 2010. "I'm thrilled to be continuing on at CBS," said Letterman. "At my age you really don't want to have to learn a new commute."[84] Letterman further joked about the subject by pulling up his right pants leg, revealing a tattoo, presumably temporary, of the ABC logo.
"Thirteen years ago, David Letterman put CBS late night on the map and in the process became one of the defining icons of our network," said Leslie Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Corporation. "His presence on our air is an ongoing source of pride, and the creativity and imagination that the Late Show puts forth every night is an ongoing display of the highest quality entertainment. We are truly honored that one of the most revered and talented entertainers of our time will continue to call CBS 'home.'"[85]
According to a 2007 article in Forbes magazine, Letterman earned $40 million a year.[86] A 2009 article in The New York Times, however, said his salary was estimated at $32 million per year.[87] In June 2009, Letterman's Worldwide Pants and CBS reached agreement to continue the Late Show until at least August 2012. The previous contract had been set to expire in 2010, and the two-year extension is shorter than the typical three-year contract period negotiated in the past.[87] Worldwide Pants agreed to lower its fee for the show, though it had remained a "solid moneymaker for CBS" under the previous contract.[87]
On the February 3, 2011, edition of the Late Show, during an interview with Howard Stern, Letterman said he would continue to do his talk show for "maybe two years, I think."[88]
In April 2012, CBS announced it had extended its contract with Letterman through 2014.[89] His contract was subsequently extended to 2015.[90]
During the taping of his April 3, 2014 show, David Letterman announced that he had informed CBS president Leslie Moonves that he will be retiring from hosting The Late Show in 2015.[6][7]
The Late Show went off air for eight weeks during the months of November and December because of the Writers Guild of America strike. Letterman's production company—Worldwide Pants—was the first company to make an individual agreement with the WGA,[91] thus allowing his show to come back on air on January 2, 2008. On his first episode since being off air, he surprised the viewing audience with his newly grown beard, which signified solidarity with the strike.[92] His beard was shaved off during the show on January 7, 2008.
On June 8 and June 9, 2009, Letterman told a sexually-themed joke on his show each night about a daughter of Sarah Palin.[93] Palin was in New York City at the time with her fourteen year-old daughter, Willow, and the jokes were said to be aimed at the daughter, never named, who was visiting New York City with her mother.[93] Palin criticized the jokes, saying in a statement posted on the internet that "I doubt he'd ever dare make such comments about anyone else's daughter," and "laughter incited by sexually-perverted comments made by a 62-year-old male celebrity aimed at a 14-year-old girl" is "disgusting."[94] On June 10, Letterman responded to the controversy on his show by stating that the jokes were meant to be about Palin's eighteen year-old daughter, Bristol, whose pregnancy as an unmarried teenager had caused controversy during the 2008 Presidential election, and that "(t)hese are not jokes made about (Palin's) 14-year-old daughter. I would never, never make jokes about raping or having sex of any description with a 14-year-old girl."[94] His remarks didn't put an end to the public criticism, however, with the National Organization for Women, who supported Palin in a statement, noting he had given only "something of an apology."[93] With the controversy not subsiding, Letterman addressed the issue again on his June 15 show, faulting himself for the error and apologizing "especially to the two daughters involved, Bristol and Willow, and also to the governor and her family and everybody else who was outraged by the joke."[95]
Johnny Carson in 1994 (pictured here shortly after his 1992 retirement) was an inspiration and mentor to Letterman
In spite of Johnny Carson's clear intention to pass his title to Letterman, NBC selected Jay Leno to host The Tonight Show after Carson's departure.[96] Letterman maintained a close relationship with Carson through his break with NBC. Three years after he left for CBS, HBO produced a made-for-television movie called The Late Shift, based on a book by New York Times reporter Bill Carter, chronicling the battle between Letterman and Leno for the coveted Tonight Show hosting spot. Letterman would mock the film for months afterward, specifically on how the actor playing him, John Michael Higgins, did not resemble him in the least.[citation needed]
Carson later made a few cameo appearances as a guest on Letterman's show. Carson's final television appearance came May 13, 1994, on a Late Show episode taped in Los Angeles, when he made a surprise appearance during a 'Top 10 list' segment. The audience went wild as Letterman stood up and proudly invited Carson to sit at his desk. The applause was so protracted that Carson was unable to say anything, and he finally returned backstage as the applause continued. (It was later explained that Carson had laryngitis, though Carson can be heard talking to Letterman during his appearance.)
In early 2005, it was revealed that Carson occasionally sent jokes to Letterman, who used these jokes in his monologue; according to CBS senior vice president Peter Lassally (a one-time producer for both men), Carson got "a big kick out of it."[97] Letterman would do a characteristic Johnny Carson golf swing after delivering one of Carson's jokes. In a tribute to Carson, all of the opening monologue jokes during the first show following Carson's death were written by Carson.
Lassally also claimed that Carson had always believed Letterman, not Leno, to be his "rightful successor."[98] During the early years of The Late Show's run, Letterman occasionally used some of Carson's trademark bits, including "Carnac the Magnificent" (with Paul Shaffer as Carnac), "Stump the Band", and the "Week in Review."
Letterman had a long-term feud with daytime talk show host Oprah Winfrey which culminated in the two making several media appearances together
Oprah Winfrey appeared on Letterman's show when he was hosting NBC's Late Night on May 2, 1989. Following that appearance, the two had a 16-year feud which according to Letterman started when he and his girlfriend decided to skip out on a bill, tricking the waiter into thinking Oprah agreed to pay it.[99]
The feud apparently ended in 2005 when Winfrey appeared on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on December 2, in an event Letterman jokingly referred to as "the Super Bowl of Love".[100]
Winfrey and Letterman also appeared together in a Late Show promo that aired during CBS's coverage of Super Bowl XLI in February 2007, with the two sitting next to each other on the couch watching the game. Since the game was played between the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears, the Indianapolis-born Letterman wears a Peyton Manning jersey, while Winfrey—who tapes her show in Chicago—is in a Brian Urlacher jersey.[101] On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. He shared pictures of his son and future wife, Regina Lasko.
Three years later, during CBS's coverage of Super Bowl XLIV, the two appeared again in a Late Show promo, this time with Winfrey sitting on a couch between Letterman and Jay Leno. The appearance was Letterman's idea: Leno flew to New York City on an NBC corporate jet, sneaking into the Ed Sullivan Theater during the Late Show's February 4 taping wearing a disguise, meeting Winfrey and Letterman at a living room set created in the theater's balcony where they taped their promo.[102]
Winfrey interviewed Letterman in January 2013 on Oprah's Next Chapter. Winfrey and Letterman discussed their feud during the interview and Winfrey revealed that she had had a "terrible experience" while appearing on Letterman's show years earlier. Letterman could not recall the incident but apologized.[103]
On August 17, 2011, it was reported that a Muslim militant had posted a death threat against Letterman on a website frequented by Al-Qaeda supporters, calling on American Muslims to kill Letterman for making a joke about the death of an Al-Qaeda leader killed in a drone strike in Pakistan in June 2011.[104] In his show on August 22, Letterman joked about the threat, saying "State Department authorities are looking into this. They're not taking this lightly. They're looking into it. They're questioning, they're interrogating, there's an electronic trail—but everybody knows it's Leno."[105]
Letterman appeared in issue 239 of the Marvel comic book The Avengers, in which the title characters are guests on Late Night.[106] A parody of Letterman, named "David Endochrine," is gassed to death along with his bandleader named "Paul" and their audience in Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns.[107]
Letterman appeared in the pilot episode of the short-lived 1986 series "Coach Toast", and he appears with a bag over his head as a guest on Bonnie Hunt's ca. 1993 sitcom The Building. He also appears in The Simpsons, as himself in a couch gag when The Simpsons find themselves (and the couch) in "Late Night with David Letterman." He had a cameo in the feature film Cabin Boy, with Chris Elliott, who worked as a writer on Letterman's show. In this and other appearances, Letterman is listed in the credits as "Earl Hofert", the name of Letterman's maternal grandfather. He also appeared as himself in the Howard Stern biopic Private Parts as well as the 1999 Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon, in a few episodes of Garry Shandling's 1990s TV series The Larry Sanders Show and in "The Abstinence", a 1996 episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. Letterman also made an uncredited appearance in the first episode of the third season of the sitcom The Nanny.
Letterman provided vocals for the Warren Zevon song "Hit Somebody" from My Ride's Here,[108] and provided the voice for Butt-head's father in the 1996 animated film Beavis and Butt-head Do America.
In 2010, a documentary Dying to Do Letterman was released directed by Joke Fincioen and Biagio Messina featuring Steve Mazan, a stand up comic, who has cancer and wants to appear on the Letterman Show. The film won Best Documentary and Jury Awards at the Cinequest Film Festival.[109] Steve Mazan published a same-titled book (full title, Dying to Do Letterman: Turning Someday into Today) about his own saga.[110]
Known for rarely giving interviews,[citation needed] Letterman appeared as a guest on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight on May 29, 2012, where he was interviewed by Regis Philbin, the guest host and long-time friend.
In June 2013, he appeared in the second episode of season two of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.[111]
On November 5, 2013, Letterman and Bruce McCall published a fiction satire book titled This Land Was Made for You and Me (But Mostly Me). ISBN 0-399-16368-9
Letterman started his own production company—Worldwide Pants Incorporated—which produced his show and several others, including Everybody Loves Raymond, The Late Late Show, and two television series for Bonnie Hunt. Worldwide Pants also produced the dramedy program Ed, which aired on NBC from 2000–2004. It was Letterman's first association with NBC since he left the network in 1993. During Ed's run, the star, Tom Cavanagh, appeared as a guest on The Late Show several times.
In 2005, Worldwide Pants produced its first feature film, Strangers with Candy, which was a prequel to the Comedy Central TV series of the same title. In 2007, Worldwide Pants produced the ABC comedy series, Knights of Prosperity.
Worldwide Pants made significant news in December 2007 when it was announced that Letterman's company had independently negotiated its own contract with the Writers Guild of America, East, thus allowing Letterman, Craig Ferguson, and their writers to return to work, while the union continued its strike against production companies, networks and studios who had not reached an agreement.
In late April 2010, several music industry websites reported that Letterman started a record label named Clear Entertainment/C.E. Music and signed his first artist, Runner Runner.[112][113] Lucy Walsh announced on her MySpace page that she has been signed by Letterman and Clear Entertainment/C.E. Music and is working on her album.
Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing (RLLR) is an auto racing team that currently races in the American Le Mans Series, and full-time in the IZOD IndyCar Series. It is co-owned by 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, businessman Mike Lanigan, and Letterman himself, and is based in Hilliard, Ohio. The team won the 2004 Indianapolis 500 with driver Buddy Rice.
The Letterman Foundation for Courtesy and Grooming is a private foundation through which Letterman has donated millions of dollars to charities and other non-profits in Indiana and Montana, celebrity-affiliated organizations such as Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, universities such as Ball State, and other organizations such as the American Cancer Society, Salvation Army, and Doctors Without Borders.
In 1969, Letterman married Michelle Cook; the marriage ended by divorce in 1977.[citation needed] He also had a relationship with former head writer and producer on Late Night, Merrill Markoe. Markoe was the mind behind several Late Night staples, such as "Stupid Pet/Human Tricks".[114]
Letterman and Regina Lasko started dating in 1986, while he was still living with Markoe. He has a son, Harry Joseph Letterman (born on November 3, 2003), with her. Harry is named after Letterman's father.[115] In 2005, police discovered a plot to kidnap Harry Letterman and ransom him for $5 million. Kelly Frank, a house painter who had worked for Letterman, was charged in the conspiracy.[116]
Letterman and Lasko wed on March 19, 2009, during a quiet courthouse civil ceremony in Choteau, Montana, where he purchased a ranch in 1999.[117][118][119] Letterman announced the marriage during the taping of his March 23 show, shortly after congratulating Bruce Willis for getting married the previous week. Letterman told the audience he nearly missed the ceremony because his truck became stuck in mud two miles from their house.[120] The family resides in North Salem, New York, on a 108-acre estate.[121]
Letterman suffers from tinnitus (ringing in the ears), which is a symptom of hearing loss. He talked about his tinnitus in an interview he did with actor William Shatner on the Late Show in 1996 where he said he hears constant noises and ringing in his ears 24 hours a day. [122][123]
Beginning in May 1988, Letterman was stalked by Margaret Mary Ray, a woman suffering from schizophrenia. She stole his Porsche, camped out on his tennis court, and repeatedly broke into his house. Her exploits drew national attention, with Letterman occasionally joking about her on his show, although he never referred to her by name. After she committed suicide in October 1998, Letterman told the New York Times that he had great compassion for her.[124] "This is a sad ending to a confused life," said a spokesman for Letterman.[125]
On his October 1, 2009, show, Letterman announced that he had been the victim of a blackmail attempt by someone threatening to reveal that he had had sex with several of his female employees, and at the same time, he confirmed that he had had such relationships.[126] He stated that three weeks earlier (on September 9, 2009) someone had left a package in his car with material he said he would write into a screenplay and a book if Letterman did not pay him $2 million. Letterman said that he contacted the Manhattan District Attorney's office, ultimately cooperating with them to conduct a sting operation involving giving the man a phony check.[127] Subsequently, Robert J. "Joe" Halderman, a producer of the CBS true crime journalism series 48 Hours, was arrested after trying to deposit the check. He was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury and pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted grand larceny on October 2, 2009.[128] Eventually, on March 9, 2010, he pleaded guilty to this same felony and served a 6-month jail sentence, followed by probation and community service.[129]
A central figure in the case and one of the women with whom Letterman had had a sexual relationship was his longtime personal assistant Stephanie Birkitt, who often appeared with him on his show. She had also worked for 48 Hours.[130] Until a month prior to the revelations, she had shared a residence with Halderman,[131] who allegedly had copied her personal diary and used it, along with private emails, in the blackmail package.[132]
In the days following the initial announcement of the affairs and the arrest, several prominent women, including Kathie Lee Gifford, co-host of NBC's Today Show, and NBC news anchor Ann Curry questioned whether Letterman's affairs with subordinates created an unfair working environment.[133] A spokesman for Worldwide Pants said that the company's sexual harassment policy did not prohibit sexual relationships between managers and employees.[134] According to business news reporter Eve Tahmincioglu, "CBS suppliers are supposed to follow the company's business conduct policies" and the CBS 2008 Business Conduct Statement states that "If a consenting romantic or sexual relationship between a supervisor and a direct or indirect subordinate should develop, CBS requires the supervisor to disclose this information to his or her Company's Human Resources Department...".[135]
On October 5, 2009, Letterman devoted a segment of his show to a public apology to his wife and staff.[136][137] Three days later, Worldwide Pants announced that Birkitt had been placed on a "paid leave of absence" from the Late Show.[138] On October 15, CBS News announced that the company's Chief Investigative Correspondent, Armen Keteyian, had been assigned to conduct an "in-depth investigation" into Halderman's blackmail of Letterman.[139]
On October 3, 2009, a former CBS employee, Holly Hester, announced that she and Letterman had engaged in a year-long "secret" affair in the early 1990s while she was his intern and a student at New York University.[140]
In his capacities as either a writer, producer, performer, or as part of a writing team, Letterman is among the most nominated people in Emmy Award history with 52 nominations, winning two Daytime Emmys and five Primetime Emmys since 1981. His nomination record is second only to producer Jac Venza, who holds the record for the most Emmy nominations for an individual (57).[citation needed] Letterman was nominated every year from 1984 to 2010.[citation needed] He won four American Comedy Awards and in 2011 became the first recipient of the Johnny Carson Award for Comedic Excellence at The Comedy Awards.
Letterman was a recipient of the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors, where he was called "one of the most influential personalities in the history of television, entertaining an entire generation of late-night viewers with his unconventional wit and charm."[141][142]
On September 7, 2007, Letterman visited his alma mater, Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, for the dedication of a communications facility named in his honor for his dedication to the university. The $21 million, 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) David Letterman Communication and Media Building opened for the 2007 fall semester. Thousands of Ball State students, faculty, and local residents welcomed Letterman back to Indiana.[143] Letterman's emotional speech touched on his struggles as a college student and his late father, and also included the "top ten good things about having your name on a building", finishing with, "if reasonable people can put my name on a $21 million building, anything is possible."[144] Over many years Letterman "has provided substantial assistance to [Ball State's] Department of Telecommunications, including an annual scholarship that bears his name."[145]
At the same time, Letterman also received a Sagamore of the Wabash award given by Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, which recognizes distinguished service to the state of Indiana.[143]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Television would never be the same after David Letterman made his second attempt at a television show in 1982. But his career before becoming host of the show was quite an interesting and long one. Letterman was born in Broad Ripple, a neighborhood in Indianapolis. His childhood was relatively unremarkable, but he exhibited tendencies of the class clown and showed a very strong independent streak as a child. Letterman went on to graduate from Ball State University in the late 1960s and married Michelle Cook in 1969. From 1970 to 1974, he worked as a weatherman and TV announcer and from 1974 to 1975 as a radio talk show host.As the late 1970s approached, Letterman was working as a struggling stand-up comic at The Comedy Store and started writing for television shows. He wrote for the summer series "The Peeping Times" and for such shows as Good Times (1974). Letterman had become something of a minor celebrity by 1978, by which time he had appeared on The Gong Show (1976), Mary Tyler Moore's variety series, Mary (1978), Liar's Club (1976), The $10,000 Pyramid (1973), Password Plus (1979) and the variety series, The Starland Vocal Band Show (1977). (It was also revealed on the Game Show Network that Letterman hosted a pilot of a game show in the seventies called The Riddlers (1977), but it was not made into a series.)This exposure prompted many appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962). He became so popular that he was permanent substitute host by the end of the 1970s. NBC saw great potential in the young irreverent comedian, so they gave Letterman his own daytime talk show, The David Letterman Show (1980), which was a disaster and aired for only a few months. At about this time, Tom Snyder was having problems with his late-night show, The Tomorrow Show (1973), which aired after the "Tonight Show." His problems were mostly with his co-host, Rona Barrett, and Snyder was forced off air in late 1981. Letterman, who was still permanent co-host of the "Tonight Show," took over the post-Carson slot with Late Night with David Letterman (1982).Letterman's show was extremely unconventional. For starters, Letterman was very political, whereas Johnny Carson had steered away from political jokes. Letterman's early antics changed talk shows. He would often stage elevator races in Radio City Music Hall. He made random calls to strangers and talked about the strangest subjects. At one point, Letterman got his associate Larry "Bud" Melman to stand outside the Russian Embassy and hand out pamphlets encouraging defection. He often made his guests feel uncomfortable with his intelligent and abrasive style, and guests often participated in funny and unusual skits with him. Letterman became almost an instant success, and some say he surpassed Carson in popularity.As the late 1980s approached, Letterman was becoming more and more of a household name, often at odds with the censors over his show, and never one to kowtow to guests' wishes. But that only made him more popular, and he garnered more and more status as a world class talk show host. Among the more classic moments in his early show was the time he covered his suit with Alka Seltzer and jumped in a vat of water. Letterman helped Andy Kaufman with his wrestling saga, as Kaufman and Jerry Lawler pretended to get in a fight on "Late Night." Letterman also became known for his on-screen reclusiveness with respect to other shows. While Carson at one point in his career would often make cameos and guest appearances, Letterman would shy away from cameos and stuck almost solely to doing his "Late Night" show.In 1992 Johnny Carson made a landmark announcement: he was retiring. Many thought that Letterman would be the natural choice as Carson's replacement, but many at NBC were leaning toward current "Tonight Show" substitute host Jay Leno. The battle was very public and very vicious, but in the end Leno won out, and Letterman continued hosting the post-"Tonight Show" slot. But, in 1993, Letterman made his own big announcement: he was leaving NBC for a lucrative contract with CBS to star in the Late Show with David Letterman (1993). The battle intensified even more. NBC claimed that many of Letterman's gimmicks and jokes, including throwing the pencil at the camera, the Top Ten List, and Larry "Bud" Melman, among many others, were NBC's "intellectual property." NBC lost, but Larry "Bud" Melman would now be called by his real name, Calvert DeForest, on the CBS show. Competing in the late night wars with not only Leno but also Chevy Chase, Arsenio Hall and Ted Koppel, Letterman consistently won over all of his competition until the summer of 1995, when Leno had guest Hugh Grant on his show to discuss his highly publicized arrest for being caught with prostitute Divine Brown and Grant cried on screen. The ratings were tremendous, and Leno has consistently beaten Letterman ever since.In recent years, Letterman has toned down his act. He dresses more conservatively and tends to go the more traditional route of talk shows. It can be said that every talk show since, including Craig Kilborn and especially 'Conan O'Brien', has been influenced a great deal by Letterman's unconventional, irreverent, off-the-wall style. It was thought that Letterman was going to retire in the mid-'90s, but an impressive $14 million-per-year deal has kept Letterman with CBS. Near-tragedy struck, however, in January of 2000 when Letterman was diagnosed with coronary arterial blockage and underwent quintuple bypass surgery. The operation was successful, however, and Letterman received countless get-well cards and a great deal of publicity. Among David's better-known incidents in recent years have been Drew Barrymore's infamous table dance, an interview with a bizarre and ditzy Farrah Fawcett, his appearance in the movie, Cabin Boy (1994) (written by and starring his former "Late Night" writer and performer Chris Elliott), his stint as host of The 67th Annual Academy Awards (1995), and his appearance in the Andy Kaufman biopic, Man on the Moon (1999). When Politically Incorrect (1993) was canceled in 2002, Letterman was sought after to leave CBS for ABC, but he declined to do so and stayed with CBS, where he will probably remain for quite a while.Aside from being a talk show host, Letterman is an active producer. His production company is called Worldwide Pants. Over the years he has been executive producer of his original show, his new show, Everybody Loves Raymond (1996), The Building (1993), The Bonnie Hunt Show (1995), The High Life (1996), The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn (1999), and Ed (2000).
      Began a relationship with his second wife, Regina Lasko, in February of 1986; they did not marry until March 19th, 2009.
      Allegedly, he will not stay for longer than five minutes for an on-location cameo appearance in any given film, which may be why Letterman doesn't really "appear" on stage with Jim Carrey and Jerry Lawler in Man on the Moon (1999), but rather is a special-effects image, like a cut-and-paste.
      Is part owner of Team Rahal auto racing team (majority owner Bobby Rahal, 1986 Indianapolis 500 champion).
      While working as a weatherman in Indianapolis, he once congratulated a tropical storm for being upgraded to a hurricane.
      Before his heart bypass surgery, he had not missed a day due to illness in his 18 years of late-night.
      Multi-purpose names he uses for any man: "Larry," "Kenny," and "Rodney". Multi-purpose names for women: "Linda".
      Nicknames for Paul Shaffer include "Johnny Carwash", "Wayne 'Fatboy' Ewing" and "Paul W. Shaffer."
      His father, Joe Letterman, was a florist who died of a heart attack in 1973. Mother Dorothy Mengering remarried in 1983 to Hans Mengering.
      He once hosted a game show pilot called The Riddlers (1977). Its celebrity guests were Joyce Bulifant, Michael McKean, Debralee Scott, Robert Urich and Jo Anne Worley. (The pilot was shown on the Game Show Network on 28 October 2000.).
      He was frequently a celebrity guest on TV game shows of the 1970s, among them The $10,000 Pyramid (1973), The Gong Show (1976), and Liar's Club (1976).
      Was a resident of New Canaan, Connecticut, but moved to Westchester County, New York, around 2001.
      He went to college with Jim Davis, another Indiana native who created and still writes the world famous comic strip "Garfield."
      Once petitioned to get a highway in his hometown named "the Dave Letterman Bypass" as a reference to his heart bypass surgery. Businesses in Indianapolis referred to the highway as "The Dave" for a short time.
      On 3 November 2003, Letterman's then-girlfriend (now his wife), Regina Lasko, gave birth to their son, Harry Joseph Letterman, named after Letterman's father, who passed away at the age of 57.
      2003 was the 19th year in a row that his show, be it Late Show with David Letterman (1993) (CBS) or Late Night with David Letterman (1982) (NBC) received an Emmy nomination for writing on a variety series.
      Just won as a car owner in the Indy 500 (5-30-04) with co-owner Bobby Rahal and winner Buddy Rice.
      He often does an in-joke that only his studio audience will understand. This is done by speaking with the audience before taping begins and finding out where people are from, what they do, etc. During the opening monologue, he will then make a reference to one of the audience members.
      Was a writer on the 1970s comedy series Good Times (1974), as was his current late night talk show competitor Jay Leno.
      On his shows he has mentioned to both Gene Siskel and Martin Scorsese that his favorite movie is Sergio Leone's C'era una volta il West (1968).
      Has mentioned on the Late Show with David Letterman (1993) that his favorite song is The Spinners's "I'll Be Around (Whenever You Want Me)." On the July 27, 2006 broadcast, The Spinners appeared on the show, playing "I'll Be Around" with Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra.
      At one time was a part owner of the Seattle Mariners, courtesy of then-owner, Jeff Smulyan, as he gave Letterman shares of his company, Emmis Communications, which included the Mariners (Letterman was given about 1%).
      In February 2003, an emergency group of guest hosts had to be called to fill in on the Late Show with David Letterman (1993), when Letterman was suddenly debilitated with a bout of shingles.
      Had a running gag with Indianapolis radio station WNAP during the 1970s. He would telephone in comedic "reports", allegedly from the Indiana State Fair, using the name Moferd Pardo.
      Early in his television career, Dave did some ring announcing work for an Indianapolis wrestling promotion run by Dick the Bruiser (Dick Afflis). Years later on NBC, Dave nicknamed his band "The World's Most Dangerous Band", based on Dick the Bruiser's nickname of "The World's Most Dangerous Wrestler".
      Pencils used at his talk show desk have erasers at both ends. This is so no one is injured when he throws them.
      Married his second wife Regina Lasko in a courthouse ceremony near their ranch home in Montana.
      Recipient of the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors. Other recipient that year were Buddy Guy, Dustin Hoffman, Natalia Makarova, and the rock band Led Zeppelin, comprising John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant.
      In August, Dave will celebrate 10 years as host of the 6 time consecutive Emmy Award winning CBS show Late Show with David Letterman (1993). [February 2003]
      His father had English, Scots-Irish, and German ancestry. His mother's family was of German descent.
      We can all sleep easy at night knowing that somewhere at any given time, the Foo Fighters are out there fighting Foo.
      [Jay Leno on Letterman] "Dave is one of the few performers who can say something real vicious and have it come across as a cute aside."
      "Each and every Thursday night, we like to go out in the audience of the Ed Sullivan Theater to play America's fastest growing quiz sensation, Know Your Current Events".
      The weather's so cold in New York right now. And when I walked through Central Park this morning, I saw a squirrel warming up his nuts!
      [on his move to the Westinghouse-owned CBS television network[] "I now have a lifetime's supply of light bulbs."
      [on being called a non-voting Republican] "I believe I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans. Am I either one? Absolutely not. Ladies and gentlemen, I am an American."
      It's very simple. There's only one requirement of any of us, and that is to be courageous. Because courage, as you might know, defines all other human behavior. And, I believe - because I've done a little of this myself - pretending to be courageous is just as good as the real thing.
      [on becoming a father for the first time at 56] "By the time the child has trouble in life, you know, I'll be dead. I'll be long gone. By the time the kid's out stealing cars, you know, Dad will be dead a few years."
      [on his close friend Jay Leno in 1986] "'Jay's a master at getting the audience on his side. He's able to communicate the idea that 'Shouldn't we, as a group, think this is absurd?' You immediately feel like he's your ally".
      [on his first show after the September 11th terrorist attacks] "It's said they were motivated by religious fervor. And if you live to be a thousand, will that make any sense to you? Will that make any goddamn sense?"
      [about the type of guests he likes] "I don't care who you are, I don't care what you do. If you have four funny stories, you can be a guest on this show. That's what we're looking for."
      [on dealing with cold winters] Here's a tip: take your boxer shorts and put them in the microwave. It's a tip I learned from Rosie O'Donnell.
      [following an Islamist threat against his life] Tonight, you people are more than an audience. You're more like a human shield.

Birth Name: David Michael LettermanBirth Place: Indianapolis, INDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 04/12/1947, AriesProfession: TV talk-show host; comedy writer; comedian; television producer
After stints as a weatherman, news anchor and stand-up comic, this sarcastic gap-toothed performer came to prominence in the 1980s with a late-night talk show on NBC. His offbeat signature bits (Tonight's Top 10, Stupid Pet Tricks), surly attitude and frequent send-ups of the entertainment industry made him a hit with critics and viewers. When NBC failed to give Letterman The Tonight Show after Johnny Carson retired, the disgruntled comedian jumped to CBS in 1993 and began hosting The Late Show With David Letterman. His long-term relationship with girlfriend and collaborator Merrill Markoe ended in 1987, and at age 56 he had a son with girlfriend Regina Lasko, whom he later married on March 19, 2009 (after dating her for 23 years). Letterman tries to be fanatically secretive about his private life, but this plan went off course in the wake of an extortion case in the fall of 2009, when he helped the Manhattan DA's office arrest a man who blackmailed him over information regarding his relationships with several female staffers. Off screen, Letterman is the co-owner of the Rahal Letterman Racing Team, which won the Indy 500 in 2004.David Letterman Fast Facts:

David Letterman was born ...: ... On April 12, 1947, in Indianapolis, Indiana.  His father, a florist, died in 1974.  His mother, Dorothy, is a church secretary and frequent guest on his program, Late Show with David Letterman. He has two sisters. Growing up with Dave: After high school, Dave ventured to Ball State University, where he graduated in 1969 with a degree in telecommunications.  During his four years at Ball State, Dave got his first taste of broadcasting as a disc jockey on student-run radio station WAGO-AM 570.Dave’s first job:After graduation, Dave moved right into television and radio, working as both a radio deejay and as a weatherman on Indianapolis' WTHR.  It;;s here, the legend goes, that Letterman famously referred to hail as "the size of canned hams."  The Early Years:Creative juices flowing, Dave moved to Los Angeles in 1975 to pursue a career in show business.  He worked various jobs: sit-com writer, stand-up comic, and as a cast member on Mary Tyler Moore's variety show, Mary.  His unique, deadpan humor caught the attention of Johnny Carson, and Dave was soon a regular guest on The Tonight Show.  Becoming a talk show host:Probably in 1978, when he started guest hosting The Tonight Show. His success in that enormous venue led to his own television program, The David Letterman Show, which aired, unsuccessfully, in the morning hours.
After its cancellation (it was on for just a summer), things moved forward with a revamped idea - same David Letterman, same sense of humor, different time slot.  In 1982, Late Night with David Letterman debuted.A key moment in his career: His decision to leave NBC after 11 years, sparked by NBC’s announcement that Jay Leno would take over Carson's spot as host of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  Though nothing is certain, the story suggests that Dave, bitter about the network's decision, was advised by Carson to leave the network altogether.
The "shift" saw Dave land at CBS with The Late Show, Jay on Tonight, and unknown Conan O'Brien taking over Late Night. What does the future hold?:More comedy, more antics, and a more subdued David Letterman.  After quintuple bypass surgery in 2000, Dave has been a bit kinder and gentler.  He seems more relaxed and comfortable in his role as king of late night, less concerned with ratings and whatnot.  It's a good Dave, a better Dave, one that more closely resembles the Dave we fell in love with 25 years ago.And Just For Fun:Was a good friend of Johnny Carson.  Carson often sent Dave jokes to use in his monologue.  The day after Carson’s death, Dave filled his monologue with jokes written by Carson.
Dave is a racing fan - not unexpected having grown up in Indianapolis.  He owns an Indy Racing League team, Rahal Letterman Racing, with racing legend Bobby Rahal.
Ended a "so-called feud" with Oprah Winfrey (neither admits to knowing what the feud was about) in 2005, when Oprah appeared on his show for the first time in 16 years.
 In 1985, Letterman established the Letterman Telecommunications Scholarship at Ball State, which provides financial assistance to students, based solely on his or her creativity, and not high academic grades.

David LettermanTalk Show HostBorn: 12 April 1947Birthplace: Indianapolis, IndianaBest known as: Host of The Late Show With David LettermanDavid Letterman has been a late-night TV show host for more than 30 years. His show Late Night With David Letterman premiered on February 1982 on NBC, where it followed the famed Tonight Show hosted by Johnny Carson. Letterman's show became a huge hit with college students and night owls, justly famous for its offbeat humor and nightly "Top Ten" lists. Letterman's background was eclectic: he graduated from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana in 1969, and was once an all-purpose announcer on station WLWI in Indianapolis, a job which included introducing movies and serving as a substitute weatherman. He worked his way into stand-up comedy (appearing on Carson's show in 1978) and wrote and performed on various comedy shows, including his own failed morning show on NBC. He clicked almost immediately in the late-night spot, and his show was a hit throughout the 1980s. Letterman later made no secret of his wish to host the Tonight Show once Carson retired; when NBC gave that job to Jay Leno in 1992, Letterman jumped to CBS and began the competing The Late Show with David Letterman. He's been a fixture on CBS ever since. On 1 October 2009, Letterman stunned his audience by announcing on his show he was the victim of an extortion attempt by a CBS employee, who threatened to reveal that Letterman had slept with unnamed female staffers from his show. Letterman admitted that the claim was true, and the incident eventually blew over. On March 3 of 2014, he announced on the air that he would retire on an unnamed date in 2015.Extra credit: David Letterman married his girlfriend of 23 years, Regina Lasko, on 19 March 2009. They have a son, Harry, born in 2003... He was married to college sweetheart Michelle Cook from 1970-1977... An auto racing enthusiast, he formed the Rahal Letterman racing team with former driver Bobby Rahal... In January of 2000, David Letterman missed five weeks of shows after undergoing quintuple bypass heart surgery...

David LettermanAKA David Michael LettermanBorn: 12-Apr-1947Birthplace: Indianapolis, INGender: MaleReligion: LutheranRace or Ethnicity: WhiteSexual orientation: StraightOccupation: Talk Show Host, Film/TV ProducerNationality: United StatesExecutive summary: The Late ShowDavid Letterman is a gap-toothed, grouchy, balding and bespectacled comedian, who has been the funniest man on television for more than twenty years.  He is old enough that as a youngster he admired radio star Arthur Godfrey. When Letterman watched The Tonight Show as a boy, the host was Steve Allen and then Jack Paar -- and Letterman was watching. He was 14 when Johnny Carson took over in 1962, and always looked up to Carson as the best of the best, the epitome of comedy and class. For years, Letterman wanted to be Johnny Carson.
Letterman married his college girlfriend, Michelle Cook, a music major, and got his own degree in telecommunications. Then he went to work as a wacky weatherman in Indianapolis, occasionally making up cities that didn't exist ("Eight inches of snow in Bingree and surrounding areas"), and once erasing state borders from a weather map during a broadcast. He anchored the evening news for a short while, and even hosted a news/talk radio show. Too funny to play it serious, though, Letterman starred in a local kiddie show, and wisecracked as host of late night TV "Freeze-Dried Movies" until he quit his job, loaded his possessions into his truck, and left Indiana in 1975.
In Los Angeles, Letterman wrote for Good Times, the Jimmie Walker sitcom. Letterman became popular in local comedy venues, making friends with another young comic, Jay Leno, though Letterman now says he hasn't heard from Leno in years. Letterman wrote songs and comedy for The Starlight Vocal Band Show, and after his stand-up gigs, he cheated on his wife with more than one woman who wanted to catch a rising star.  The marriage ended in 1977, before Letterman had even enough success to be ordered to pay alimony. His ex-wife got custody of the car and the dog.
Over the next few years, Letterman did the daytime game shows (Liars Club, Password, The $10,000 Pyramid, The Gong Show, etc.), and sang and danced (woodenly) on Mary Tyler Moore's short-lived sketch comedy show Mary. When he made his first of dozens of appearances on Carson's Tonight Show, after doing a few minutes of stand-up, he was invited to join Carson on the couch -- at the time, the highest honor any comedian could earn.
His own David Letterman Show debuted in 1980, but it was aired weekday mornings, opposite game shows and soap operas. Wacko actress Edie McClurg was a regular, and the show was humorous, but housewives didn't seem to get the jokes, so the show was cancelled after just a few months. It was nominated for five Emmys, and won two -- one for writing and one for the host.
Letterman's Late Night debuted in 1982. With Paul Shaffer, Chris Elliott, Dwight the troubled teen, gruff but lovable Gus, Larry "Bud" Melman, the NBC bookmobile, and "The Museum of the Hard to Believe", Late Night proved a perfect follow-up to Carson's Tonight Show on NBC. Unlike other talk shows' predictable chats with stars hawking movies or authors selling books, Letterman's interviews were irreverent, unpredictable, smart-alecky and sarcastic. He had memorable on-air spats with a few stars who needed to have their egos punctured, including Cher, Madonna, and Shirley MacLaine.
In 1991, Letterman, well-known for his Connecticut speeding tickets, was involved in an accident in St. Petersburg when his rental Chrysler collided with a pick-up truck in a rain-slicked intersection. The police report found neither driver at fault, but two people in the pick-up were injured. Letterman later visited both, apologizing profusely, and paid $125,000 to settle their medical bills -- apparently without being sued.
In 1992, when Carson retired and NBC announced that Leno would take over The Tonight Show, Letterman felt jilted, or worse, that his career was over. Carson had always been Letterman's idol, and hosting Tonight had always been Letterman's ambition. He had guest-hosted Carson's show exactly 50 times, and Letterman was a guest on Carson's next-to-last Friday night show, ten days before Tonight would be Leno's show. Letterman took the opportunity to offer Carson a job.
"I have a show," said Letterman. "You could be on my show. You could be a guest. You could be a guest host. Come to think of it, you can have the damn thing. Why not? Things ain't that great."  Carson laughed and said, "You're still pissed, huh?"  Even Carson thought Letterman would have been a better choice than Leno to take over Tonight. On Carson's advice, Letterman took his "Top 10" lists and his band leader Shaffer to CBS, and started The Late Show with David Letterman.
Late Show's schtick includes most of the familiar bits from Late Night, as well as "Will it float?", "Is this anything", "Know your current events," "Dr. Phil's words of wisdom," innovative ways to beat the hell out of announcer Alan Kalter, and stagehands' hilariously droll readings of Oprah transcripts. Embarrassed or pissed-off celebrity guests have included Richard Gere and Farrah Fawcett.
Letterman hosted the 1995 Oscar ceremonies, and the telecast had its highest ratings in a dozen years, but critics declared his performance a bomb.  Within a few months of the Oscarcast, Letterman's Late Show went from first place in the ratings to a distant second behind Leno, and it has only rarely been #1 since. Soon, long-time director Hal Gurnee was gone, along with long-time producer Robert Morton and long-time punchline Melman.
In 2000, Letterman had quadruple heart bypass surgery, and returned to his show with a sincere tribute to the doctors who saved his life. "My career flashed before my eyes," he said. "I'm telling you something. It was mostly awkward silences."  Shaffer has said that the experience changed Letterman. Prior to his surgery, the show's staff took memos from CBS execs semi-seriously, and worried about the show's ratings. After the surgery, says Shaffer, Letterman "doesn't give a damn anymore" -- about the suits' memos, the ratings, or anything but whether a gag is funny or not.
Letterman won kudos for his unscripted, teary, heartfelt remarks when The Late Show returned after the 2001 terror attack on New York. He later held hands with a weepy Dan Rather. And beginning in 2002, Letterman has gone to the Middle East to entertain American troops every year at Christmas (Afghanistan in 2002, and Iraq in 2003 and 2004). For his 2004 trip, Letterman brought Ilana, the Late Show Grinder Girl, and Anna, the Hula Hoop Girl. At one point in his act he asked for a volunteer from the crowd, and hundreds of soldiers raised their hands. "Isn't that how you got here?", he asked.
In retirement and until his death, Carson occasionally sent Letterman jokes for his monologue. Letterman responded by using the bits, of course, and eventually said "thank you" by reviving some of Carson's long-running material, including "Stump the Band" and "Carnac the Magnificent," with sidekick Shaffer playing Ed McMahon.
Letterman's most famous stalker, Margaret Ray, was arrested several times for breaking into his house, stealing his car, and claiming to be his wife. After writing him hundreds of letters, she knelt in front of a freight train in 1998. He has had at least two other stalkers, and has bulletproof glass in his office window.
In 1985, Letterman established the a scholarship at Ball State, providing financial assistance to students based solely on their creativity, not their grades. His generous contributions to the school have kept the telecommunications department flush with the latest equipment, acknowledged with an understated plaque which reads, "To all 'C' students before me and after me. --David Letterman."
Letterman was co-owner of the Rahal Letterman Racing team, which won the Indianapolis 500 in 2004 with Buddy Rice driving. For Letterman, an Indianapolis boy and a big racing fan, winning at Indy was a tremendous accomplishment. He reportedly pushed several Emmys aside to give the Indy 500 trophy the most prominent spot on his mantle.
Letterman's company, World Wide Pants, produces The Late Show and The Late, Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and also produced Ray Romano's Everybody Loves Raymond, Thomas Cavanagh's Ed, and The Bonnie Hunt Show.
