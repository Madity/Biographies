David Blaine (born David Blaine White; April 4, 1973) is an American magician, illusionist and endurance artist. He is best known for his high-profile feats of endurance, and has made his name as a performer of street and close-up magic.[1] He has performed all over the world and has set and broken several world records.
Blaine was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Patrice Maureen White (1946–1995)[2] and William Perez. His father was a half Puerto Rican and half Italian veteran of the Vietnam War, and his mother was a school teacher of Russian Jewish descent.[3] When Blaine was four years old, he saw a magician performing magic in the subway. This sparked a lifelong interest for him.[4] He was raised by his single mother and attended many schools in Brooklyn. When he was 10 years old, his mother married John Bukalo and they moved to Little Falls, New Jersey,[5] where he attended Passaic Valley Regional High School.[6] When Blaine was 17 years old, he moved to Manhattan, New York.[7]
On May 19, 1997, Blaine's first television special, David Blaine: Street Magic aired on then NBC. According to the New York Daily News: "Blaine can lay claim to his own brand of wizardry. The magic he offers in tonight's show operates on an uncommonly personal level."[8] When asked about his performance style, David explained, “I'd like to bring magic back to the place it used to be 100 years ago.”'[9] Time magazine commented, "his deceptively low-key, ultracool manner leaves spectators more amazed than if he'd razzle-dazzled."[10] The concept of focusing on spectator reactions changed the way that magic has been shown on television. The New York Times wrote: "He's taken a craft that's been around for hundreds of years and done something unique and fresh with it."[9] Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller stated: "The biggest breakthrough done in our lifetime was David Blaine's Street Magic, where his idea was to do really simple tricks but to concentrate... to turn the camera around on the people watching instead of the people doing. So to make the audience watch the audience, which that first special Street Magic, is the best TV magic special ever done and really, really does break new ground." Many people watched the show.[11]
In Magic Man, Blaine is shown traveling across the country, entertaining unsuspecting pedestrians in Atlantic City, Compton, Dallas, the Mojave Desert, New York City, and San Francisco, recorded by a small crew with handheld cameras. Jon Racherbaumer commented: "Make no mistake about it, the focus of this show, boys and girls, is not Blaine. It is really about theatrical proxemics; about the show-within-a-show and the spontaneous, visceral reactions of people being astonished."[12] USA Today called Blaine the "hottest name in magic right now".[13]
On April 5, 1999, Blaine was entombed in an underground plastic box underneath a 3-ton water-filled tank for seven days across from Trump Place on 68th St. and Riverside Drive. According to CNN, "Blaine's only communication to the outside world was by a hand buzzer, which could have alerted an around-the-clock emergency crew standing by." BBC News reported that the cramped plastic coffin offered six inches (152 mm) of headroom and two inches on each side. During the endurance stunt Blaine ate nothing and drank only two to three tablespoons of water a day.[14] An estimated 75,000 people visited the site, including Marie Blood, Harry Houdini's niece, who said, "My uncle did some amazing things, but he could not have done this."[15] On the final day of the stunt, April 12, hundreds of news teams were stationed at the site for the coffin-opening. A team of construction workers removed a portion of the 75 cubic feet (2.1 m3) of gravel surrounding the six-foot-deep coffin before a crane lifted the water tank.[16] Blaine emerged and told the crowd, "I saw something very prophetic ... a vision of every race, every religion, every age group banding together, and that made all this worthwhile."[14] BBC News stated, "The 26-year-old magician has outdone his hero, Harry Houdini, who had planned a similar feat but died in 1926 before he could perform it."[17] During the preparation of the stunt, Jonathan Demme told Time Out New York, "He's the most exciting thing in America... and I'm not just talking entertainment."[18]
On November 27, 2000, Blaine began a stunt called "Frozen in Time," which was covered on a TV special. Blaine stood encased in a massive block of ice located in Times Square, New York City. He was lightly dressed and seen to be shivering even before the blocks of ice were sealed around him. A tube supplied him with air and water while his urine was removed with another tube. He was encased in the box of ice for 63 hours, 42 minutes and 15 seconds before being removed with chain saws. The ice was transparent and resting on an elevated platform to show that he was actually inside the ice the entire time. CNN confirmed that "thousands of people braved the pouring rain Wednesday night to catch a glimpse of Blaine as workers cut away at the ice."[19] He was removed from the ice in an obviously dazed and disoriented state, wrapped in blankets and taken to the hospital immediately because doctors feared he might be going into shock.[20] The New York Times reported, "The magician who emerged from the increasingly unstable ice box seemed a shadow of the confident, robust, shirtless fellow who entered two days before."[21] Blaine said in the documentary follow-up to this feat that it took a month before he was able to walk again and that he had no plans to ever again attempt a stunt of this difficulty.[22]
On May 22, 2002, a crane lifted Blaine onto a 100-foot (30 m) high and 22-inch (0.56 m) wide pillar in Bryant Park, New York City. He was not harnessed to the pillar, so there were two retractable handles on either side of him to grasp in the event of harsh weather.[23] The Evening Standard's James Langton wrote, "He was battered by high winds and unusually cold May weather during his first night and would have been killed or seriously injured if he had fallen."[24] He remained on the pillar for exactly 35 hours. The New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik wrote, “David Blaine, standing up there, is actually as good a magical metaphor for the moment as Houdini, fighting his way out of the straitjacket of immigrant identity toward prosperity, was for his."[25] With his legs weak from standing atop the pillar for so long, he ended the feat by jumping down onto a landing platform made out of a 12-foot (3.7 m) high pile of cardboard boxes and suffered a mild concussion.

On October 29, 2002, Random House published David Blaine's Mysterious Stranger: A Book of Magic.[26] Part autobiography, part history of magic, and part armchair treasure hunt, the book also includes instructions on how to perform card tricks and illusions. Editing director, Bruce Tracy, explains that “David Blaine is the most exciting and creative magician since Houdini, and now, readers have the opportunity to enjoy Blaine's unique book about magic, and they can participate by testing their own ability to discover and interpret clues.”[27]
The treasure hunt, Blaine's $100,000 Challenge, was devised by game designer Cliff Johnson, creator of The Fool's Errand, and solved by Sherri Skanes on March 20, 2004, 16 months after the book's publication.[28]
On September 5, 2003, Blaine began his 44-day endurance stunt sealed inside a transparent Plexiglas case suspended 9 metres (30 ft) in the air next to Potters Fields Park on the south bank of the River Thames, the area between City Hall and Tower Bridge in London. The case, measuring 3 feet (0.9 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), had a webcam installed so that viewers could observe his progress. During the 44-day period, Blaine went without any food or nutrients and survived on just 4.5 litres of water per day.
The endurance stunt became the subject of much media attention. The Guardian wrote, "Blaine has created one of the most eloquent and telling visual images of our time."[29] The Times reported that "1,614 articles in the British press have made reference to the exploit."[30] Then U.S. President George W. Bush referred to Blaine’s stunt in a speech at the Whitehall Palace in London, saying, “The last noted American to visit London stayed in a glass box dangling over the Thames. A few might have been happy to provide similar arrangements for me.”[31]
A number of spectators were mischievous or hostile towards the endurance artist. The Times reported that eggs, lemons, sausages, bacon, water bottles, beer cans, paint-filled balloons and golf balls had all been thrown at the box.[30] The Evening Standard reported that one man was arrested for attempting to cut the cable supplying water to Blaine's box.[32] According to BBC News, a hamburger was flown up to the box by a remote-controlled helicopter as a taunt.[33]
On September 25, BBC News reported that Blaine announced via webcam that he was feeling the taste of pear drops on his tongue.[34] A medical doctor, Adam Carey, performed an examination of Blaine before he entered the box and said that the taste was produced by ketones produced by the body burning fatty acids, which are themselves produced from fat reserves.
Blaine emerged on schedule on October 19, murmuring "I love you all!" and was quickly hospitalized. The New England Journal of Medicine published a paper that documented his 44 day fast and stated that his re-feeding was perhaps the most dangerous part of the stunt.[35] The study reported, “He lost 24.5 kg (25 percent of his original body weight), and his body mass index dropped from 29.0 to 21.6. His appearance and body-mass index after his fast would not by themselves have alerted us to the risks of refeeding. Despite cautious management, he had hypophosphatemia and fluid retention, important elements of the refeeding syndrome.”[36] The event was filmed by director, and close friend of Blaine, Harmony Korine.
David Blaine prepares to hold his breath on the final night of Drowned Alive at Lincoln Center, New York
On May 17, 2006, Blaine was submerged in an 8 feet (2.4 m) diameter, water-filled sphere (isotonic saline, 0.9% salt) in front of the Lincoln Center in New York City for a planned seven days and seven nights, using tubes for air and nutrition. During the stunt, doctors witnessed skin breakdown at the hands and feet. The New York Times' Kenneth Silverman wrote "his feat of endurance brought a diverse crowd of thousands of New Yorkers together, renewing for a while the city's waning spirit of democratic community."[37]
He concluded this event by attempting to hold his breath underwater to break the then-current world record of 8 minutes, 58 seconds held by Tom Sietas for static apnea—holding one's breath without the aid of breathing 100% oxygen beforehand,[38] although Blaine's attempt would not have qualified as static apnea under AIDA International rules.[39] Due to his producers' request to make the show more exciting, Blaine attempted to free himself from handcuffs and chains put on him upon coming out after the week in the sphere.[40] He seemed to have trouble escaping from the last of the handcuffs. Around the 7 minute mark, he showed some signs of distress. He was pulled up and out of the water by his support divers after 7 minutes and 12 seconds underwater—one minute and fifty seconds short of his goal.[41] Although he did not take home the record for breath holding, he was called “an everyday hero for an everyday age,” by The Boston Globe,[42] and The Washington Post stated, “Blaine represented an opportunity to see something unbelievable.”[43]
Blaine has since broken the record for holding one's breath using oxygen beforehand (as permitted by the Guinness Book of Records).[44]
Blaine underwent multiple short hospital visits after the stunt ended and has entered an agreement with doctors from Yale University to monitor him in order to study the human physiological reaction to prolonged submersion.[44] In an interview on The Howard Stern Show on Sirius satellite radio, Blaine spoke of the week-long fasting he did before the "drowning alive" stunt, to avoid having to be concerned with defecation.
On November 19, 2006, Blaine announced his next stunt: he would be shackled to a rotating gyroscope. His goal was to escape from his shackles after the gyroscope had been spinning for 16 hours. The gyroscope was constantly spinning at a rate of eight revolutions per minute while hanging above an empty lot in Manhattan near Times Square.
The stunt began on November 21, 2006, with Blaine declaring, "This one's exciting for me. This one's a fun one." 52 hours later, without food or water, a dehydrated and weakened Blaine landed on a wooden platform 30 feet (9.1 m) below after jumping from the hanging gyroscope.[45]
As a result of his success, Blaine led 100 children selected by The Salvation Army on a shopping spree at Target, after each child received a $500 gift certificate from the retailer. Blaine said the stunt was particularly important since The Salvation Army had provided him with clothing while he was growing up. "This challenge is close to my heart," Blaine said. Unlike many of his endurance stunts this one was never televised as a unique show.
After failing to surpass the then-current record of unassisted static apnea in his previous attempt Drowned Alive,[46][47] Blaine appeared on the April 30, 2008 episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, announcing that he would attempt to break the Guinness World Record for oxygen assisted static apnea set by Peter Colat of Switzerland on February 10, 2008.
Before entering his eighteen-hundred gallon water tank, Blaine spent 23 minutes inhaling pure oxygen; up to 30 minutes of "oxygen hyperventilation" is allowed under guidelines.[48] His heart rate remained above one hundred beats per minute during much of the attempt, rising to one hundred and twenty-four bpm in the fifteenth minute. This faster heart rate increases oxygen consumption leading to painful carbon dioxide buildup.[48] In the final minute, his heart rate became erratic and Blaine became worried he might blackout. In order to assist the medics in case he would lose consciousness, he unhooked his feet from the sphere's bottom and floated closer to the surface ;[48][49] however, he kept his head submerged for a half minute longer than the previous record. Ultimately, Blaine held his breath for 17 minutes 4½ seconds, surpassing Colat's previous mark of 16 minutes 32 seconds. This was Blaine's first Guinness record[49] and it stood for almost four and a half months, until surpassed by Tom Sietas on September 19, 2008.
During the following interview, Blaine stated: "I really thought I was not going to make it,"[49] claiming that he did so by staying in a meditative state which was helped by the studio lights reflecting off the sphere.[48] According to Blaine, besides the pressure of performing on television, the heart-rate monitor happened to be close enough to his ear so that he heard its beeping, and he had to keep his feet locked in holds at the bottom of the sphere — instead of just floating freely, as he did in the pool on Grand Cayman months earlier. Back then he said he was so relaxed he "wasn’t even there" during most of the breath-hold. But when he emerged from the sphere today, he told Oprah, "I was pretty much here the whole time."[49]
On September 18, 2008, Donald Trump and Blaine held a press conference at the Trump Tower in New York City to announce his latest feat, “The Upside Down Man”. Blaine was to hang upside down without a safety net for 60 hours above Central Park’s Wollman Rink, with a predicted end for 10:45 p.m. on September 24. Reportedly, Blaine risked blindness and other maladies in the stunt.[50] Trump has helped finance this and other Blaine events. Blaine hung over the Wollman Rink and interacted with fans by lowering himself upside down. At the press conference, Blaine stated he had already gone without food for over a week and would continue to do so throughout the act. In order to drink fluid and restore circulation, he would pull himself up, all the while contending with muscle spasms and lack of sleep. Blaine began the stunt on Monday September 22, but was widely criticized when, only hours into the endurance challenge, he was seen by fans to be standing on a waiting crane platform, and not upside down, as expected.[51] He reportedly would come down once an hour to receive a medical check, stretch and relieve himself.[52]
When the "Dive of Death" took place, Blaine came down from the platform on a cable, and lightly touched the stage. He was then pulled back up into the air, and, in the words of the Daily News (New York), "hung in the air like a sack of potatoes with a goofy grin on his face, occasionally kicking his legs as though he were running."[53] The plan had been for Blaine to be pulled up into the air by helium balloons and disappear into the atmosphere.[53] Blaine attributed the problem to changes in weather conditions that occurred after the stunt was delayed due to an address by President Bush.[53]
On June 17, 2011, Blaine announced on a live video chat that he would be doing a show in May 2012. During this video chat he also demonstrated a few of his new tricks, showed a video of him swimming with Great White Sharks[54] and announced his new card deck called the white lions. He stated that the show will be 100% street magic and full of completely new material. However, due to no real public enthusiasm for such a project he decided to perform an endurance stunt titled 'Electrified: One Million Volts Always On'.
David Blaine was the target for the electrical discharge produced by seven Tesla coils on Pier 54, New York City
On October 5, 2012, Blaine began performing a 72-hour endurance stunt called "Electrified: One Million Volts Always On" atop a 22-foot high pillar on Pier 54 in New York City, produced by Intel and Vice and livestreamed via YouTube.[55] ArcAttack built a system of seven Tesla coils producing an electric discharge of at least one million volts continuously for the duration. These seven Tesla coils were directed at Blaine for the entirety of the endurance stunt, during which he neither ate food nor slept. He wore 34 lbs of gear, including a chainmail Faraday suit. John Belcher, a physics professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reportedly said, “He has a conducting suit, all the current is going through the suit, nothing through his body. There is no danger in this that I see. I would do it, and I am 69 years old and risk-averse."[56] At night, Blaine was visibly shivering uncontrollably from the inclement weather. The Science Times of The New York Times published an article describing the science behind Blaine’s stunt and featured it on page one of nytimes.com.[57] A number of notables visited the event, including performance artist Marina Abramović, film director Darren Aronofsky,[58] comedian Chris Rock,[59] musician Pharrell Williams,[60] and rocker Andrew W.K.,[61] with the latter two musicians performing solos on a keyboard controlling the electric discharge.
At the conclusion of the event on October 8, 2012 at 8:44 PM, Blaine was weary, but was able to walk with assistance and kiss his fiance, Alizee Guinochet.[62] An ambulance transported him to a hospital for checkups.[63]
David Blaine donated two of the Tesla coils to the Liberty Science Center, in Jersey City, New Jersey to be exhibited on permanent display as part of a public learning experience.[64]
Blaine starred in a 90-minute ABC television special, "David Blaine: Real or Magic", on November 19, 2013.[65] The special was directed by Emmy Awarding winning director Matthew Akers and featured Blaine performing magic for his favorite celebrities and public figures including Woody Allen, Robert De Niro, George W. Bush, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Harrison Ford, Kanye West, Jamie Foxx, Ricky Gervais, Woody Harrelson, Stephen Hawking, Lenny Kravitz, Macklemore, Olivia Munn, Katy Perry, Michael Phelps, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jon Stewart, Psy, Emmy Rossum, Olivia Wilde, and Jason Sudeikis.
In "Real or Magic" David Blaine blurred the lines between reality and illusion and elicited a range of reactions from both celebrities and impromptu street crowds.[66] At one point Blaine's performance even caused Harrison Ford to say, "“Get the f— out of my house.”[67] Real or Magic aired from 9:30-11:00 PM, drew a 2.5 rating with the 18-49 age bracket, won its time slot, and posted the best numbers in the time slot for ABC's 2013 season.[68]
David Blaine performs for President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as well as President George W. Bush
Every year, David Blaine has traveled all across the country and the world to perform magic for children’s hospital wards, burn units and juvenile wards, including Spofford, Bridges, Horizon, and Crossroads. Blaine has spent time performing magic for Paul Newman and the children diagnosed with serious illnesses at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.
On Friday, January 15, 2010 at 9 A.M. David Blaine started performing "Magic for Haiti" in Times Square until Monday, January 18, 2010 at 9 A.M, performing for the course of 72 hours and raising nearly one hundred thousand dollars.[69]
David Blaine has traveled internationally performing magic privately for President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, President George W. Bush,[70] Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He has also performed magic for the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili, the President of Ukraine Victor Yanukovych, and the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. Additionally, David Blaine has performed for Lakshmi Mittal.
Blaine has performed for many other public and private entities, including Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Stephen Hawking, Woody Allen, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Muhammad Ali. Blaine has also performed magic alongside Michael Jackson.
Blaine first appeared on TED's list of the 20 most popular TED Talks in 2013.[71] In this talk he describes his journey toward holding his breath for over 17 minutes.[72]
Blaine has one half-brother. Blaine and his fiancée, Alizee Guinochet, have one daughter, Dessa, born on January 27, 2011.[73] At the time that Guinochet went into labor, there was a massive blizzard where they lived in New York. Due to the intense weather, no cars or taxis were on the road, so Blaine had to hail a snowplow, which transported the couple to the hospital.[74]

			Magician David Blaine is known for his over-the-top public spectacles. He has been buried alive, drowned alive, frozen in ice, and suspended five stories over Times Square in New York City. Learn more about this Brooklyn-born, NYC-bred magician.
			David Blaine was born on April 4, 1973 in Brooklyn, New York. He is of Puerto Rican and Jewish decent and grew up in New Jersey, attending Passaic Valley High School in Little Falls. Blaine first became interested in magic at age 4 after he saw a street magician perform card tricks. David’s mother Patrice White strongly encouraged his new interest.
			In his teens, Blaine caught the acting bug and frequently commuted from New Jersey into New York City to attend acting classes and auditions, managing to land some work in commercials and on the soaps.
			At age 20, Blaine learned that his mother had been stricken with ovarian cancer. She passed away in 1994, but Blaine is frequently quoted saying that she remains an important influence on his life.
			On his own, Blaine eventually settled in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan and continued to pursue his dream of becoming a famous magician.
			The ambitious Blaine made sure to attend celebrity functions and hobnob with the rich and famous. He performed tricks for the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and David Geffen. Word about his prowess as an illusionist soon began to spread.
			Early on, David Blaine made his name performing magic tricks on the street and filming his volunteers’ reactions. The most dazzling of his street tricks was his levitation illusion, in which he appeared to magically raise himself up to two feet above the ground.
			Hoping to drum up interest in his act, David sent a tape of his street performances to ABC. The response was encouraging to say the least. ABC gave Blaine a million dollar contract to produce David Blaine: Street Magic in 1997, which was followed by David Blaine: Magic Man in 1999.
Buried Alive -- On April 5, 1999, Blaine spent one week buried inside a glass coffin at Donald Trump’s Trump Place Development on the West Side of Manhattan. Except for an area at the top that was open to the viewing public, the coffin was completely covered with dirt.
Frozen in Time -- On November 27, 2000, Blaine was encased in ice for almost 62 hours in New York’s Times Square. A network of tubes provided him with air, water, and the ability to relieve himself.
Vertigo -- On May 22, 2002,Blaine spent over 34 hours on a pillar 90 feet high and 22 inches wide in New York’s Bryant Park. David sustained a concussion during the stunt when he dove into a large pile of cardboard boxes at the foot of the pillar.
Above the Below -- On September 5, 2003, Blaine spent 44 days sealed inside a transparent glass box suspended 30 feet above the ground in London’s Potter Fields Park on the bank of the River Thames. The glass box was approximately 7 feet x 7 feet x 3 feet. During the 44 days, Blaine claims to have fasted and lost 54 pounds of body weight.
Drowned Alive -- On May 1, 2006, Blaine spent one week immersed in an 8-foot transparent sphere filled with water at Lincoln Center in New York City. The sphere was filled with 2000 gallons of water at a temperature of 96 degrees. Upon completing the week-long endurance test, Blaine removed his breathing apparatus in an attempt to break a world record of almost nine minutes without breathing. Unfortunately, he only reached 7 minutes 8 seconds before needing to come out. To prepare for the stunt, Blaine claims to have dropped his weight by 50 pounds so that his body would require less oxygen.
Gyroscope -- On Tuesday November 20, 2006, Blaine will be suspended 40 feet in the air above Times Square while spinning 8 times per minute. The stunt will last through Thanksgiving Day as Blaine attempts to escape by 5AM on Friday, November 23rd, 2006.

The street is his stage, and his audience - anyone craving to be mystified. David can take any ordinary object, or borrow any personal belonging from a passerby, and whip up an unforgettable magical happening. His signature street illusion is the ability to defy the laws of gravity and levitate himself before baffled onlookers. David is also an endurance artist, and is best known for his high-profile feats of endurance, which have broken several world records. Interesting FactDavid Blaine held his breath for 17 minutes and 4.4 seconds to set the world record, according to  Guinness World Record's, surpassing Colat's previous mark of 16 minutes and 32 seconds. This was Blaine's first Guinness record.
David Blaine was born April 4, 1973 in Brooklyn New York. He was raised in New Jersey by his single mother Patrice Maureen White. She was a school teacher, however, she took on as many as three jobs just to provide for her and little David. At age four he saw a street magician perform in a subway; Blaine, fascinated with the magicians card tricks, decided to purchase his first trick, The Pencil Through the Card. David would practice magic with tarot cards given to him by his grandmother who was a gypsy. Since he did not have the money to go to a magic shop, he spent countless hours in libraries researching magic.   There he would read every book he could get his hands on and continued fiddling with his tarot cards.  At age five, he learned what his dream was; after showing a neighbor an effect with the tarot cards, he saw for the first time the impact magic can have emotionally on people.  He immediately told his mom he wanted to be a showman and she strongly encouraged him in everyway.In his teens, he began to develop an interest in acting.  He traveled to Manhattan everyday to attend acting school.  He did a few commercials and small appearances on soap operas.  At sixteen, Blaine levitated for his doctor who immediately took him in for examination.
 When David was 21, his mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of 48. It was then that he devoted his life to magic.In his early twenty's, David was your regular street magician who got gigs at rich parties. Because of his talent and mysterious persona, he was able to draw up connections to ABC. After seeing a tape of his magic, the producers requested an interview and began planning a special.His first TV special, "David Blaine: Street Magic" was born and marked the beginning of a new era in magic for television. The special was not about grand illusions and theatrical lighting, but rather intimate miracles being performed in the streets before real people - a concept that had never been done before on TV. The show was an instant success and David was an overnight celebrity.He has performed magic for many celebrities, such as Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mike Tyson and President Clinton. David has also made guest appearances on nearly every major talk show of that decade including Oprah, Conan O'Brien, Rosie, Carson Daily, and Howard Stern.  Even Comedy Central's SouthPark has an episode featuring him.
Influenced by his idol, Harry Houdini, David Blaine decided to became an endurance artist. His first stunt, getting buried alive for seven days, had the approval of Houdini's granddaughter. He did the stunt to promote his second special, "David Blaine: Magic Man". Since then, David has been frozen alive, immobilized while standing on a poll over a hundred feet from the ground, viewed hanging from a crane over the River Thames bridge in London and hanging upside down above New York's Central Park for 60 hours. Most of his stunts usually involve enduring long periods of time without food, drink or sleep. David continues to push the envelope with each stunt.

I want to make out with this show. I want chill with it, get to know it a little better, and then make like awkward eighth graders at summer camp. Seriously, what is it about this show that makes me laugh so much? Even my roommate, a fellow Reaper lover who sits self-shackled next to me on the couch every Tuesday night, throws me questioning stares because I chortle obnoxiously at the tube every 15 seconds. So yes, I'm a huge dork. And according to the CW's ratings breakdown, I'm also one of the total four women who watch this show. Yeah, take that... all other shows. Yeah.I think the show is really taking off. This time I found myself not so concerned for the vessel or what it would be, as much as how all the shenanigans were going to go down. Whereas I once watched with suspicion, I now watch for fun. And I think that says a lot about the leaps it's made. Sam is getting comfy with his hunting prowess, is accepting his fate, and is slowly growing a pair. That last one in particular...
The NBA will unveil a new on-air promotional campaign this weekend during playoff games. Dubbed Unbelievable, the series of spots features magician David Blaine humorously attempting to debunk the mind-boggling abilities of NBA stars. First up, starting Saturday, are spots with LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Yao Ming of the Houston Rockets which offer explanations for their skills at slam-dunking and shot-blocking, respectively.Coming next week are promos highlighting two-time league MVP Steve Nash (Phoenix Suns), Ben Gordon (Chicago Bulls), and Baron Davis, whose heroics just led the Golden State Warriors to a major first-round upset of the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks. Somewhere, an ad with Dirk Nowitzki must be collecting dust.
David Blaine is a total hack, especially compared to Criss Angel.

David BlaineMagicianBorn: 4 April 1973Birthplace: Brooklyn, New YorkBest known as: The stunt magician who was once buried alive in New York CityShowman David Blaine's original specialty was "street magic" -- close-up magic done for small groups on New York City streets. His talent was showcased in a series of national TV specials in the late 1990s, with dramatic gasps from bystanders caught on camera. Soon David Blaine was both a magician and a celebrity, known for his hipster style, uptown-casual clothes, and friendships with actors like actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Over time Blaine moved from small-scale stunts to much-publicized set pieces that were as much endurance tests as feats of legerdemain. David Blaine was buried in a glass coffin for a week in a 1999 New York City stunt, and the next year he spent three days encased in a block of ice in Times Square. He stood atop a 90-foot pillar in New York's Bryant Park for two days in 2002 before falling into a cushion of cardboard boxes. In 2003 he spent 44 days suspended in a glass box near the Thames River in London. He lounged in a water-filled glass sphere outside New York's Lincoln Center for a week in May of 2006 in a stunt he called "Drowned Alive," and in September 2008 he hung upside down in New York's Central Park for 60 hours in a feat called "Dive of Death." Among his other stunts is "Electrified," in which (as described by the New York Daily News) he stood "on a 20-foot-high (6-meter-high) platform at Pier 54 on Manhattan's West Side, within a Tesla coil apparatus that continually zapped him with artificial lightning bolts."Extra credit: At the end of "Drowned Alive," David Blaine tried but failed to set a world record for holding one's breath, while also attempting to escape from shackles at he bottom of his sphere. Divers pulled him from the water after seven minutes.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC. All rights reserved.More on David Blaine from Infoplease:

"(I want to bring magic) to a level where Houdini had it a hundred years ago. When you thought of magic, you were intrigued... you were emotionally moved by it. It had a meaning and a purpose." -David Blaine
                Blaine has generated an insane amount of celebrity based on the old Harry Houdini standard -- perform an incredible stunt and notify the press beforehand. In addition, his television specials broke the mold of typical magic performances. He is currently making headlines for his most recent stunt, which involves Blaine living in a box suspended by London's River Thames, and enduring starvation and solitary confinement for 44 days.            
                If he were more visible then perhaps the score would be higher. But for the love of God, the man was having sex with supermodel and uber-babe Josie Maran!  Maybe they are still sleeping together as you read this, as they are allegedly "still friends"!  What more could you ask for? If Blaine could land one of the most supreme and beautiful women on the planet, what would stop him from having whoever he wanted now?  Plus, with all of his purported magical powers, maybe he could cast spells over women.  Hey, maybe that explains Josie!            
                We had to give Blaine a lower score than we wanted to because the fact of the matter is that the man has not exploded onto the scene just yet.  He generated an amazing amount of buzz with David Blaine: Street Magic in 1997, and followed it up with another special two years later.  You might remember that he buried himself alive for seven days in order to promote 1999's David Blaine: Magic Man.  The publicity he has generated for his New York City stunts is considerable but to be honest, Blaine has to come on stronger than that on a regular basis to penetrate the collective mindset of mainstream America, let alone a global audience.  That will surely change with his most recent endurance stunt, which involves Blaine living in solitary confinement for 44 days -- with no food -- in a glass box suspended by the River Thames in London.  Unfortunately, Blaine is mostly attracting negative press, as passersby are harassing him during his stunt.            
                Born in Brooklyn, New York on April 4, 1973, David Blaine was inspired by his mother to dabble in magic.  Blaine began at the age of four when he witnessed a subway performer and then chose to try his first card trick routine.  As a teenager, Blaine began to pursue acting as a career and took regular trips into Manhattan from his then New Jersey home to attend classes.  He was fortunate enough to land some commercial spots and appearances on daytime dramas.  It was during this time that his ability to levitate off of the ground surfaced and at the urging of his personal physician, Blaine underwent a thorough examination.  career was ready to be lifted As a young adult, Blaine moved back to the city, to the notorious neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen.  His mother was stricken with cancer around the same time and passed away in 1994, when Blaine was just 21.  Yet the loss did not stifle his burning ambition to perform.  He began to make a name for himself at celebrity functions by doing magic tricks for famous people, such as Mike Tyson, Al Pacino and David Geffen.  Through a common contact, he struck a friendship with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio.  Blaine decided to take a chance and aspire to greater heights, so he made a tape of a performance and sent it to ABC.  The response was tremendous and an interview was requested soon after.  His first special was later produced, David Blaine: Street Magic and it became a ratings hit in 1997.  David Blaine: Magic Man followed two years later.  Blaine was soon in demand on the talk show circuit and appeared on just about every major show imaginable.  He was even rumored to be dating Madonna at one time. blaine buried alive In 1999, Blaine performed his most notable stunt to date, as he was submerged in 4000 pounds of water for over one week to promote his latest special.  The publicity was amazing and after he emerged 24 pounds lighter, he once again was seen plugging the show on the talk show circuit.  Another stunt involving a block of ice generated similar acclaim, as well as many cynics.  But even the recent rash of theories attempting to debunk the Blaine brand of magic has not diminished his fame.  In fact, the negative publicity has had the opposite effect, as movie and book deals have rolled in, and has proved to be a rallying point for his most fervent supporters.  Unfortunately for Blaine, there are more skeptics than supporters during his "Above The Below" stunt, which involves Blaine living in a glass box that is suspended by a crane by the River Thames in London, for 44 days, without food.
