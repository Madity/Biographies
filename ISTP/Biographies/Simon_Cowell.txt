This article is about the music executive.  For the author and television presenter, see Simon Cowell (presenter).
Simon Phillip Cowell (born 7 October 1959)[1] is an English television music and talent competition judge, A&R executive, television producer, entrepreneur, and television personality. He is known in the United Kingdom and United States for his role as a talent judge on TV shows such as Pop Idol, The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent and American Idol. He is also the owner of the television production and music publishing house Syco.
As a judge, Cowell is known for his blunt and often controversial criticisms, insults and wisecracks about contestants and their abilities. He is also known for combining activities in both the television and music industries, having promoted singles and records for various artists, including television personalities. He was most recently featured on the seventh series of Britain's Got Talent and the third season of The X Factor USA.
In 2004 and 2010, American magazine Time named Cowell one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[2][3] In 2010, British magazine New Statesman listed Cowell at number 41 in a list of "The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010".[4] TV Guide named him #10 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.[5]
Cowell was born in Lambeth, London, England,[6] and brought up in Elstree, Hertfordshire.[7] His mother, Julie Brett (née Josie Dalglish), is a former ballet dancer and socialite, and his father, Eric Selig Phillip Cowell, Sr. (1918–1999),[6] was an estate agent developer and music industry executive.[8] Cowell's father was from a mostly Jewish family, though he did not discuss his background with his children (Cowell's paternal grandmother had immigrated from Poland).[9] Cowell's mother was from a Christian background, and is of English descent.[9][10] He has a younger brother, Nicholas Cowell, three half-brothers, John, Tony, and Michael Cowell, and a half-sister, June Cowell.
Cowell attended Radlett Preparatory School and the independent Dover College as did his brother, but left after taking GCE O levels. He passed in English Language and Literature and then attended Windsor Technical College where he gained another GCE in Sociology.[11] At the age of 17, he dated model Paula Hamilton. Cowell took a few menial jobs—including, according to Tony, working as a runner on Stanley Kubrick's The Shining[12]—but did not get along well with colleagues and bosses, until his father, who was an executive at the recording giant EMI Music Publishing, managed to get him a job in the mail room.
Cowell was given the role of judge on the first series of Pop Idol in the UK by then ITV Controller of Entertainment Claudia Rosencrantz[13] in 2001, he was then judge on the first season of American Idol in 2002. With his notoriously critical reputation, Cowell is likened to TV personalities such as Judith Sheindlin and Anne Robinson. Though comparable to Robinson, Cowell has expressed his dislike for her and has commented in an interview, "I hate her and I hate her show because it's just an act".[14] Cowell's prominence grew, fed by his signature phrase, "I don't mean to be rude, but ...", inevitably followed by an unsparingly blunt appraisal of the contestant's talents, personality, or even physical appearance. A lot of these one-liners were the product of coaching that Cowell received from noted publicist Max Clifford (who was sacked by Cowell after being convicted of sex offences as a result of Operation Yewtree, the investigation into Jimmy Savile, as of May 2014).[15] Cowell also appeared on the one-off World Idol programme in 2003, where it became clear that each country's version of the Idol had attempted to come up with its own "Simon Cowell" type personality. In 2003, Cowell placed No 33 on Channel 4's list of the all-time 100 Worst Britons. Cowell's S Records signed the top two finishers of the first season of Pop Idol, Will Young and Gareth Gates, both of whom went on to have No 1 UK hits. Efforts begun in 2001 materialised in 2004, when Cowell returned to his group manufacturing roots with his latest brainchild, the internationally successful operatic pop group Il Divo,[16][17] consisting of three opera singers and one pop singer of four different nationalities. Inspired by the success of Il Divo, Simon created a child version, Angelis, beating competition from similar groups emerging at Christmas 2006.
On 11 January 2010, Cowell's exit from American Idol was made official. The 2010 season was Cowell's last on the show. It was also announced that FOX had acquired the rights to The X Factor USA, an American version of Cowell's British show, The X Factor, which began in September 2011.[18][19]
In 2004, with Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh, Cowell was a judge on the first series of the British television music competition The X Factor, which he created using his production company, Syco. The X Factor was an instant success with the viewers and enjoyed its tenth series in 2012.
One Direction signed to Cowell's record label after finishing third and being mentored by Cowell in 2010. The group are one of Cowell's international breakout acts.[20][21][22][23]
Leona Lewis, the winner of the third series of The X Factor, was signed to Cowell's label Syco and has had number one singles and album sales around the world.[24][25] Cowell returned for a fourth series on 18 August 2007 alongside Osbourne, Walsh and new judge, Dannii Minogue. Walsh had previously been sacked from the judging panel by Cowell for the fourth series, and was subsequently replaced by Brian Friedman, who was a judge on Grease Is the Word. Walsh was later brought back a week into the auditions by Cowell when he and Osbourne realised that they missed Walsh and that without him, there was no chemistry between the judges. Cowell returned for the fifth series in 2008, with Walsh, Minogue and new judge Cheryl Cole, as Osbourne decided to quit before the show began.[26][27] Cowell returned for series 6 and 7 as well, although series 7 was to be his last, as he left in 2011 in order to launch The X Factor in America. After placing third in the seventh series of The X Factor in the UK, boyband One Direction signed to Cowell's label in 2011, and the group have gone on to top singles and album charts worldwide.[28][29] He was replaced by Gary Barlow in series 8.
The X Factor Australia launched in 2005 and it featured Mark Holden, Kate Ceberano and John Reid, but was cancelled due to poor ratings. However, the show returned in 2010.
Cowell also launched The X Factor USA in September 2011 on American broadcaster Fox. It was originally announced that he would be a judge both on the UK and U.S. editions of the show, which air at similar times of the year,[30][31] but MTV officially reported on 17 April 2011 that this was not true; Cowell is no longer a judge in the UK version,[32] but instead will be an enormous presence backstage.[33] He was joined by Paula Abdul, L.A. Reid, Nicole Scherzinger and formerly Cheryl Cole. Cowell's act Melanie Amaro won the season, making Cowell the winning judge. Cowell and Reid returned for season 2, while Demi Lovato and Britney Spears joined the judging panel as replacements for Abdul and Scherzinger.
Cowell returned for a third and final season of The X Factor in September 2013 alongside Demi Lovato, while Britney Spears and L.A. Reid announced they would not be returning and were replaced by Kelly Rowland and Paulina Rubio. Cowell's last act Alex & Sierra won the season, marking Cowell's second season as the winning mentor after he won with Melanie Amaro in 2011.
In October 2013, it was reported that Cowell would maybe return to the UK version of The X Factor for series 11 as Gary Barlow's replacement.[34] On 7 February 2014, it was officially confirmed that Cowell would return to the UK version of The X Factor.[35] This resulted in the cancellation of the US version after three seasons by Fox. He will join Louis Walsh and Cheryl Cole.
In October 2010, Cowell signed a new three-year deals with ITV for both Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor, renewing both shows until 2013.[36] On 15 November 2013, the three-year deal was extended by a further three years, keeping it on air until 2016.[37]
Following the success of the Idol and X Factor franchises, Cowell, his company Syco, and its business partners developed a talent show format open to performers of any kind, not only singers, but also dancers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians, novelty acts, and so on. The origins of the Got Talent format can be traced to the British show Opportunity Knocks.
Cowell is the executive producer of America's Got Talent,[38] which debuted in June 2006, along with Fremantle producers of the Idol series, but he does not appear on the show due to the terms of his contract with Fox. The show was a huge success for NBC, drawing around 12 million viewers a week, and beating So You Think You Can Dance on Fox (produced by rival and Idol creator Simon Fuller).
Britain's Got Talent[39] debuted on ITV in June 2007. Cowell appears as a judge alongside Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan. The show was a ratings success and second and third seasons followed in 2008 and 2009. The third series featured a publicity coup when Susan Boyle[39][40] made a global media impact with her regional audition performance comparable to that of any previous talent show series winner.
On 16 March 2006, Simon Cowell's next competition show, American Inventor,[41][42] debuted on ABC. Fledgling entrepreneurs from across the United States competed to see who could come up with the best new product concept. The 2006 winner, Janusz Liberkowski,[43][44] received $1 million and the opportunity to develop his idea into a business. The show returned one more time in 2007 for a second season.
In 2006, Cowell executive-produced Celebrity Duets,[45] which was described as "an Idol show for Hollywood superstars." The show was hosted by Wayne Brady, and its judges were Marie Osmond, Little Richard[46] and David Foster.
Cowell was also the executive producer of Grease Is the Word for ITV. This show set out to find performers to play Danny and Sandy in the 2007 West End revival of Grease. It was hosted by Zoë Ball and judged by Britons David Ian and Sinitta and Americans David Gest and Brian Friedman. The musical theatre casting concept had already been introduced by the BBC with the ratings hit How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?, but Cowell's show was not the hoped for success. He himself said, "It has been slaughtered by the critics – and rightly so. It is far too similar to our other formats."[47]
Cowell collaborated with UK production company Shed Media to produce 2008 ITV drama series Rock Rivals, which is based on an X Factor type show.
In 2011, Cowell also created his first game show, titled Red or Black? and hosted by Ant & Dec, for ITV. Series 1 was broadcast over seven nights in one week (excluding Tuesday), from 3 to 10 September. The show has been recommissioned by ITV for a second series in 2012, which will be aired weekly.
In 2013 Cowell, in partnership with YouTube, launched a video-sharing competition called The You Generation.
In 2013, Simon was executive producer for ITV cookery series Food Glorious Food, which was hosted by Carol Vorderman. He will do the same for an upcoming game show called Keep it in the Family, presented by Bradley Walsh.
Cowell has been involved in charity work for many years.[48] He supports children from The Association Of Children's Hospices and invites them backstage to the screenings of The X Factor.[49] When he can, he stops by some of the hospices to visit the children.[49] He also supports animal rights and has appeared in a video for PETA in which he reminds drivers of the cruelty to animals that can occur when their pets are locked in cars in the summer.[50][51] In view of his charitable works, particularly the production of the charity single Everybody Hurts in aid of victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, as well as his services to the music industry, there was considerable media speculation as to whether Cowell would receive a knighthood in the Queen's 2010 Birthday Honours, a proposal allegedly put forward by former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.[52] Cowell stated that he believed his chances of receiving the honour were "zero" following what he described as being a "royal row"; ultimately Cowell did not receive an honour in the list.
In December 2003, Cowell published his autobiography titled I Don't Mean to be Rude, but.... In it, he told the whole story of his childhood, his years working in music and experiences on Pop Idol, Pop Stars Rivals, and American Idol, and finally, his tips for being successful as a pop star.
Cowell has appeared as a guest voice in an episode of The Simpsons ("Smart and Smarter"), in which he gets beaten up by Homer Simpson (while criticising Homer's punches).[53][54] His voice was also heard on an episode of Family Guy ("Lois Kills Stewie"), in which he told Stewie that his singing was so awful that he should be dead.[55][56][57] He made an MTV Movie Award-winning cameo appearance as himself in Scary Movie 3, where he sits in judgment during a battle rap (and is subsequently killed by gunfire for criticising the rappers). He also appears in the DVD version of Shrek 2 as a judge in Far Far Away Idol, and also provided the voice.[58]
He appeared on an episode of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? (the original British version) and Saturday Night Live in 2004. Cowell has also guest-starred (filling in for Regis Philbin) in the popular talk show Live with Regis and Kelly during American Idol's finalist week in early 2006. Cowell was once the fastest "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" on BBC's motoring show Top Gear, driving a Suzuki Liana around the show's test track in a time of 1:47.1. When Top Gear retired the Liana along with its rankings after the eighth series, Cowell was the eighth fastest overall and the third fastest non-professional driver. On 11 November 2007 Cowell yet again appeared on Top Gear, achieving a time of 1:45.9 thus putting him ahead of Gordon Ramsay and back at the top of the table.[59] Cowell introduced entertainer Dick Clark at the 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards. He was seen on Comic Relief Does The Apprentice where he donated £25,000 for a fun fair ticket. Cowell has also appeared on the MTV shows Cribs and Punk'd. On Punk'd, Ryan Seacrest and Randy Jackson set him up to believe his $400,000 Rolls Royce was stolen and had caused an accident by using a nearly identical car.[60]
Cowell was chosen as the first subject of the re-launched This Is Your Life in an episode broadcast on 2 June 2007. He was presented with the Red Book by Sir Trevor McDonald while presenting American Idol. On 1 July 2007 Cowell appeared alongside Randy Jackson and Ryan Seacrest as a speaker at the Concert For Diana, held at Wembley Stadium, London.[61] Cowell was a partner in the Royal Ascot Racing Club, a thoroughbred horse racing syndicate which owned the 2005 Epsom Derby winner, Motivator.[62]
In May 2010, he portrayed himself again, in another episode of The Simpsons, "Judge Me Tender".[63] In December 2010, he was added as a new entry to the latest edition of Who's Who.[64]
At the 2012 Pride of Britain Awards on 30 October, Cowell, along with Michael Caine, Elton John, Richard Branson and Stephen Fry, recited Rudyard Kipling's poem If— in tribute to the 2012 British Olympic and Paralympics heroes.
In July 2013, Andrew Silverman filed for an at-fault divorce in New York, citing adultery by his wife and naming Cowell as a co-respondent.[65] News of the divorce filing became public two weeks later, when it was widely reported that Lauren Silverman and Cowell were expecting a baby.[66] The child would be Cowell's first, but the second for Silverman, who has a son with Andrew Silverman.[67] When questioned by reporters, Cowell said, "There are a lot of things I will eventually clear up when the time is right, but I really have to be sensitive because there's a lot of people's feelings involved here," while the Silvermans released separate statements expressing concern for the well-being of their son during the divorce process.[68] In August 2013, the Silvermans settled their divorce out-of-court, allowing Cowell to avoid being called as a witness in the divorce proceedings.[69] Cowell subsequently confirmed that Silverman was pregnant with his child, and she gave birth to a boy called Eric on 14 February 2014.[70][71]
Cowell was estimated to have a fortune of £200 million in the Sunday Times Rich List of 2011, making him the sixth richest person in the British music industry.[72] Cowell splits his time between homes in London and Los Angeles.

1966Getting the BootAt 17, Cowell is booted out of a series of schools due to bad behavior, and eventually drops out. "The two things I hated about school were the discipline and boredom...I just had this sneaking suspicion that learning about Newton's theory wasn't actually going to play a huge part in my future," Cowell writes in his 2003 memoir, I Don't Mean to be Rude, But... "I think it's fair to say that I was the world's worst teenager." 1979The Ground FloorCowell has interests in film, music and television, and sabotages a list of interviews for "boring" jobs (law clerk, supermarket manager trainee, building surveyor) set up by his real estate executive father Eric. However, Cowell eventually lands a job that suits his interests, working as a runner for producers at Elstree Studios. After turning down an offer to work on the set of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Cowell takes a gig in the mailroom of EMI Music Publishing, where his father manages the property division. "From my first day on the job I began planning and scheming my way to the top of the business," Cowell writes in his memoir. 1985An ImpresarioAfter years of moving up the music-industry ladder to become a producer and A&R (artist and repertoire) man, Cowell strikes out on his own by setting up Fanfare Records. He signs his then-girlfriend Sinitta and scores the smash hits "So Macho" and "Toyboy." He also releases the Power Rangers theme single, and later fails to land the Spice Girls.1989Starting OverFanfare folds and Cowell is forced to move back in with his parents. He will later tell BusinessWeek that it was "the best thing that happened in my life, because I learned the value of money." The motivated businessman soon joins BMG as an A&R consultant. 
2001October 05Pop Goes SimonMusic impresario Simon Fuller creates a talent show called Pop Idol for British TV and has Cowell (along with three others) judge the abilities of contestants who hope to sing their way to stardom. Cowell's brutal honesty makes its first television appearance. "Let me throw a mathematical dilemma at you," he tells a contestant, "there's 500 left. Well, how come the odds of you winning are a million to one?" 
2002June 11An Idol is BornAmerican Idol, the transplanted Pop Idol brainchild of Fuller, debuts on Fox. Instantly the talent show becomes a cultural phenomenon. Cowel, who judges contestants with Paula Abdul and music vet Randy Jackson, emerges as the icon of brutal honesty. "You have invented a new form of torture," he tells one hopeful. In September, Kelly Clarkson is crowned the winner, beating Justin Guarini with 58 percent of the viewers' call-in vote.2003November 07Scary SimonCowell spoofs his tell-it-like-it-is American Idol persona in Scary Movie 3 as a judge in an 8 Mile-type rap challenge.

He also presents his tips for being a successful pop star. Entertainment Weekly recommends the book for "Idol addicts, [who] will revel in his relentless mockery of fellow judge Paula Abdul and blunt assessments of past contestants."
DecemberFour PlayAfter a two-year search, Cowell finds the right combination for a quartet he develops for the Sony label. Il Divo is comprised of American tenor David Miller, French vocalist Sebastien Izambard, Swiss tenor Urs Buhler and Spanish baritone Carlos Marin. The pop-opera singing group goes on to release a self-titled debut CD in April 2005 and will later tour with Barbra Streisand. 2004February 22D'oh! Simon in SpringfieldSelf-parody seems to be growing on Cowell, who satirizes his nasty Idol persona on an episode of The Simpsons. An animated Cowell judges applicants for an exclusive pre-nursery school and finds himself pummeled by Homer Simpson. "It's the best thing I've ever been asked to do," he tells the Daily Record.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Simon was born in London, England. His parents' names are Julie Cowell and Eric Cowell. Cowell started his career in the music industry working in the mailroom at EMI Music Publishing. He worked as a record producer, talent scout and consultant within the music industry before producing the hit British TV show Pop Idol and its U.S. counterpart, American Idol. Cowell's scathing comments were famous during his 10 seasons as a judge on American Idol. He started judging The X Factor in 2011.
      Has 3 half-brothers, John, Michael and Tony Cowell, a half sister, former child actress June Cowell, a biological sister, Lindsay Elizabeth and a younger brother Nicholas Cowell.
      Says that the first time he gave a criticism was at age four when he looked at his mother's white fuzzy pillbox hat and remarked "Mum, you look like a poodle" [Source: His book "I Don't Mean to Be Rude, But..."]
      During auditions for The X Factor (2004), he made a bet with auditionee Paul Holt that he would pay him £50,000 if he got a #1 single. Holt was quickly signed by a record label - and backed by The X Factor (2004) judge Sharon Osbourne - to release "50 Grand for Christmas" in December 2004, which only charted at #35 in the UK.
      He has 2 nieces and a nephew, namely: Tanyette Chantel (born October 18, 1981), Melissa Lee (born July 10, 1984), and Joshua Aaron, (born April 15, 1986) all 3 of whom have appeared in the audience during various episodes of Pop Idol Season 1.
      During an auditioning, a female participant told Simon and the other judges that she quit her job at a hair salon so she can pursue her dreams on American Idol; when getting rejected, Simon had asked for the phone and called the owner of the participant workplace where the rejected contestant got her job back.
      Made his screen debut in 1990, on the UK TV series Sale of the Century (1989), his prize for winning - Kitchen Utensils.
      His father Eric Cowell was a record company executive with EMI. He died at home in 1999 of a massive heart attack on the very day that Simon got his first Number One with a then-unknown band called Westlife who his dad had predicted would become big.
      In 2007, he earned an estimated $72 million in income from his various projects. $45 million from American Idol: The Search for a Superstar (2002), $15 million from Britain's Got Talent (2007) and The X Factor (2004), and $12 million from his record label.
      (May 10, 2010) Merited a place in Time magazine's - The 100 Most Influential People in the World ("Artists" category) - with a tribute provided by Nick Cannon.
      A TV commercial proposal was made to him by his agent who told him that he would be paid $1m for a day's work (the good news). When Cowell asked about the bad news, he was informed that the commercial was for "Viagra". Cowell reneged (interview: Piers Morgan Tonight: Episode dated 5 April 2011 (2011)).
      Has said he finds Britney Spears to be fascinating and wants her to be a part of The X Factor (2011).
Stanley Kubrick was his neighbour growing up. He pestered Eric Cowell, Simon's father, to sell his property to him.
      Turned down the chance to manage Take That, which went on to become one of the major boy bands of the 1990s.
Susan Boyle's star-making audition was one of Cowell's favourite moments on Britain's Got Talent (2009).
      When living in Elstree as a boy, Cowell rubbed shoulders with Roger Moore, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Bette Davis and Maureen O'Hara. He even sat on Davis' knee while she learned her lines. Moore used to invite the Cowell's to see recording of The Saint (1962).
      Before becoming famous, Cowell held down several brief jobs; quantity surveyor, a job at Tesco (he never made it past the interview), trainee law clerk, a runner, a waiter, a job in the EMI mailroom, and an estate agency where he had his worst job ever as a canvasser.
      Became a father for the 1st time at age 54 when his girlfriend Lauren Silverman gave birth to their son Eric Cowell on February 14, 2014.
      I'd accept an honour but I don't think I'm likely to get one. The Queen once described me as a dreadful man
      To a Pop Idol (2001) contestant: "Let me throw a mathematical dilemma at you - there's 500 left, well how come the odds of you winning are a million to one?".
      [Asked if he feels guilty about what he says to the American Idol contestants] "No, what I am doing is kind by telling people who are useless 'Do something that you're good at'. So I would only feel guilt if I misled somebody who was terrible."
      We've done three seasons of American Idol and by now it is safe to assume that most people know that you have to be able to sing. But people turn up who can't sing a note and yet they believe they are the Second Coming.
      Sit in these auditions for three weeks and hear "I Believe I Can Fly out of tune for the millionth time, YOU try and be nice
      If you would have asked me what I thought of America before I came over here I would have used the word 'corny'. And then you come over here and you find that it's not corny at all. British people are very cynical, they cannot bear someone else's success. Americans embrace other people's success. Everything in America is larger than life.
      [To the infamous Keith who sang a horrible rendering of 'Like a Virgin'] "Keith, last year I described someone as being the worst singer in America. I think you're possibly the worst singer in the world ... I've never, ever heard anything like that in my life, ever."
      They [Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson] loved him. I couldn't stand him [Taylor Hicks]. I didn't get it. At the end of the day you have to find a bona fide recording artist. Just because you win the show doesn't mean you will sell a lot of records. Chris Daughtry is the one who sold the albums, not Taylor.
      [About the day of his father's death and Westlife at number one]: The ultimate irony. The worst thing that could happen, and the best - all in the one day. It just shocked me to the core. I just never thought my dad wouldn't be around. I phoned him to tell him about the Number One, because that's what I did. When something good happened, I called my dad. At first, my mother couldn't even tell me he was dead. She just listened to me burbling on. Then she called me back to tell me. Awful.
      Music videos have become the equivalent of moving wallpaper. You notice them, but you can't remember them.
      If I went to a psychiatrist, it would be a long session. I've always thought that I do have a number of issues that probably need dealing with, because I am quite odd in some ways. I get very dark moods for no reason. Nothing in particular brings it on. You can be having the best time of your life and yet you're utterly and totally miserable. I get very antisocial, depressed and irritable with people. I don't have time for them. I can't make phone calls and stuff. I just sit on my own for days. I'm not sitting in a darkened room rocking. Things might have gone really well and then I torture myself. I cannot believe it. I have to find something to make me miserable. Someone said to me recently: 'You're like a human buffet table. Everyone comes and takes something from you and, at the end, there's nothing left'. The last time I felt that way was when I looked at my diary and realised I had the next 18 months planned. I could tell you where I was going to be every day - which city, what time and almost what I was going to eat. That really depressed me.
      [on plastic surgery] I think you've got to be very careful as a guy, in particular, that you can end up looking really, really weird.
      [on Botox] Of course I have had it. I mean, for me, it's like cleaning my teeth, you know? Something makes your teeth whiter or something stops you having lines.
      [About Cheryl Cole]: The hardest thing to accept is that everyone has painted me as a monster because I embarrassed her. But the truth was I was protecting her. I just want people to be in the best place at the right time. It wasn't that she was terrible. She was good. I just thought she'd be happier in the UK.
      I have an absolute hatred of losing. Even losing at Monopoly as a kid. I just want to beat the competition.
      We'll speak about general matters for the first five minutes and the rest of the time we'll speak about me.
      [money] If it could pour on me every day like a shower, I would lie in it for an hour. I just love it.
      [thinking back on Susan Boyle's star-making audition] I felt the audience getting restless, smelling blood even. And that changed after the singing. After the chorus, her life had changed forever. That was a magical audition, like no one else's.
      Was Susan Boyle right to dream a dream? Yes. Susan Boyle was good for all of us. She was certainly good for me because I look at me in that audition and saw something I didn't like, which was incredibly judgmental. Susan will help an awful lot of people who didn't have the confidence to do this.
      People need an escape and this is what I provide - an excuse to laugh and forget your problems. We change people's lives.
      [after hearing Susan Boyle's performance of I Dreamed a Dream on Britain's Got Talent 2009] Susan, you are a little tiger, aren't you?
      [Cowell's first thought when he laid eyes on Susan Boyle] This will take five seconds and then I can go have a cup of tea.
      [Britain's Got Talent] It gives the underdog a shot, and I think it's brilliant. The great thing about it is when you start seeing it in places like China and Afghanistan. It's democracy. We've given democracy back to the world.
      Susan (Boyle) could become the biggest star I've ever discovered. Susan is the biggest entertainment story this year (2009). Its the biggest phenomenon I've ever seen out of any of my shows (Britain's Got Talent). Broadway and Hollywood are possibilities for Susan. I would love to sit her down for five minutes and say "Susan, you proved a point. You turned us around in five seconds, I apologize for ever doubting you". She is one of the most famous people in the world. If nothing else happens she has acceptance and for whatever reason, I don't think she had that before.
      We've never had a runner-up like Susan (Boyle) before. She won over a lot of fans with her voice and graciousness.
      [on Piers Morgan] He is sensitive to criticism, much more so than I am. This is the sort of person who will Google himself twenty times a day to find something positive.
      [Los Angeles] It's a very difficult place to try and make it from the bottom up. It only works if you're dealing from a position of strength.
      [Westlife went to No 1 and his father died at the same time] The best day of my life had suddenly become the worst day of my life.
      Nothing is more demoralizing than a bad set of contestants. And nothing is more invigorating than seeing a real talent emerge.
      Never over-negotiate your initial salaries. If things work out afterwards, the money will follow. Ask for too much at the beginning and you may not get the job.
      I'm often asked if I can take criticism, and I always think back to those days when the tough feedback of someone who knew more than me helped me so much more than fake praise.
      My favourite contestant is the one who tells us I've given up everything for this. I've sacrificed a lot to live this dream. How old are you I ask? 17 they reply. In other words, this is an accurate representation of life today. Make me famous. Make me rich. I want it all. Now!
      [his reply when people ask him what they need to do to break into the music industry] Don't bother.
      Many celebs make the fatal mistake of reading their press, absorbing it and changing their ideas about themselves on the basis of what fans and critics say about them, e.g. Michael Jackson.
      'Jennifer Lopez' embodies the pop dream. Her rags to riches story proves that anyone can do great things with hard work, talent and a little luck.
      I'm as competitive with somebody who works for my company as I am with somebody who works for another label.
      The disco era was one of the best times for pop music - ever. It was an era that encouraged fun, glamour and excess.
      As a judge of talent, Pete Waterman is one of the best, because he's not sitting there as a record producer. He's sitting there as a true lover of music and talent - a fan. Pete is TV gold.
      If the public don't warm to your personality, you're out. The music industry requires that you have a larger-than-life personality.
      One minute, you're driving the 8:15 from Crewe to London, and three months later, you're on stage in front of millions of people.
      No matter how bad things are, if you've got the guts and the determination, you can fulfill your dream.
      First impressions count in this business. Even if you have a voice like Barbra Streisand, you won't get very far if you're ordinary.
      In her day, Madonna was one of the most innovative artists in the world. She had that instinct to know what producers to work with, and how and when to reinvent herself. She is a legend, but now she's a mother and a wife, she's respectable.
      The world I was born into was very different from the way the world is now. No McDonalds, no colour TV, and luckily, no Paula Abdul.
      Elvis and his management team were the first to recognize the power of television as the most powerful method of selling millions of records.
      [at 4 years of age] I may not have been able to read, but I knew precisely what music I didn't like - and my parents had a sizable collection of it.
      90% of the people are awful and 10% are good. Since 100% of the contestants believe they're destined to be big stars, 90% are deluded. Its an epidemic.
      [what it takes to win] We need someone who has the potential to be a star around the globe. Someone who is focused, talented, and a hard worker in every respect. You know when you're in the presence of a star.
      As a record executive based in England, I was trained to think of America as the ultimate market.
      As far as kids are concerned, I'm brilliant with them, as long as they belong to other people and I don't have to be with them 24 hours a day.
      The people on the bottom rung look up to those at the top, and the ones at the top invariably look down on those at the bottom.
      [the music business] The real sexy job in this business was to work for a record label. This was a business you had to teach yourself, and if you were going to succeed, you have to take risks.
      The Sex Pistols' appearance on The Bill Grundy Show was the most cynical, brilliant piece of TV I've ever seen.
      I am a very good judge. We look for those with the greatest potential; the singers and performers who could be molded and encouraged.
      [early auditions] I was sure the audience would respond to that, because it showcased what's inherently funny about the industry - the egos, the delusions, the tantrums, and of course, the singers who were horrendous but believed they were the Second Coming.
      [Lionel Ritchie] He had a fantastic sense of humour, was as smart as a whip and was as musically astute as anyone I had ever met.
      We now live in a fame epidemic. There has never been another time when so many young people sought celebrity status. Every magazine available portrays a lifestyle that looks great. My job is to point out to all the hopefuls the reality of what they're after. If you want that lifestyle you have to have talent. And you have to realize you may have to work for it.
      On the first day of any show you are conscious of the lights and cameras and the fact that you are on TV. By the second day, after listening to 160 wannabes who can't sing quite in time, you don't care. You just want them to leave the room.
      A bad singer who believes in himself has a different look in his eyes from that of a bad singer who comes in to make a mockery of the audition process. The latter has a funny little smile, or a weird kind of bravado.
      Having worked in the music business for 35 years, its probably the funniest business on Earth. When I watch Top of the Pops now, I don't find anything funny in it anymore. Our main job is to make an entertaining TV show, which honestly reflects the pop music industry. If we ever get it totally right though, no one will watch.
      It helps if you can write your own songs if you want to be a singer. If you can't its all the more harder.
      I tend to think its the song that's more powerful than the performer. Its a catch 22 situation: without the hit songs, artists don't have careers, but without careers, they won't have access to the hit songs.
      New artists need to be smart about their careers and take the path of lesser resistance when first establishing their names.
      There's a myth in this business that if you don't hit by the time you're 25, you'll never make it. No one is governed by age.
      I love anyone who can reinvent themselves. You can reinvent yourself not just through image, but through great pop songs.
      When you meet Elton John, you're meeting a star with a capital S. He is what pop music is all about.
      Someone with experience in the music business might be able to see something in you that you don't see in yourself.
      Many stars fall from their perch so rapidly they lose their dignity along with their reputation.
      Writing a hit song is one of the hardest jobs on Earth. If you can find an artist who is a gifted songwriter - hallelujah! They're as rare as the Loch Ness Monster. Take a picture to prove they exist.
      The artists who endure are the ones who stay focused even after they have reached the top of their profession. In this business, there's always someone younger and hungrier coming up behind you. Staying famous is by no means guaranteed.
      Being No 1 in the charts used to mean something. The pop charts have lost the plot that made them so exciting to watch.
      Artists are so perfectly handled and manicured that they don't have anything to say except careerist babble. I don't see any personalities anymore.
      If I was 17 and a glamour model knocked on my bedroom door, I'd have definitely invited her in.
      Barbra Streisand can be out of the news for five years, but if she announced tomorrow that she was holding a concert, it would sell out faster than any concert on Earth. She's like a film star from the 40s - she lives in the mansion on the hill, the public knows little about her private life, but she's not plastered all over the tabloids everyday. She's not like Madonna, who gives it all away in each incarnation and then has to remake herself to replenish her mystique. Barbra Streisand keeps her distance, is a little cooler, but no less respected.
      Justin Timberlake is a force to be reckoned with. He understood the point of springboard appeal. He evolved into a fully-fledged star.
      Entertainers do not rise to the top of they're craft, or even the middle without determination. Determination is an overused word, and the idea has become something of a cliché, but it's vital and true. Madonna's determination and confidence turned her into a pop star; her idea of herself as superior that separated her from the rest of the pack.
      A recording artist is probably the best job anyone could hope to have. The business is unpredictable and ruthless, but the rewards are huge. And it could be you, if you can sing.
      When rubbish stories are printed by the press, the public begins to believe them and the damage is done.
      The future of the music business depends on how quickly we adapt to things going wrong. If sales are down we're not giving the public what it wants.
      More PR people are spinning stories to cover failure than actually doing the song they're supposed to do.
      I preferred the time when the pop market was less crowded but had bigger stars. When acts like Bros, Take That and the Spice Girls made it big, they were out on their own and it was a far more exciting time.
      I really can't think of anybody who I've dated who I hate or who hates me. Just because a woman isn't your girlfriend, that doesn't mean she can't stay in your life.
      An entertainment career requires ridiculous amounts of hard work and difficult sacrifices. But the rewards, if you're lucky enough to enjoy them, are also huge, but getting there is almost impossible.
      I couldn't care less if people think I'm gay because it's nothing to be ashamed of. If I was living 200 years ago in a coal mine, maybe, but I work in possibly the gayest industry in the world! Music and TV! It would make no difference to my life or my career.
      I work out three or four times a week, I have Botox, take tons of vitamins and vitamin infusions - if you believe that these things work, you will feel better.
=======================================================
                Simon was brought up in Elstree, Hertfordshire by his parents, Eric and Julie Cowell.In addition to his younger brother Nicholas, Simon has three half-brothers; Michael, John, and Tony, and a half-sister, June. Cowell dropped out of school at 15 and after a few unsuccessful jobs his father, an executive at recording giant EMI Music Publishing, got him a job in the mail room. His connections eventually got him rehired as the assistant to an A&R man. From there, he worked his way up to record producer. However it wasn't long before he left the company to set up his own label, Fanfare, with partner Iain Burton. In 1989, Fanfare's mother company folded, driving the business into bankruptcy, forcing Cowell, deeply in debt, to move back in with his parents. Proving that he had an ear for a hit, BMG quickly offered Simon the position of A&R Consultant. His time at BMG saw him pioneer some of the biggest selling hits in the industry, including bands 'Five' and 'Westlife'. He can also be credited with the emergence of TV hits from the likes of cartoon puppets 'Zig & Zag', 'The Teletubbies' and 'Robson & Jerome'. Not only has Simon made records, he also breaks them: over a ten year period, via his company ‘S Records’, he has achieved sales of over 25 million albums, over 70 top 30 records, and 17 Number 1 singles. His band 'Westlife' has achieved an impressive 10 Number 1 hits alone. Following the success of the 'Popstars' TV series, Simon joined forces with Simon Fuller to produce a ‘talent’ show where the public decides who wins. This show became the TV phenomenon, ‘Pop Idol’. ‘Pop Idol’ became compulsive viewing, attracting over 11 million viewers. The first ever winner, Will Young, picked up 4.6 million votes in a live final. Despite Simon favouring the runner-up, Gareth Gates, Will Young’s debut release 'Evergreen'/'Anything Is Possible', broke the record for the biggest selling debut single ever - reaching 1.8 million sales. Thanks to Simon cropping up in the ‘production’ credits of most of his artists' records, he has cleverly managed to secure himself a share of the royalties. Despite his successes, Simon has also turned down many bands that went on to find success elsewhere – most notably ‘The Spice Girls’ and ‘Take That’, simply because he thought Gary Barlow was too fat to be a star!Simon has now become a celebrity in his own right, serving as a judge on both the UK and US version of the ‘Pop Idol’ show. His straight-talking style has earned him various nicknames, including Mr Nasty and Judge Dread. He divides his time between the UK and America, and has set up his own production company, Syco TV, which co-produced the latest breed of talent show – ‘The X Factor'. Cowell announced that he would be leaving 'American Idol' at the start of 2010. He had been a judge on the show since 2002 and completed his final season on the US version of 'Pop Idol' that year. In 2006, Cowell signed to two record-breaking deals. In the US, he agreed to remain as a judge on American Idol, earning £20 million per series. He also has a deal with Fox which allows his production company to broadcast Got Talent and American Inventor on other networks. In the UK, he signed a multi-million pound "golden handcuffs" deal with ITV for three years, which gave ITV rights to his hit talent show 'The X Factor'. Life appears to very sweet indeed for Simon Cowell. The Sunday Times Rich List estimated that he earned £33.5m in one year alone in 2006, thanks to the global success of the 'Pop Idol' brand. Cowell signed the winner of the third 'X-Factor', Leona Lewis, to his music label SyCo and she has since had a host of number one singles and albums across the globe. He has since starred as a judge on the talent show in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. On 17April 2011 it was revealed by MTV News that Cowell would not be a judge on the 2011 series of the 'X-Factor' but would maintain a large backstage presence. Meanwhile, Cowell is currently appearing on the US version of the 'X-Factor', which started in September 2011 amid controversy as Cheryl Cole was 'sacked' as a judge on the show, allegedly by Cowell, due to her accent. He is currently engaged to Mezhgan Hussainy, who worked as his make-up artist until they became romantically involved 18 months ago.

Dear ,Simon  i am writing to suggest something,after watching the x-factor, the contestants work so hard and it is a dream, i feel that the top 3 should get rewarded, there is a million dollar prize for 1st place,how about 10,000.00 for second and third place, some of them have struggled, some of the stories of their life is so sad,they should be helped out a little,it would change lives.   
First off I just wanted to say that I absolutely love watching you, and then I was wondering if there was any truth to the rumor that you are dating Carmen Electra? ;)
AMERICAN IDOL WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.TO LOSE SIMON COWELL IS LIKE LOSING AN ARTIST AT THE LOUVE.THE MAN KNOWS TALENT AND IT IS AN EDUCATION TO SEE HIS RESPONCE TO AN ACT.IF YOU ARE GOOD YOU ARE GOOD AND IF YOUR NOT YOUR NOT. THE ARTISTS DESIRE DOES NOT COUNT. NOT ALWAYS POPULAR, BUT ALWAYS RIGHT. IT WOULD BE A HONOR TO MEET HIM SOME DAY AND SHOOT THE BREEZE. BEST OF LUCK TO THE MASTER SIMON COWELL.BILL PILGERMAYER
Simon Cowell refuses to watch himself on any of his television shows as he is too critical of himself.
YOU'VE got the ex-factor 4 me Simon!  You could make me ooh and aah anytime!P.S.  Do please, please sign Ridian - his Somewhere was fantastic.
Simon, I just want to say thank you for Il Divo. I adore them. I flew from Birmingham, AL and paid 1,500.00 for a ticket at  Radio City Music Hall as ticket master was sold out of decent seats. They are disgustingly handsome and bloody talented lads.  I'm a southern girl with a soft heart and when I hear them I feel my heart get so full emotions.  I've purchased all of their CD's and their DVD.  I purchased many CD's for Christmas gifts so my friends could catch on to this phenom.  I am so grateful to you for giving them to the world!!!  I'm 38 and happily married with a huge crush on people I'll never meet but I can dream!!! Thank you Thank you!!!! Paige
i think simon is a fair judge.He knows if the person has the ex factor or not.After all he been in the music buisness a long time.And it is to his gain  as well as the one who is going to thrive in the pop world.So Simon has to be absolutely certain if that one can sing.
ii divio are fantastic singers so good looking.But   Simon Cowel is soooo so handsome still.   To Simon XXX Thank you Simon for getting them   together.Will you Simon be  there in their show?
I like many people would love to watch The X Factor but am finding it increasingly embarrasing and cringe -making not to mention insulting to be expected to watch the pantomimesque performances of Louie Walsh and sharon Osbourne. It has become a contest of egos where the contestants are in the background, exploited and used as pawns. It's really awful television. What should be a great show is ruined by self-obsesssed over inflated personalities who think that they are interesting to watch. They would be if they forgot themselves and got down to the job in hand and displyed honesty and integrity.Simon Cowell seems to try to rise above it-and he does mostly. If there is to be another series of this I hope that they consider revamping it and getting rid of these two useless 'judges'and replace them with credible people who can contribute something innovative, enlightening, well just something worth listening to. Their sense of theatre, comedy, television is non existent-it's just soooooooooo bad

After a humble start in the post room at EMI, his meteoric rise began when he became a top A&R executive, signing huge acts from Westlife and Five to Robson & Jerome.

In Simon Cowell Chas Newkey-Burden finds out, interviewing friends and old colleagues, and lifting the lid on the professional and private life of one of Britain's most eligible batchelors.

       Insightful... learn what's driven Simon to success and about the family he cherishes to much (News of the World)
       Chas Newkey-Burden is a journalist who has written successful biographies of Amy Winehouse, Alexandra Burke and Paris Hilton, among others.
Simon Cowell: the Mr  Nasty & the Nice Man who brought Teletubbies & Mighty Morphin Rangers to our TVs!
I must admit that I have never been the greatest fan of Simon Cowell which is mainly due to his political perspective and has less to do with his Mr Nasty image and persona on Television. However, on reading this book, I still think his image is overrated and now I know why.  In a sense, Simon Cowell has been typecast to some extent that he has always been known as the harsh judge off X factor or American Idol, but what other people have said about him in this book makes you realise that he is far removed from that off screen.Nonetheless, personally speaking, I think his persona on screen is not an act, he is just being honest and true to 'himself, which is probably what most people admire him for'. The book in my view is an insightful look into Cowell's background of coming from a rich and affluent family with a sort of bratty childhood and upbringing that helped him to become the strong-minded,  and the very successful and the popular individual he is today. Chas Newkey-Burden writing style is very eloquent and readable and I read the book in a few hours and I found Simon Cowell's early life of growing up near Elstree Studios, his first business, his first ever kiss, being expelled from school and working as  a Runner for Stanley Kubrick after he (Kubrick) bought the Cowell family home very enlightening on what things in life shaped him. So, such an upbringing of being brought up  within  family that had strong roots are very important and hence  his love of finer things of life and then his personal (intimate) relationships and how he overcome those hardships in those areas of his life.The second strand of the book covers his professional growth/development and his meteoric rise to stardom, This biography covers all aspects of Simon Cowell's rise to fame and fortune, from Pop Stars to X factor and how he 'conquered' America's Got Talent from 2002/2006 onwards up to more recent times in 2010.I believe that  as to why has  Simon Cowell  has had so much unparalleled success in the Music industry is due to his first taste of success he achieved in the Music Industry after his Father (who worked for EMI) got him a job at EMI Music Publishing in the Mail Room. The nature of the work meant that Cowell had to sift through thousands of songs in the American Catalogue and it was slow work that required a lot patience and focus on the many hundreds of styles/genres of music and the other sub-genres and off-shoots. Therefore, Cowell had to decide which UK singer(s) and band(s) might be good fits for each song. In short, Cowell became an unrivaled authority on the EMI International Catalogue. Cowell was a quick learner and he eventually met up with some people from A&R other labels, and soon his formula was working so well that - within weeks he had nearly twenty songs tied-up with artists from other labels. To paraphrase, Newkey-Burden as outlined, at pages 35-36: "...It was the first time moment that Cowell proved, not least to himself, that he could make it in the Music business..." This for me, was the key defining moment for Cowell and for his air of confidence and his persona that can be traced back to this moment on that he had arrived in the Music business and there was no turning back. Over the years and decades he has continued  to portray this persona of self-belief  and confidence that he is in fact, an unrivaled authority in the music business across the globe. Obviously, there is always some one better than you and that is how life is the real world.Overall this book sheds some light on why life has been so kind to Simon Cowell (mainly due to his background and upbringing) and apart from some of the knock-backs and failures I/we all face and sometimes come across in life and I/we get up and bounce-back more determined than ever and this is exactly what he has done.To conclude, then, it is not surprising that in 2008, in a children Poll named Cowell: 'the most famous person  in the world'  The answer is laughable and maybe due to the fact that  he brought the Teletubbies and the Mighty Morphin Rangers and among other things to our TV screens during the 1990s and beyond. A must have/buy book! Read more ›
  i bought tis as my partne rlikes reading and so far she has found it very  to read and i am now vey happy
  good prezzie for sister in law kept her out of mischief and from round at house so much winner all round
  love it. Simon Cowell difficult times trying to reach his goal. Could not put the book down until I finished
  I have a love hate relationsip with Simon Cowell (loved Pop Idol, hate X Factor) so as a biography connoisseur I picked the book up with an open mind. Well the story is told with warmth and with the childhood pranks, teenage naughtyness and his rise to fame it's like getting to know him properly and he does come across as likeable. The author has a good turn of phrase which made the bits about X Factor tolerable. The early pics were sweet and could have been printed slightly more high quality maybe. 5 stars overall though.
  What I loved about this book is that Chas Newkey-Burden explores and weaves together two strands: the personal and the professional Simon Cowell. My view of Simon has always been that he's clever, that he performs a role, but that behind any outward nastiness he is a gentleman, a strong and driven individual. In reading this book, my views on Simon have been strengthened and reading the words, `I've never believed this is going to last forever' have made me like Mr Cowell even more.Within `Simon Cowell: The Unauthorized Biography', there is the exploring of Simon's childhood and his forming as a strong minded individual. Chas Newkey-Burden looks at Simon's life growing up near Elstree Studios, describing Simon's first ever business, his first ever kiss, his being expelled from school and how he became a runner for Stanley Kubbrick (after Kubbrick bought the Cowell family home). This book shows Simon's strong family roots, his love of the finer things, his intimate relationships and his overcoming of personal trauma.The other strand looks at Simon Cowell's professional growth. There is no doubt that Mr Cowell has experienced a spectacular rise into stardom. This biography tracks it all, from Pop Stars to X Factor and not forgetting just how Simon Cowell managed to crack America.I am left with a renewed admiration for Simon Cowell. Chas Newkey-Burden joins Simon's words with interviews given by the people who know Mr Cowell best. I found it compelling and devoured the book within hours.A must-read for anyone interested in the man behind the persona.
  It was ok, not an official book, but still enjoyed it, love Simon Crowell so this was always going to be a hit
  This was bought for a friend and she loved the reading of it and would recommend it to Simon Cowell fans

  I normally love biographies but this one is full of useless information, lots of facts and figures which are not really relevant. Read more

Height: 5'9" Hometown: Brighton, England, United Kingdom In a Relationship With:Lauren Silverman Best Quotes:“It's not our intention to be mean. That's just within us.”“No, what I am doing is kind by telling people who are useless 'Do something that you're good at'.”“So I would only feel guilt if I misled somebody who was terrible.”“What luxury would I take to a desert island? A mirror. It's true. I'd miss me.”“Talking to celebrities is too much effort. They all think the same.” 
Simon Cowell (born in Brighton, England on October 7, 1959) is a reality TV personality, entrepreneur, A&R executive, and TV producer. Mr. Cowell is best known for his sarcastic, arrogant, and often insulting remarks while judging contestants on one of the many TV shows he is involved in. America was most notably introduced to Simon through his years serving as the brutally honest judge on the panel ofAmerican Idol, alongside fellow judges Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul. He is the owner of SYCO, which produces both music and TV content. Through this venture, Simon has established The X-Factor in Britain and in the USA, along with Britain’s Got Talent and America’s Got Talent. He has also helped artists such as Leona Lewis, Susan Boyle, and boy-band One Direction climb the music charts! Simon has trademarked himself with his notoriously low V-neck t-shirts and a rather blunt and sarcastic attitude that leaves audiences floored at the words that come out of his mouth. He is respected around the world for his overtly honest opinions and for getting away with crushing contestants dreams while making us all laugh! This fall we will watch The X-Factor’s long awaited return with judges Demi Lovato, L.A. Reid, and Britney Spears.
Simon is best known for his cutting remarks as a former judge on American Idol and in his current position as a judge on The X-Factor. He is also well-recognized for being both a record and television producer.
Simon has been famously quoted saying that he will never find a wife because “ no one will want to marry” him. Simon is a “selfish, quite weird” kind of guy–his words not ours! He dated entertainment correspondent, Terri Seymour, for six years, and, most recently, broke off an engagement to makeup artist, Mezhgan Hussainy in 2012. In July 2013, it was revealed that Simon and his girlfriend, Lauren Silverman, who was previously married to a good friend, were expecting a baby together. The child, a boy named Eric, was born on Feb. 14, 2014.

Simon Cowell is an English television personality and entrepreneur. He became famous as a judge on various talent shows like Pop Idol, American Idol and The X factor. He is famous, or rather notorious, for his biting and sarcastic remarks and insults about contestants in the reality shows. A wealthy entrepreneur, he is the founder of the television and music production house, Syco, which produced the highly successful 'Got Talent' franchise in the U.S. and the U.K. As a youngster, he was thrown out of several schools due to his bad behaviour. He attended college, but dropped out before completing his degree. Concerned, his father arranged various job interviews for him which he deliberately sabotaged. He even got a chance to work as a runner on Stanley Kubrick's movie 'The Shining', but faced problems with his colleagues due to his ill-tempered behavior. His father managed him a job with EMI Music Publishing and here he rose to the position of an Artists and Repertoire (A&R) man. He was chosen to judge the British music television show, 'Pop Idol' along with Neil Fox and Nicki Chapman. He was noticed by the public for being the most rude and insensitive judge who did not think twice before passing bitter and insulting comments about the participantsa reputation that only got stronger as he moved on to judge other talent shows.
