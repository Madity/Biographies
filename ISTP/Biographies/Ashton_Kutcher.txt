My agent had told me about a series called "Teenage Wasteland" (later renamed That '70s Show (1998)) and I went in to read and told them I had to know if I had gotten the role by 3:45 that afternoon. I was supposed to tell NBC if I wanted the role on Wind on Water (1998) by 4:00 p.m. Luckily, I got the role on this show.". Wind on Water (1998) was canceled after two episodes.

The project was written and was to be directed by Alan J. Pakula but he died in an automobile accident before anything could start so the project was immediately canceled. Had it gone through, it would have also marked the screen debut of actor Josh Duhamel, who was going to play the second male lead.
      Promoted and attended the premiere of the romantic comedy Killers (2010) in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. [July 2010]
      [on his experience with James Van Der Beek and Rachael Leigh Cook on the set of Texas Rangers (2001)] In between scenes, we go up and play Nintendo 64. We just all hang out and have a good time.
      [on rapper Eminem and his music] I think he's got [guts] for saying what he said. People get way too worked up about that stuff instead of just enjoying it.
      I didn't even know guys modeled before that. I thought Fabio was the only male model, and I really didn't fit that bill.
      I don't believe that old cliché that good things come to those who wait. I think good things come to those who want something so bad they can't sit still.
      I'm a guy's guy. I don't comb my hair unless I have to, and I don't use lotions or fancy shampoos.
      [on is reputation for being a free spirit] I say whatever I think and whatever is on my mind, and I just hope that it comes out good. I just try to have a lot of fun.
      Modelling is the best because you have to look hot, which comes easy to me, you know. I'm blessed with that.
      [on his movie The Butterfly Effect (2004)] I thought that it was a fantastic metaphor for life, and pretty enlightening. And I appreciated the opportunity to play a character that's blind to the trauma that takes place in his life. The violence that is in the movie I thought was a fantastic metaphor for how blind we are as a society, and as a people, to the things that actually do happen on a day-to-day basis, and how we kind of just block them out. And whether it be through our media or whatever, we go, "Oh, it's not happening in my world, so it's not happening.". In the movie, there's a great representation of the violence with the kids, and the pedophilia, and these kind of things that the guys could have taken the easy road, and kind of squeamishly cut around, but they weren't afraid of it.
      [on filming sex scenes] You sort of try to set some ground rules. I think it was Sir Laurence Olivier who said "I apologize if I get aroused and I apologize if I do not get aroused.". There's always that awkward state of "Is this okay? Is that okay?". In between it's just like "Let's act like nothing happened.". Then you see how good an actor you really are.
      [on identifying with the challenges in the life of Steve Jobs] The only way to relate to something like that is to have some version in your own life and I've had that. I didn't hesitate because he's an iconic figure as much as I did because I have friends who loved him and cared about him. It isn't always a flattering portrayal, and I wanted to make sure the way I portrayed him was the way people who loved and respected him saw him.
      [in incorporating Steve Jobs' dietary regimen into his portrayal] Steve controlled a lot of his environment and over what he ate and what he put in his body. It was awful. I did a week where I just ate grapes, and I did a week where I just ate carrots, and then I backed into a slightly more vegetarian diet and ended up in the hospital. My blood sugar levels got really messed up and my pancreas levels were all out of whack, and I was in a lot of pain. Ultimately, I think I gained an understanding and an appreciation for the level of control in his life and his level of measured existence.
=======================================================
Christopher Ashton Kutcher (/ˈkʊtʃər/) (born February 7, 1978)[2] is an American actor, investor, producer, and former model.[3][4][5] He is known for his portrayal of Michael Kelso in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. He also created, produced, and hosted Punk'd and had lead roles in the Hollywood films Jobs, Dude, Where's My Car?, Just Married, The Butterfly Effect, The Guardian, and What Happens in Vegas. Kutcher currently stars as Walden Schmidt on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, since Charlie Sheen's firing from the show in 2011.
Kutcher was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to factory worker Larry M. Kutcher and Procter & Gamble employee Diane (Finnegan) Kutcher.[6][7] His father is of Czech descent and his mother is of Irish, German, and Czech ancestry.[8][9] Kutcher was raised in a "relatively conservative" Catholic family.[10] He has an older sister named Tausha and a fraternal twin brother named Michael, who had a heart transplant when the brothers were young children. Michael also has cerebral palsy and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization Reaching for the Stars.[11]
Michael's cardiomyopathy caused his home life to become increasingly stressful. He has stated that he "didn't want to come home and find more bad news about" his brother, and "[I] kept myself so busy that I didn't allow myself to feel".[12] Kutcher stated that when he was 13, he contemplated committing suicide in order to save his brother's life with a heart transplant; when he told his father he was considering jumping from a Cedar Rapids hospital balcony, his father dissuaded him from doing so shortly before doctors announced that a transplant had become available from an accident victim in another state.[13] Kutcher attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids for his freshman year, before his family moved to Homestead, Iowa, where he attended Clear Creek Amana High School. During high school, he developed a passion for acting and appeared in school plays. However, Kutcher's home life worsened as his parents divorced when he was 16. During his senior year, he broke into his high school at midnight with his cousin in an attempt to steal money; he was arrested leaving the scene. Kutcher was convicted of third-degree burglary and sentenced to three years' probation and 180 hours of community service. Kutcher stated that although the experience "straightened him out", he lost his girlfriend and anticipated college scholarships, and he was ostracized at school and in his community.[14]
Kutcher enrolled at the University of Iowa in August 1996, where his planned major was biochemical engineering, motivated by the desire to find a cure for his brother's heart ailment.[7] At college, Kutcher was kicked out of his apartment for being too "noisy" and "wild".[15] Kutcher stated, "I thought I knew everything but I didn't have a clue. I was partying, and I woke up many mornings not knowing what I had done the night before. I played way too hard. I am amazed I am not dead."[16] To earn money for his tuition, Kutcher worked as a college summer hire in the cereal department for the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids, and sometimes donated blood for money.[17] During his time at UI he was approached by a model scout at a bar[18] called "The Airliner" in Iowa City and was recruited to enter the "Fresh Faces of Iowa" modeling competition. After placing first, he dropped out of college and won a trip to New York City to the International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Convention. Following his stay in New York City, Kutcher returned to Cedar Rapids, before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.[15]
After participating in an IMTA competition (losing to Josh Duhamel) in 1998, Kutcher signed with Next modeling agency in New York, appeared in ads for Calvin Klein, and modeled in Paris and Milan.[19]
After his success in modeling, Kutcher moved to Los Angeles after his first audition,[20] was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series That '70s Show, from 1998 and to 2006. Kutcher was cast in a series of film roles; although he auditioned but was not cast for the role of Danny Walker in Pearl Harbor (2001) (the role went to Josh Hartnett), he starred in several comedy films, including Dude, Where's My Car? (2000), Just Married (2003), and Guess Who (2005). He appeared in the 2003 family film, Cheaper By The Dozen, playing a self-obsessed actor. His 2004 film The Butterfly Effect was a dramatic role for Kutcher, playing a conflicted young man who time travels; the film received mixed to negative reviews, but was a box office success.[14]
In 2003, Kutcher produced and starred in his own series, MTV's Punk'd, as the host. The series involved hidden camera tricks performed on celebrities. He is also an executive producer of the reality television shows Beauty and the Geek, Adventures in Hollyhood (based around the rap group Three 6 Mafia), The Real Wedding Crashers, and the game show Opportunity Knocks. Many of his production credits, including Punk'd, come through Katalyst Films, a production company he runs with partner Jason Goldberg.[21] A 2004 interviewer described Kutcher as a "hunky young actor [who] is heading in all different directions at once", including "the hot L.A. restaurant Dolce":
"If anything, I'm a trier," says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. "I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out—if That '70s Show got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career—I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week. It allows a lot of time for sitting around, which I always kind of filled with work."[22]
Because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of The Guardian, Kutcher was forced not to renew his contract for the eighth and final season of That '70s Show, although he did appear in the first four episodes of it (credited as a special guest star) and returned for the series finale.[14] Kutcher produced and starred in the 2010 action comedy, Killers, in which he played a hitman.[23] In May 2011, Kutcher was announced as Charlie Sheen's replacement on the series Two and a Half Men.[24] Kutcher's contract was for one year and was believed to be worth nearly $20 million.[25] His debut as the character Walden Schmidt, entitled "Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt", was seen by 28.7 million people on September 19, 2011. The Nielsen ratings company reported that figure was more than any episode in the show's first eight seasons, when Sheen starred in it.[26][27] As of August 2013, Kutcher earns $750,000 an episode.[28]
Beyond the entertainment world, Kutcher is also a venture capitalist and has had a highly successful career doing so. Kutcher has also successfully invested in several high technology startups.[29][30] Some of his investments include Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb, Path and Fab.com.[31] He is a co-founder of the venture capital firm A-Grade Investments.[32] On October 29, 2013, Lenovo announced that it has hired Kutcher as product engineer.[33]
Kutcher was part of the management team for Ooma, a tech start-up launched in September 2007. Ooma is in the Voice over Internet Protocol business and Kutcher's role was as Creative Director. He spearheaded a marketing campaign and produced viral videos to promote this service. Kutcher also created an interactive arm of Katalyst called Katalyst Media, with his partner from Katalyst Films, Jason Goldberg. Their first site was the animated cartoon Blah Girls. Ooma revamped its sales and marketing strategy with a new management team in the summer of 2008, replacing Kutcher as their creative director. Rich Buchanan, from Sling Media, became Ooma's Chief Marketing Officer.
Kutcher has invested in an Italian restaurant, Dolce[14] (other owners include Danny Masterson and Wilmer Valderrama) and a Japanese-themed restaurant named Geisha House with locations in Atlanta, Los Angeles and New York City.
In 2009, Kutcher established an international human rights organization with his then wife, Demi Moore. DNA Foundation, later known as Thorn, works to address the sexual exploitation of children and the proliferation of child pornography on a global scale.[34]
On March 23, 2011, Kutcher launched his own Twitter client with UberMedia, called A.plus. While the app was initially available exclusively for desktop computers with Adobe Air installed, it eventually became available on mobile platforms, for iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry. In order to download on one of the 3 mobile platforms, users must first have the UberSocial client installed on their device, and then proceed to the device's browser to download A.plus.[35][36]
In 2003, Kutcher began dating actress Demi Moore. Moore and Kutcher married on September 24, 2005,[37] in a private ceremony conducted by a Rabbi of the Kabbalah Center. The wedding was attended by about 150 close friends and family of the couple, including Bruce Willis, Moore's ex-husband.[38] Kutcher and Moore met with co-director of the Kabbalah Center Rabbi Yehuda Berg in Israel in October 2010.[39] On November 17, 2011, Moore released a statement announcing her intention to end her marriage to Kutcher.[40] After over a year of separation, Kutcher filed for divorce from Moore on December 21, 2012, in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.[41] Moore filed her response papers in March 2013, requesting spousal support and payment of legal fees from Kutcher.[42] On November 27, 2013, the divorce was finalized.[37]
Kutcher began dating his former That '70s Show co-star, Mila Kunis, in April 2012.[43] In February 2014, it was announced that the couple became engaged.[44] In May 2014, Kunis confirmed to Ellen DeGeneres that she and Kutcher were engaged and expecting their first child together.[45]
Kutcher is a self-described fiscal conservative and social liberal.[46] He has been a student of Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah), for several years.[47] His No Strings Attached co-star, Natalie Portman, stated in 2011 that Kutcher "has taught me more about Judaism than I think I have ever learned from anyone else".[48] In trips to Israel, Kutcher visited Kabbalah centers in Tel Aviv and in Tsfat.[47] In 2013, Kutcher remarked that "Israel is near and dear to my heart..... coming to Israel is sort of coming back to the source of creation – trying to get closer to that. And as a creative person, going to the source of creation is really inspiring. And this place has been really inspiring for me – not only on a spiritual level, but also on an artistic and creative level."[49] On September 17, 2008, Kutcher was named the assistant coach for the freshman football team at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. However, he was unable to return in 2009 because he was filming Spread.[50][51] In February 2011, Kutcher sold his Hollywood Hills home, which he originally bought in 2004.[52] In April 2012, Kutcher became the 500th paying customer to sign up to ride Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo.[53]
On April 16, 2009, Kutcher became the first user of Twitter to have more than 1,000,000 followers,[54] beating CNN in the site's "Million followers contest".[55][56] Kutcher announced via Twitter that he would be donating $100,000 to a charity to fight malaria. However, there have been several reports that Twitter manipulated the contest's results by preventing users from "unfollowing" Kutcher or CNN.[57] In November 2011, Kutcher received much criticism for his tweet in response to the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal calling the firing of Penn State Nittany Lions football coach Joe Paterno in "poor taste".[58] Kutcher subsequently turned over management of his Twitter account to his team at the Katalyst Media company.[59]
In April 2011, Kutcher and wife Demi Moore began a public service announcement campaign claiming that "Real Men" do not engage the services of child prostitutes who are the victims of human trafficking.[60] Kutcher's claims that 100,000 to 300,000 American children were sold into sexual slavery were criticized by newspaper the Village Voice, which gave evidence refuting the claims. Kutcher may have understood a study referring to minors "at risk" for sexual exploitation as referring to children actually being prostituted. Experts estimate the true numbers to be in the hundreds, not the hundreds of thousands.[61] Kutcher reacted to the criticism by accusing the Village Voice of promoting child prostitution and using Twitter to request that Village Voice advertisers including American Airlines, Disney, the City of Seattle, and Domino's Pizza withdraw their advertising from publications owned by the Voice's parent company.[62][63]

=======================================================
Profile of the Punk'd prankster and former model, who rose to fame on That 70s Show, before cementing his star status with a host of Hollywood hits and a marriage to Demi Moore.
Ashton Kutcher was born to parents Larry and Diane Kutcher, who both had jobs as factory workers at varying times. As a child growing up in Iowa, young Ashton lived on a farm with his parents, where he enjoyed the country lifestyle of an average Midwestern youngster. Ashton also had an older sister Tausha, as well as a fraternal twin brother, who was called Michael. Sadly, his brother Michael suffered from cerebral palsy.
When Ashton reached the age of 13, his family life went through a very difficult patch. His parents' marriage broke up and they divorced soon afterwards. Things got even more stressful for Ashton, since around the same time his twin brother Michael underwent an emergency heart transplant; this was apparently prompted by a condition called cardiomyopathy, a virus-related illness that had perforated Michael’s heart muscle. Although Michael's operation went smoothly, the seriousness of his condition had a profound effect on Ashton, who subsequently decided to enrol for a degree course in biochemical engineering at the University of Iowa, with the avowed aim of one day discover a cure for his brother's illness.
In order to finance his studies, Ashton worked on a variety of odd jobs, including carpentry and farm labouring. At one stage, he even took a job as a cereal dust sweeper at the General Mills Plant in Cedar Rapids. In addition, Ashton reacted badly to this difficult time at home and has since said that he became quite depressed.
He attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he excelled at sports, before his mother decided to move away from Cedar Rapids to Tiffin, Iowa, with her new partner. During Ashton's senior year at Clear Creek-Amana High School, he reportedly broke into the high school at night with his cousin, to try and steal some money. He was caught leaving the scene and convicted of third-degree burglary. As a result, Ashton was sentenced to three years' probation and 180 hours of community service. He is on record as saying that this difficult experience 'straightened him out', but his girlfriend at the time broke up with him as a result of his conviction.
Although he decided to enrol at the University of Iowa in order to find a cure for his brother’s illness, Ashton didn't complete his studies. He was desperately poor at this stage of his life and often donated blood, in order to make money. Ashton was reportedly thrown out of his apartment for being too 'noisy and wild' and says of this period in his life: 'I thought I knew everything, but I didn't have a clue. I was smoking a lot of weed and partying and I woke up many mornings not knowing what I had done the night before. I played way too hard. I'm amazed I'm not dead.'
Ashton had already become interested in theatre whilst still at school, when he made his debut in a 7th grade production of 'The Crying Princess and the Golden Goose'. However his entry into the entertainment business proper actually came about in a rather roundabout way. One night, he was hanging out at a bar called The Airliner in Iowa City when he was approached by a talent scout who had been impressed by his good looks and invited him to enter a competition called the 'Fresh Faces of Iowa'. Ashton came first in the competition - his prize was a trip to New York in order to participate in an International Modelling and Talent Association (IMTA) Convention. Ashton lost out to Josh Duhamel but then succeeded in getting signed up to the Next modelling agency in New York, where he launched his modelling career. He appeared in ads for Calvin Klein and Versace, and was even engaged for modelling jobs in Paris and Milan. Having pursued a successful career as a male model, turning his hand to acting seemed like the logical next step. So in 1997, Ashton decided to move to Los Angeles and try his luck on the audition circuit.
Happily, it didn't take long for Ashton to receive his first big break - in fact, it happened almost straight away. He went for an audition for a role at NBC and was told that he hadn't been successful. But just as he was leaving, Ashton was called back into the studio by an executive who asked him to read for a new pilot show called 'Wind On Water'. Ashton says: 'I went and did a cold reading of the character and found out that I had gotten the job but I told them I had to read the script first. After reading it, I decided I didn't want to be a cowboy surfer! My agent had told me about a series called 'Teenage Wasteland' (later renamed 'That '70s Show') and I went in to read for that. I told them I had to know if I'd gotten the role by 3:45 pm, because I was supposed to tell NBC if I wanted the role in 'Wind On Water' by 4:00pm!' Ashton was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series, 'That '70s Show', which made its TV debut in 1998. The show was highly successful and ran until 2006. In retrospect, he'd made a very wise choice, since 'Wind On Water' turned out to be a flop and was cancelled after only two episodes.
Following his runaway success on the small screen, it was only a matter of time before the Hollywood producers began calling for Ashton. He broke through into movie acting in a succession of comedy roles to begin with, such as 'Dude, Where’s My Car?' (2000), and the romantic comedy 'Down To You' (2000). Ashton followed up this early movie success with the family film 'Cheaper By The Dozen', where he played a narcissistic young actor. In 2004, Ashton began to branch out into more serious roles, such as 'The Butterfly Effect', where he played a young man who struggles with various inner conflicts, and then falls in love with a girl called Kayleigh: the film received mixed reviews from the critics, but was nevertheless a substantial box office success. Ashton himself has said that he felt the film was a 'fantastic metaphor for how blind people often are to the things that actually happen to them on a day to day basis'.
'Guess Who' (2005) saw him delve into the issue of racial relationships in a comedy that was a loose remake of the 1967 film 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner', which starred Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier and Katharine Hepburn. During the same year 'A Lot Like Love' and stop motion animated television series 'Robot Chicken' were released before Ashton appeared in director Emilio Estevez' drama 'Bobby' in 2006.
He briefly departed from his comedic roles in the same year when he teamed up with Kevin Costner for action-adventure drama 'The Guardian', but was soon back onside with computer-animated comedy 'Open Season' in which he played a voice role. Although many of the characters he played before were never lead roles, this was soon to change.
'What Happens in Vegas' (2008) saw him become a leading man when he appeared alongside Cameron Diaz in the romantic comedy, which paved the way for 'Spread' and 'Personal Effects' in (2009). 2010 saw him join an ensemble cast including Julia Roberts, Bradley Cooper, Jessica Alba, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner in 'Valentine's Day', which was a commercial success. With his box office appeal increasing, Ashton also appeared alongside Katherine Heigl in 'Killers' (2010).
Off screen too, Ashton was attracting plenty of media attention, thanks to the ups and downs of his personal life. Having dated several actresses - January Jones, Ashley Scott, Monet Mazur and Brittany Murphy - in swift succession, he then began dating actress Demi Moore early in 2003, shortly after his break-up with Brittany Murphy. Ashton's new relationship provoked great interest in the media, on account of the age difference between him and Ms Moore - fifteen years his senior. Moore also had three children by her marriage to Bruce Willis. Notwithstanding these factors, Ashton and Demi were married on 24 September 2005, in a private ceremony officiated over by a rabbi of the Kabbalah Centre. Demi and Ashton are both staunch devotees of Kabbalah, which is a mystical Jewish sect. As part of their spiritual discipline, they both toured Israel together and are keen observers of Jewish High Holy Days.
As well as being a leading Hollywood actor, Ashton has also proved to be a talented businessman and producer. In 2003, he produced and starred in his own MTV series, called 'Punk'd'. The programme involved various hidden cameras being used to play tricks on unsuspecting celebrities and proved to be very popular. Ashton also took the role of executive producer on the series 'Beauty And The Geek', which was launched in 2005. He has since served as executive producer in a number of productions including 'Adventures in Hollyhood', 'The Real Wedding Crashers', 'The Beautiful Life' and his 2010 film 'Killers'.
Ashton now runs a production company called Katalyst Films, in conjunction with his partner Jason Goldberg, through which he has obtained many of his production credits, including Punk'd.
In 2010, Kutcher's two major releases of the year, 'Valentine's Day' and 'Killers', garnered the actor Razzie Worst Actor award nominations – with the star winning the award for the latter.
Outside of his film work, Ashton Kutcher has gained notable press on the social media website Twitter, becoming the first person to gain one million followers in April 2009.
In April 2011, Kutcher was criticised by US magazine the Village Voice, for reportedly misquoting figures related to child prostitution in the US, during a publicity campaign alongside wife Demi Moore.
Kutcher took to Twitter to express his anger at the Village Voice, calling on the magazine's sponsors to withdrawing advertising from the publication.
A month later though, Kutcher was back in headlines for the right reasons, after agreeing a one year deal worth $20 million dollars to star in the sitcom 'Two and Half Men', replacing the previously axed Charlie Sheen.
Ashton Kutcher's debut on the show in September 2011 was watched by 28.7 million Americans, a new record for the sitcom.

From All Movie Guide: Having acquired legions of loyal female followers with his portrayal of the ever-horny and dimwitted Kelso in the popular television comedy series That 70s Show, it may come as a surprise that male model-turned-actor Ashton Kutcher ironically majored in biochemical engineering at the University of Iowa before his "discovery" in an Iowa bar and subsequent stint on the catwalk for such fashion industry luminaries as Versace and Calvin Klein.Born in Cedar Rapids, IA, along with a fraternal twin named Michael, Kutcher was bitten by the acting bug in high school. Balancing his love for the stage with his talent for wrestling before gravitating toward the former in such high school productions as {+Annie}, Kutcher worked numerous odd jobs during his tenure at the University of Iowa before winning the Fresh Faces of Iowa contest in 1997 and heading for New York. Competing in that same year's International Model and Talent Agency competition before being signed to the next agency, Kutcher relocated to Los Angeles the following year and soon landed his breakthrough role on That 70s Show. Though he had small roles in Down to You and Reindeer Games (both 2000), Kutcher's first major big-screen role was in Dude, Where's My Car? (also 2000), in which he teamed his airheaded goofiness with that of American Pie's Sean William Scott. Breaking out of the mold with a more serious turn alongside James Van Der Beek in 2001's Texas Rangers, a return to comedy wasn't far behind with a role in My Boss's Daughter scheduled for release later that same year. Though My Boss's Daughter would ultimately be pushed back to a late February 2003 release date, Kutcher and actress Brittany Murphy (8 Mile) scored a modest hit when Just Married was released into theaters in early January of the same year. Despite receiving only a lukewarm reception from critics, positive audience turnout ensured that Just Married would nevertheless hold on to a position in the box office top-ten for nearly a month after its release. Though My Boss's Daughter failed to stir up much at the box-office, the one-two punch of his immensely popular MTV prank show Punk'd and a high-profile romance with Demi Moore (whom he later married and then divorced) shot Kutcher's celebrity stock through the roof in 2003. He subsequently closed out the year with a self-depricating role in the holiday hit Cheaper by the Dozen.2004 saw Kutcher trying his hand at drama once again with the supernatural thriller The Butterfly Effect. Though the reviews were mixed, the film had its share of fans among critics and went on to makeup its budget more than three-times over. Kutcher continued finding success on the small-screen by producing the series Beauty and the Geek. In 2005 he teamed with Bernie Mac for the racial comedy Guess Who, and 2006 found Kutcher trying his hand at more action oriented fare teaming up with Kevin Costner for The Guardian. The actor would continue to find his place in the romcom niche with 2008's What Happens in Vegas, 2010's Valentine's Day and 2011's No Strings Attached, but made particular waves with a return to television, when he famously signed on to replace Charlie Sheen on the sitcomn Two and a Half Men in 2011. His movie career slowed due to his television commitments, but he did find time to play Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in the 2013 bio-drama Jobs. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
