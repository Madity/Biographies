Phillip Dennis "Phil" Ivey Jr.[1] (born February 1, 1976) is an American professional poker player who has won nine World Series of Poker bracelets, one World Poker Tour title and appeared at nine World Poker Tour final tables. Ivey is regarded by numerous poker observers and contemporaries as the best all-round player in the world today.[2][3][4]
Ivey first began to develop his poker skills by playing against co-workers at a New Brunswick, New Jersey, telemarketing firm in the late 1990s. One of his nicknames, "No Home Jerome", stems from the ID card he secured to play poker in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in his teenage years.[5] He was given the nickname "The Phenom" after winning three World Series of Poker bracelets in 2002. His other nickname is "the Tiger Woods of Poker".[6]
Ivey's tournament accomplishments include winning three bracelets at the 2002 World Series of Poker, tying Phil Hellmuth Jr, Ted Forrest, and Puggy Pearson for most tournament wins in a single year (Jeff Lisandro has also since tied the record).[7] Ivey also has bracelets in Pot Limit Omaha from 2000 and 2005. In 2000, he was the first person to defeat Amarillo Slim heads-up at a WSOP final table.[8] In addition to his nine World Series bracelets, Ivey has had great success in the WSOP Main Event. He placed in the top 25 four times between the 2002 World Series of Poker and the 2009 World Series of Poker. Ivey finished 23rd in 2002, 10th in 2003, 20th in 2005 and 7th in 2009.
In 2009, Ivey won his 6th bracelet in the $2,500 No-Limit 2-7 Draw Lowball Event of the 2009 WSOP. He defeated a field of 147 players to catch his bracelet. He won a very long heads-up battle against John Monette. He then proceeded to win another bracelet in the $2,500 1/2 Seven Card Stud Hi/Lo 1/2 Omaha Hi/Lo event besting a field of 376 people. He defeated Ming Lee heads-up. While winning the $2,500 1/2 Seven Card Stud Hi/Lo - 1/2 Omaha Hi/Lo event he also managed to place 22nd in the $5000 Pot-Limit Omaha Eight-or-better despite only playing during the breaks in the Stud/Omaha event.
At the 2010 WSOP Ivey won his eighth bracelet in the $3,000 H.O.R.S.E. event in a final table made up of other notable players, which included Bill Chen (2nd), John Juanda (3rd), Jeff Lisandro (5th) and Chad Brown (8th).[10]
Between 2002 and 2009, Ivey finished among the top 25 players in the Main Event four times, in fields ranging in size from 600 entrants to just under 7000.[citation needed] Ivey finished 10th in the 2003 WSOP Main Event (one place short of the final table), and 7th in 2009. In 2009 his A♣ K♠ lost to Darvin Moon's A♦ Q♠ when a queen paired Moon on the flop; he ended with winnings of $1,404,002.
With 9 World Series of Poker bracelets, Ivey is currently tied with Johnny Moss for the fourth most all-time. Also, at age 37, he is the youngest player to ever win nine (Phil Hellmuth was 39). In addition, no other player has accumulated nine bracelets more quickly; it took Ivey only 13 years from the time of his first bracelet to his ninth (Phil Hellmuth took 14 years). He is also the all-time record holder for most bracelets won in non-Holdem events, with all 9 of his victories coming in non-Holdem events. His 2010 win gave him the lead over Billy Baxter. He is also the WSOP record holder for most mixed-game bracelets having won four in his career. He won one in S.H.O.E. in 2002, Omaha Hi/Lo / 7 Card Stud Hi/Lo in 2009, H.O.R.S.E. in 2010 and a WSOP APAC Mixed Event in 2013.
Ivey has also reached nine final tables on the World Poker Tour. He has lost several of these WPT events by being eliminated while holding the same starting hand each time, an ace and a queen. Nine out of the twelve times Ivey has cashed in a WPT event, he has also made the television final table. During the sixth season of the WPT in February 2008, Ivey made the final table at the LA Poker Classic at Commerce Casino that included Phil Hellmuth and Nam Le, eventually capturing the $1,596,100 first prize and putting an end to his streak of seven WPT final tables without a victory. Ivey has earned close to three million dollars in WPT cashes. Ivey made his debut on the European Poker Tour in Barcelona, September 2006. He came to the final table of nine as the chipleader, but he eventually came in second to Bjørn-Erik Glenne from Norway.
In 2006, Ivey played in The London All Star Challenge of the inaugural European Poker Masters. Ivey made it to the final table to finish seventh, and collected £6,700 ($12,534). In November 2005, Ivey won the $1,000,000 first prize at the Monte Carlo Millions tournament. The following day, Ivey took home another $600,000 for finishing first at "The FullTiltPoker.Net Invitational Live from Monte Carlo". His six opponents were (in reverse finishing order) Mike Matusow, Phil Hellmuth, Gus Hansen, Chris Ferguson, Dave Ulliott, and John Juanda.
On the January 22, 2007 airing of NBC's Poker After Dark, Ivey won the $120,000 winner-take-all "Earphones Please" tournament by eliminating Matusow, Tony G, Andy Bloch, Hellmuth, and Sam Farha. On the April 15, 2007 airing of NBC's "National Heads-Up Poker Championship", Ivey was defeated by actor Don Cheadle. That was the third consecutive year where Ivey was eliminated in the first round of this tournament. His streak ended in 2008, when he advanced to the semifinals, losing to eventual champion Ferguson. Ivey took part in seasons three and six of GSN's High Stakes Poker.
On January 29, 2012 Ivey won the Aussie Millions A$250,000 High-roller event, defeating Patrik Antonius heads-up for a prize of A$2,000,000, at the time placing him 2nd in the all-time career tournament earnings. Ivey had also placed 12th at the Aussie Millions main event for a prize of A$100,000.[11]
On February 10, 2014 Ivey won the 2014 Aussie Millions LK Boutique $250,000 Challenge for AU$4,000,000 — the largest single cash of his career.
As of 2014[update], Ivey's total live tournament winnings exceed $20,000,000. He has also won millions playing online and in cash games.[12] $5,294,840 of his total winnings have come from cashes at the WSOP. He is currently ranked 2nd on the all time money list, behind Antonio Esfandiari.[13]
Ivey is a regular participant in the $4,000-$8,000 mixed cash game at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas (often referred to as the Big Game). In February 2006, he played heads-up Limit Texas Hold'em versus Texas billionaire Andy Beal. With stakes at $25,000/$50,000 and $50,000/$100,000, Ivey won over $16,000,000 over the course of three days, during a heads up match at The Wynn Resort. Ivey was playing for "The Corporation", a group of poker professionals who pooled their money and took turns playing against Beal. Earlier in the month, Beal had beaten the Corporation out of over $13,000,000.
Ivey was part of the original design team for Full Tilt Poker. In May 2011, Ivey filed a lawsuit in Clark County, Nevada claiming Full Tilt had breached his contract. The suit asked for damages in excess $150,000,000, as well as for him to be released from his contract with the company.[14] Ivey voluntarily withdrew the suit on June 30.[15]
According to HighStakesDB.com, Ivey won $1.99 million on FullTilt in 2007, $7.34 million in 2008, $6.33 million in 2009 and $3 million in 2010.[16]
In August 2012, Ivey was reported to have won £7.3 million (approx. $11 million) playing Punto Banco at Crockfords, a casino in London, but was refused payment beyond his initial £1 million stake due to Ivey's use of edge sorting.[17] Ivey issued a statement through his lawyers denying any misconduct: "Any allegations of wrongdoing by Crockfords are denied by me in the very strongest of terms."[18] In April of 2014, The Borgata Casino in Atlantic City sued Ivey claiming he cheated at baccarat by taking advantage of a defect in the manufacturing of the playing cards.[19] Both Crockfords and the Borgata used the same kind of playing cards, manufactured by Gemaco. The Borgata is suing Gemaco as well as Ivey.[20][21]
Ivey was born in Riverside, California and moved to Roselle, New Jersey, when he was three months old.[22]
Ivey resides in Las Vegas. In December 2009, Ivey and his wife, Luciaetta, filed a joint petition for divorce after seven years of marriage. The divorce was granted on December 29, 2009.[23]
Ivey is a Los Angeles Lakers, Houston Rockets, and Buffalo Bills fan and can often be seen wearing basketball jerseys. Ivey's hobbies include video games, prop betting and golf. He participated in the inaugural World Series of Golf, where he finished in third place.
Ivey has given money to a number of charitable causes.[24] In March 2008, Ivey donated $50,000 to Empowered 2 Excel, a Las Vegas charity for underprivileged children, and later that week created the Budding Ivey Foundation, a non-profit organization to continue the work of his grandfather, Leonard "Bud" Simmons.[25] The foundation raised $260,000 (mostly for Empowered 2 Excel) at a July 3, 2008 charity poker tournament,[26] and is also involved in children's literacy projects and programs to feed the homeless.[27]
Ivey has also founded two companies. Ivey Poker, established in 2012 offers a "play for free" poker App that allows users to compete against Ivey and other pros.[28] Ivey League is a poker training site with a full roster of professional coaches launched in 2014.[29]

Phil Ivey was born in Riverside, California, but moved to New Jersey at a very young age and grew up in the Jersey area. Phil started playing poker when he was working at a telemarketing firm in Jersey with his co-workers and soon started going to Atlantic City. Ivey had managed to get himself a fake ID so that he could go to Atlantic City and play poker in his teenage years.
Ivey is one of the most well known Poker Stars in the world and also one of the most accomplished poker players in history. Throughout Phil’s career he has won five WSOP satellite bracelets and made thirty money finishes as well in WSOP events. Phil has also won one WPT title and eight final tables which is more then anyone else in WPT events. Phil also has some experience playing in EPT events and he finishes second place in 2006 at an EPT event in Barcelona. The five WSOP bracelets that Phil has won in his career all came within six years from 2000-2005 which goes to show you how quickly he has amassed his bracelets. Most poker players who have played 10-20 years don’t have any bracelets in the WSOP events, but Phil has already won five and should win more before he retires from poker.
Phil Ivey has been spending less time playing in tournaments the past couple years and spends more time playing cash games because the money is much better. Phil lives in Vegas now and can often be found at the Bellagio playing in the $4000/$8000 mixed game with other highrollers. Ivey’s biggest win in his career came in a heads-up cash match against Andy Beal in Vegas where he won a total of sixteen million in only three days of poker. The blinds were $25000/$50000 and limit Texas Holdem was the game that was played.
Ivey is also apart of the Full Tilt Tournament Team and often plays in the online poker room when he isn’t playing live cash games. There is usually a game every night or so on Full Tilt and Phil is often apart of the game so you can watch him play against other pros online anytime you want at Full Tilt. Phil has also appeared on lots of television shows over the years including Poker After Dark, High Stakes Poker and many other poker shows. When you have won as much as Phil Ivey has you often get the call to appear on television shows before other players.
Phil is married and currently doesn’t have any children although that might change within a couple years. When Ivey isn’t playing poker he enjoys watching basketball games and his favourite teams are the Lakers and Rockets. Phil also likes playing video games, golfing and betting on prop bets with his friends. There is no doubt that most poker players know exactly who Phil Ivey is and many people want to become the next Ivey. He has had a lot of success in a little amount of time and is now living a great life in Vegas playing poker, golfing and betting with friends.

Phil IveyPhil Ivey Biographyby Damian M. Moorman, Predictem.com StaffPhil Ivey is considered by many as the greatest poker player alive.  He has taken over this title from the late Chip Reese and has earned every bit of respect given to him by his peers.Ivey was born on February 1, 1976 in Riverside, California.  He grew up in New Jersey, as he moved there when he was just a few months old.  He played under the name Jerome with his fake ID and honed his Holdem skills at a very young age in Atlantic City.Phil Ivey is extremely dangerous at many poker games, especially No-limit Holdem.  He plays completely fearless and has amazing instincts.  Ivey plays small pot poker, similar to Phil Hellmuth Jr. and Daniel Negreanu, because he realizes he has the biggest edge on his opponents post-flop.He came into the spotlight in the poker world at the World Series of Poker in 2002 where he won three bracelets that year!  Phil Iveys three wins in the same year at the WSOP ties him with Ted Forrest and Phil Hellmuth Jr. for the most ever in the same year.  His biggest cash at the WSOP came with his fifth bracelet in 2005, when he won the $5,000 buy-in Pot Limit Omaha championship for $635,603.  He is also known for his great results in the main event.  Between 2002 and 2005, he finished in the top 25 three separate times.Ivey has also faired well at World Poker Tour events.  He has made over 1.3 million dollars and made seven final tables.  Ivey also made a final table, finishing second place, at his first ever European Poker Tour event.  No one is safe from Phil Ivey when he sits down at the poker table.

In 2005, Ivey took home $1,000,000 when he won the Monte Carlo Millions.  Just one day after that million dollar cash, Ivey won the FullTiltPoker.net Invitational for $600,000.  Not a bad two-day pay day!Ivey is one of the most well known tournament Holdem players ever, but he is considered a cash game player at heart.

Phil Ivey needs no introduction. If you are even a casual fan of poker then you surely know who Phil Ivey is.
Ivey is often regarded as the best all-around poker player in the world, not only by fans of the game, but also by his peers. When you look at his results, you can't really argue with this assertion - he has enjoyed an incredible amount of success in both tournaments and cash games. Most often a really good tournament player will not fare well in cash games, and vice versa. Ivey is one of the few players who has consistently beaten the "Big Game" while enjoying tournament success at the same time.
Phil Ivey was born on February 1st, 1976 in Riverside, California. His family moved to New Jersey when he was just three months old. This is where Phil Ivey would grow up and learn the game of poker.
He was introduced to the world of gambling by his grandfather. When Phil Ivey was eight years old, his grandfather pulled out a deck of cards and taught his grandson how to play five card stud. They were playing for pennies a hand. Phil Ivey was instantly hooked, and the love of gambling never left his blood.
Phil Ivey had a love of gaming that continued to grow throughout his childhood. Not only did he possess a love for cards, but he also had a passion for video games which still exists today.
By the time he was 16, Phil Ivey was a regular in a home poker game that was hosted by his friend's father. Ivey was a great deal better than everyone else at the table and soon got tired of taking all of their money. He lusted for a bigger challenge, and soon set his eyes on Atlantic City. When his family and teachers asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, Ivey would confidently respond "a professional gambler".
At the age of 18, Phil Ivey obtained a fake ID and would regularly make the trip to Atlantic City. He became a fixture at the tables, inspiring his first nickname of "No Home Jerome". The name on Phil Ivey's fake ID read "Jerome Graham", and the "No Home" part of the nickname referred to the fact that Ivey seemingly never left the tables.
If you think that Ivey immediately started beating these games in Atlantic City, then you would be wrong. He initially lost money but kept at it and eventually turned into a profitable player. He often tells other players that the best way to improve your game is to just put in the hours. After putting in many hours at the Tropicana Casino in Atlantic City, Ivey became a profitable player and built the foundation for a successful poker career.
At the age of 20, Phil Ivey moved to Atlantic City so that he could be closer to the games. Less travel time would mean more time at the tables.
When he turned 21, Ivey walked into the Tropicana Casino and told the shift manager that his name was actually Phil, and not Jerome. The shift manager just laughed it off as Ivey was a well-liked and respected client of the establishment. Exit "Jerome Graham", enter Phil Ivey.
Ivey's humble nature and constant thirst to learn about the game of poker endeared him to many other poker pros. He quickly became friends with the likes of Barry Greenstein, who eventually introduced Ivey to the "Big Game" in Las Vegas. Ivey was impressed by the lifestyle that Greenstein was living and wanted to enjoy the same level of success.
Over the years, Ivey built up quite an impressive resume in both tournament and cash game play. Barry Greenstein once remarked that Phil Ivey was the best tournament poker player in the world, and the only player to successfully transition from tournament poker to beating the "Big Game".
Ivey has nearly $14 million in all-time tournament cashes, which currently puts him at #2 on the all-time money list behind Daniel Negreanu ($14,116,192). Over the past few years, Ivey has managed to surge past the likes of Phil Hellmuth and Joe Hachem, thanks in large part to his recent strong performances at the World Series of Poker. 
He once remarked that his goal was "30" World Series of Poker bracelets. Does anybody actually doubt that he could do it?
He has a total of 40 lifetime World Series of Poker cashes. He came close to winning the Main Event in both 2003 and 2009. In 2003, he was eventually eliminated in 10th place by Chris Moneymaker. His bust-out hand was especially painful:
Ivey had pocket nines and Chris Moneymaker held A-Q offsuit. The flop came q 6 q, giving Moneymaker trip Queens. The turn brought a 9, giving Phil Ivey the full house. The players got all of their chips in the middle. The river brought an Ace, giving Moneymaker a full house and eliminating the best player left in the tournament. Moneymaker went on to win (as you all know).
In 2009, Ivey made the "November Nine" final table, eventually finishing in seventh place for $1,404,014. Here is the bustout hand:
These weren't the only times that Ivey went deep in the Main Event. He finished 23rd in 2002 and 20th in 2005.
Phil Ivey has also had a great deal of success in World Poker Tour events. He has nine cashes in WPT events and a ridiculous eight final tables. His streak of eight final tables after cashing was halted at the 2008 World Poker Challenge.
Ivey took down his first WPT event at the 2008 LA Poker Classic. Prior to this, Ivey had made 7 World Poker Tour final tables without actually winning. Ivey cashed for $1.596 million dollars in this event.
He also has one cash in an EPT event, and that came at the 2006 EPT Barcelona Open where he finished in second place for $470k.
Phil Ivey also has a number of other notable tournament victories, including a win at the 2005 Monte Carlo Millions for $1 million dollars and a first place finish at the $120k No Limit Hold'em Full Tilt Poker Invitational for $600k the very same week. Ivey also has two Poker After Dark wins in seven appearances (he has also finished in second place twice, in third place twice and in fifth place once).
As you can see, Phil Ivey has done very well for himself on the tournament poker scene. He is only 34 years old and he generally prefers to play cash games instead of tournaments, which makes his accomplishments all the more impressive.
As mentioned, Phil Ivey is one of the top cash game players in the world. He has been a fixture in the "Big Game" for years and has been one of the biggest winners in the game. He is also a consistent winner online, having had some notable battles with the likes of "seda1" and "Ziigmund". Ivey won't shy away from any challenge, and certainly has the bankroll to play just about anyone that he wants.
Ivey had a memorable battle with billionaire Andy Beal a few years ago. Ivey, along with a group of other professional poker players that called themselves the "Corporation", battled Andy Beal in an ultra high-stakes game of Limit Hold'em that stretched out over several years. Andy Beal was a math genius and developed a "perfect" method of playing Limit Hold'em that would involve giving off no tells at all. He had every move perfectly timed and played the game according to a strict plan that he had devised for himself.
As mentioned, this battle took place every time that Beal found himself in Las Vegas. Phil Ivey "finished" the battle in early 2006. On February 5th, 2006, Beal dropped $3.3 million dollars to the "Corporation". He returned about a week later and went on a massive heater, beating the group of professionals out of $13.6 million dollars over four days. The "Corporation" decided to put their best player into the action, hoping to recoup at least some of their losses. Phil Ivey stepped into the game with the blinds at $30,000/$60,000. Eventually the blinds were increased to $50,000 / $100,000. When all was said and done, Ivey had single-handedly erased the $10 million dollar deficit and actually gained an extra $6.6 million for the "Corporation". All told, Andy Beal dropped $16.6 million dollars to Ivey over a three day period. This setback resulted in Beal leaving Las Vegas, claiming that he would never play poker again.
Ivey loves this kind of high stakes action. He is known to risk large amounts of money betting on sports. He loves to play high-stakes golf and he also loves to make high-stakes prop bets with his friends (one particular wager saw him bet Erick Lindgren $200k that Lindgren couldn't golf 72 holes in one day at Bear's Best, while walking the course, while playing in 100 degree weather, while shooting from the pro tees, while shooting less than 100 every round. Lindgren won the bet). Ivey just loves to gamble. He is reported to have won $70,000 from Andy Beal simply flipping coins. Ivey will bet on anything and everything.
According to those who know him, Phil Ivey is an "old-school" gambler who follows a certain code that some of the "new-school" gamblers might not follow. Doyle Brunson recently illustrated an example. After Chip Reese died, Phil Ivey called Doyle up and said that he had owed Reese a substantial sum of money, and was wondering who he should send it to. Brunson said that most people would have kept quiet about the debt and let Reese take knowledge of the debt to his grave - Ivey wanted to make good on the debt. It is this type of "code of ethics" that has always endeared Ivey to some of the "old-school" players such as Doyle Brunson.
Phil Ivey also has a number of friends outside of the poker world, including "Ja Rule" and "Irv Gotti". When Irv Gotti was on trial a while back, Phil Ivey flew out to New York to support his friend.
Ivey is also involved in numerous charities. After winning his first WPT title in February of 2008, Ivey donated $50,000 to Empowered 2 Excel, which is a Las Vegas based Christian Academy. He has also announced that he is forming the "Budding Ivey Foundation" which will give to various charitable causes.
Phil Ivey was one of the original members of "Team Full Tilt", and it is assumed that he has a sizable equity stake in the company. Considering that Full Tilt is likely worth north of $1 billion dollars, this would add substantially to Phil Ivey's net worth.
Exactly how much money does Ivey have? No one knows for sure except Phil Ivey and his accountant, but here are a couple of pieces of info that that you might find interesting:
-there was a proposal floated a few years back to have a $10 million dollar Sit and Go that would be televised on Fox Sports. This Sit and Go would be six-handed and require each player to put up $10 million dollars. Phil Ivey indicated at the time that he would put up the money and play
-Ivey was once playing at the Commerce Casino in LA and "forgot" that he had $750k in chips in his safe at the casino
With the "Big Game" fizzling out, many of the players who enjoyed playing in the game are now playing more tournament poker, including Barry Greenstein and Phil Ivey. If Ivey decides to spend his time focusing on tournament poker rather than cash games, it will only be a matter of time before he tops the all-time money list.
Phil Ivey is the most popular player in the game right now. He is idolized by younger players and respected by older players. He is a true gambler who has no fear and a seemingly limitless bankroll. One has to wonder how many bracelets and titles Phil Ivey will have once his career is done.
