=======================================================
Ronald Ernest "Ron" Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American physician, author, and former politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas' 14th and 22nd congressional districts. He represented the 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and from 1979 to 1985, and then represented the 14th congressional district, which included Galveston, from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve, the tax policy, the military–industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. Paul was the first chairman of the conservative PAC Citizens for a Sound Economy[2] and has been characterized as the "intellectual godfather" of the Tea Party movement.[3][4]
A native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Green Tree, Pennsylvania, Paul is a graduate of Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, where he earned his medical degree. He served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1968. He worked as an obstetrician-gynecologist from the 1960s to the 1980s, delivering more than 4,000 babies.[5] He became the first Representative in history to serve concurrently with a child in the Senate when his son, Rand Paul, was elected to the U.S. Senate from Kentucky in 2010.[6]
Paul is a Senior Fellow of the Mises Institute,[7] and has been an active writer, publishing on the topics of political and economic theory, as well as publicizing the ideas of economists of the Austrian School such as Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises during his political campaigns. Paul has written many books on Austrian economics and classical liberal philosophy, beginning with The Case for Gold (1982) and including A Foreign Policy of Freedom (2007), Pillars of Prosperity (2008), The Revolution: A Manifesto (2008), End the Fed (2009) and Liberty Defined (2011).
On July 12, 2011, Paul announced that he would forgo seeking another term in Congress in order to focus on his presidential bid.[8] On May 14, 2012, Paul announced that he would not be competing in any other presidential primaries but that he would still compete for delegates in states where the primary elections have already been held.[9] At the 2012 Republican National Convention, Paul received 190 delegate votes. In January 2013, Paul retired from Congress but still remains active on college campuses, giving speeches promoting his libertarian vision.[10][11]
Ronald Ernest Paul was born on August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh,[12] the son of Howard Caspar Paul, who ran a small dairy company, and Margaret Paul (née Dumont). His paternal grandfather emigrated from Germany,[13] and his paternal grandmother, a devout Christian, was a first-generation German American.[14]
As a junior at suburban Dormont High School, he was the 220-yard dash state champion.[15] He graduated from Gettysburg College with a B.S. degree in Biology in 1957.[15]
Paul earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University's School of Medicine in 1961, and completed his medical internship at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh.[16][17] Paul served as a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1965 and then in the United States Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. Paul and his wife then relocated to Texas, where he began a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology.[17]
While a medical resident in the 1960s, Paul was influenced by Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, which caused him to read other publications by Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand. He came to know economists Hans Sennholz and Murray Rothbard well, and credits to them his interest in the study of economics.[18]
When President Richard Nixon "closed the gold window" by ending American participation in the Bretton Woods System, thus ending the U.S. dollar's loose association with gold[18] on August 15, 1971, Paul decided to enter politics[19] and became a Republican candidate for the United States Congress.[20]
In 1974, incumbent Robert R. Casey defeated him for the 22nd district.[17] President Gerald Ford later appointed Casey to direct the Federal Maritime Commission, and Paul won an April 1976 special election to the vacant office after a runoff.[21][22][23] Paul lost the next regular election to Democrat Robert Gammage by fewer than 300 votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch, and was reelected in 1980 and 1982.[24][25][26] Gammage underestimated Paul's popularity among local mothers: "I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner."[27]
Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013.[28]
In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis.[13][29] Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue.[18] He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.[30]
During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics.[31][32] In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE),[2] a conservative political group founded by David H. Koch and Charles G. Koch "to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation." CSE founded the Tea Party movement in 2002,[33] but it did not catch on. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward.
Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives.[30] In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that "Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare.... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."[34][35] Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr.[36][37]
On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.[38]
Following the loss of the 1984 senate race, Paul returned to his obstetrics practice and took part in a number of other business ventures.[13][39] Along with his former congressional chief of staff, Lew Rockwell, Paul founded a for-profit enterprise, Ron Paul & Associates, Inc. (RP&A) in 1984, with Paul serving as president, Rockwell as vice president, Paul's wife Carol as secretary, and daughter Lori Pyeatt as treasurer. The company published a variety of political and investment-oriented newsletters, including Ron Paul Freedom Report and Ron Paul Survival Report, and by 1993 was generating revenues in excess of $900,000.[40][41]
Paul also co-owned a mail-order coin dealership, Ron Paul Coins, for twelve years with Burt Blumert, who continued to operate the dealership after Paul resumed office in 1996.[42][43] Paul spoke multiple times at the American Numismatic Association's 1988 convention.[42] He worked with his Foundation for Rational Economics and Education on such projects as establishing the National Endowment for Liberty, producing the At Issue public policy series that was broadcast on the Discovery Channel and CNBC,[31] and continuing publication of newsletters.
Paul resigned from the Republican Party in 1987 and launched a bid for the presidency running on the Libertarian Party ticket. His candidacy was seen as problematic because of the party's long support for freedom of choice on abortions. Native American activist Russell Means emphasized that he was pro-choice on the abortion issue.[44] In a forum held prior to the nomination, Means dismissed the greater funds raised by Paul's campaign, commenting that Means was receiving "10 times more press" than the former Congressman and was therefore "100 times more effective".[45]
In the 1988 presidential election, Paul was on the ballot in 46 States,[46] scoring third in the popular vote with 432,179 votes (0.5%).[47] Paul was kept off the ballot in Missouri, due to what the St. Louis Post-Dispatch termed a "technicality," and received votes there only when written in,[48] just as he did in North Carolina.[49]
According to Paul, his presidential campaign was about more than obtaining office; he sought to promote his libertarian ideas, often to school and university groups regardless of vote eligibility. He said, "We're just as interested in the future generation as this election. These kids will vote eventually, and maybe, just maybe, they'll go home and talk to their parents."[46]
Paul considered campaigning for President during 1992,[50] but instead chose to endorse Pat Buchanan that year, and served as an adviser to Buchanan's Republican presidential primary campaign against incumbent President George H. W. Bush.[51]
During 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after a difficult campaign. The Republican National Committee endorsed incumbent Greg Laughlin in the primary; Paul won with assistance from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend Nolan Ryan, tax activist and publisher Steve Forbes[13] and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (both of whom had had presidential campaigns that year). Paul narrowly defeated Democratic attorney Charles "Lefty" Morris in the fall election, despite Morris' criticism over controversial statements in several newsletters that Paul published.
In 1998 and 2000, Paul defeated Loy Sneary, a Democratic Bay City, Texas, rice farmer and former Matagorda County judge.[19] In the 2008 Republican primary,[52] he defeated Friendswood city councilman Chris Peden,[53] with over 70 percent of the vote[54] and ran unopposed in the general election.[55] In the 2010 Republican primary, Paul defeated three opponents with 80 percent of the vote.[56]
On July 12, 2011, Paul announced that he would not seek re-election to the House in order to pursue the 2012 presidential election.[57][58]
Of the 620 bills that Paul had sponsored through December 2011, over a period of more than 22 years in Congress, only one had been signed into law – a lifetime success rate of less than 0.3%.[59] The sole measure authored by Paul that was ultimately enacted allowed for a federal customhouse to be sold to a local historic preservation society (H.R. 2121 in 2009).[59]
By amending other legislation, he has helped prohibit funding for national identification numbers, funding for federal teacher certification,[19] International Criminal Court jurisdiction over the U.S. military, American participation with any U.N. global tax, and surveillance of peaceful First Amendment activities by citizens.[60]
Paul was honorary chairman of, and is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a political action committee that describes its goal as electing "liberty-minded, limited-government individuals".[61] He is an initiating member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, which deals with agricultural and rural issues, and the 140-member Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.[62]
With the election of the 112th Congress, and a resulting GOP majority in the House, Paul became the chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology starting in January 2011.[64]
Paul formally declared his candidacy for the 2008 Republican nomination on March 12, 2007, on C-SPAN.[65] Few major politicians endorsed him, and his campaign was largely ignored by traditional media.[66] However, he attracted an intensely loyal grassroots following, in large part energized by "iconoclastic white men"[67] interacting through internet social media.[68][69][70] In May 2007, shortly after the first televised primary debates, the blogs search engine site Technorati.com listed Paul's name as the term most frequently searched for;[68] and Paul's campaign claimed that Paul had more YouTube channel subscribers than Barack Obama or any other candidate for president.[71] For a candidate who had had relatively low national name recognition prior to entering the race, Paul did surprisingly well in fundraising, taking in more money than any other Republican candidate in the fourth quarter of 2007, as the primary season headed into the Iowa caucuses.[72][73]
Despite benefiting from large numbers of campaign contributions from individual donors,[74] and the efforts of tech-savvy supporters determined to keep his name a frequent topic of discussion on the internet,[68] over the course of the campaign Paul was unable to translate the enthusiasm of his core supporters into large enough numbers of actual primary votes to unseat his rivals.
Paul came in 5th place in both the January 4 Iowa caucuses (10% of votes cast)[75] and the January 8 New Hampshire primary (8%).[76] With the exception of the Nevada caucuses January 19, where he came in 2nd (14%) behind Romney (51%), he did little better through the rest of January: Michigan 4th (6%), South Carolina 5th (4%), Florida 5th (3%). On SuperTuesday, February 5, he placed 4th in almost every state, generally taking in a mere 3–6% of the votes although he did better in the northern states of North Dakota (21%, 3rd place) and Montana (25%, 2nd place).[77][78]
By March, front-runner John McCain had secured enough pledged delegates to guarantee that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, knew that it was now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20[79] – 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain.[80][81][82] Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention.[83][84][85] In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.[86][87]
On June 12, 2008, Paul finally withdrew his bid for the Republican nomination. He later said that one of the reasons he did not run in the general election as a third-party candidate, after losing the primaries, was that, as a concession to gain ballot access in certain states, he had signed legally binding agreements to not run a third-party campaign if he lost the primary.[88] Some of the $4 million remaining campaign contributions was invested into the new political action and advocacy group called Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty.[89]
At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul announced his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said that each of them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing either of the two main parties' candidates (McCain – Republican Party, or Obama – Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process.[90][91] Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.[92]
Two weeks later, "shocked and disappointed" that Bob Barr (the Libertarian nominee) had pulled out of attending the press conference at the last minute and had admonished Paul for remaining neutral and failing to say which specific candidate Paul would vote for in the general election, Paul released a statement saying that he had decided to endorse Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party candidate, for president.[93]
Paul withdrew from active campaigning in the last weeks of the primary election period. He received 42,426 votes, or 0.03% of the total cast, in the general election.[94]
He won several early straw polls for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination[95] and in late April, 2011, he formed an official exploratory committee.[96][97] He participated in the first Republican presidential debate on May 5, 2011.[98] and on May 13, 2011, Paul formally announced his candidacy in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America.[99] He placed second in the 2011 Ames Straw Poll, missing first by 0.9%.[100]
In December 2011, with Paul's increased support, the controversy over allegedly racist and homophobic statements in several Ron Paul newsletters in the 1980s and early 1990s once again gained media attention.[101] During this time Paul supporters asserted that he was continually ignored by the media despite his significant support, citing examples of where television news shows would fail to mention Paul in discussions of the Republican presidential hopefuls even when he was polling second.[102][103][104][105]
Paul came in third in the Iowa Republican Caucus held on January 3, 2012. Out of a turnout of 121,503 votes, Paul took 26,036 (21%) of the certified votes. Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney finished in a virtual tie for first place with 25% each.[106] In the New Hampshire Primary held on January 10, 2012, Paul received 23% of the votes and came in second after Romney's 39%.[107]
Paul's results then declined, despite the withdrawal of candidates Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman and Rick Perry. He had fourth place finishes in the next two primaries, on January 21 in South Carolina (with 13% of the vote[108]) and on January 31 in Florida (where he received 7% of the vote.[109][110][111])
On February 4, Paul finished third in Nevada with 18.8% of the vote.[112] Three non-binding primaries were held on February 7; Paul took 3rd place in Colorado[113] and Missouri[114] with 13% and 12% of the vote respectively. He fared better in Minnesota[115] with 27%, finishing second to Rick Santorum.
On May 14, Paul's campaign announced that due to lack of funds he would no longer actively campaign for votes in the 11 remaining primary states, including Texas and California, that had not yet voted.[9][116] He would, however, continue to seek to win delegates for the national party convention in the states that had already voted.
In June, a group of 132 supporters of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican party national convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Republican National Committee and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose Mitt Romney as the party’s presidential nominee.[117] The suit alleged that there had been “a systematic campaign of election fraud at state conventions,” employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in procedural rules, allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor Doug Wead had voiced support for the legal action.[117] Paul himself told CNN that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign’s strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, he was not going to tell his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. “If they’re not following the rules, you have a right to stand up for the rules. I think for the most part these winning caucuses that we've been involved in we have followed the rules. And the other side has at times not followed the rules.”[118]
Paul declined to speak at the Republican National Convention as a matter of principle, saying that the convention planners had demanded that his remarks be vetted by the Romney campaign and that he make an unqualified endorsement of Romney.[119] Paul had felt that "It wouldn’t be my speech.... That would undo everything I’ve done in the last 30 years. I don’t fully endorse him for president.”[119] Many of Paul's supporters and delegates walked out of the convention in protest over rules adopted by the convention that reduced their delegate count and that would make it harder for non-establishment candidates to win the party's nomination in future elections.[120] Supporters and media commentators had noted that the delegations from states where Paul had had the most support were given the worst seats in the convention hall, while delegations from regions with no electoral votes, such as the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico, were given prime seats at the front.[121][122]
As in 2008, in 2012 Paul ultimately refused to endorse the ticket selected by the Republican Party. He said that there was no essential difference between Romney and his Democratic opponent, President Obama, on the most critical policies: "I've been in this business a long time and believe me there is essentially no difference from one administration to another no matter what the platforms.... The foreign policy stays the same, the monetary policy stays the same, there’s no proposal for any real cuts and both parties support it."[123]
Paul did not actively campaign in the election; he received 26,204 write-in votes or 0.02% of the total cast.[124]
Throughout his entire tenure in Congress, Paul has represented his district as a member of the Republican Party. However, he has frequently taken positions in direct opposition to the other members and the leadership of the party, and he has sometimes publicly questioned whether he really belonged in the party.
Paul voted for Dwight Eisenhower for president in 1956 when he was 21 years old.[125] He had been a lifelong supporter of the Republican Party by the time he entered politics in the mid-1970s.[125] He was one of the first elected officials in the nation to support Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign,[126] and he actively campaigned for Reagan in 1976 and 1980.[127] After Reagan's election in 1980, Paul quickly became disillusioned with the Reagan administration's policies. He later recalled being the only Republican to vote against Reagan budget proposals in 1981,[128][129] aghast that "in 1977, Jimmy Carter proposed a budget with a $38 billion deficit, and every Republican in the House voted against it. In 1981, Reagan proposed a budget with a $45 billion deficit – which turned out to be $113 billion – and Republicans were cheering his great victory. They were living in a storybook land."[126] He expressed his disgust with the political culture of both major parties in a speech delivered in 1984 upon resigning from the House of Representatives to prepare for a (failed) run for the Senate, and he eventually apologized to his Libertarian friends for having supported Reagan.[128]
By 1987, Paul was ready to sever all ties to the Republican Party, as he explained in a blistering resignation letter: "Since [1981] Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party have given us skyrocketing deficits, and astoundingly a doubled national debt. How is it that the party of balanced budgets, with control of the White House and Senate, accumulated red ink greater than all previous administrations put together? ... There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force to reduce the size of government. That is the message of the Reagan years."[125][127] A month later he announced he would seek the 1988 Libertarian Party nomination for president.
During the 1988 campaign, Paul called Reagan "a dramatic failure"[127] and complained that "Reagan's record is disgraceful. He starts wars, breaks the law, supplies terrorists with guns made at taxpayers' expense and lies about it to the American people."[130] Paul predicted that "the Republicans are on their way out as a major party,"[128] and he said that, although registered as a Republican, he had always been a Libertarian at heart.[128][129]
Paul returned to his private medical practice and managing several business ventures after losing the 1988 election; but by 1996, he was ready to return to politics, this time running on the Republican Party ticket again. He said that he had never read the entire Libertarian platform when he ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988, and that "I worked for the Libertarians on my terms, not theirs."[131] He added that in terms of a political label he preferred to call himself "a constitutionalist. In Congress I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not the (Republican) platform."[131]
When he lost the Republican Party presidential primary election in 2008, Paul criticized the two major political parties, saying that there was no real difference between the parties and that neither of them truly intended to challenge the status quo. He refused to endorse the Republican Party's nominee for president, John McCain, and lent his support to third-party candidates instead.[132][133]
In 2012 presidential campaign, during which he acknowledged it was unlikely that he would win the Republican Party nomination,[134] Paul again asserted that he was participating in the Republican Party on his own terms, trying to persuade the rest of the party to move toward his positions rather than joining in with theirs.[135] He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, “If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don't want to change anything on foreign policy, they don't want to cut anything, they don't want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don't want to have actual change in government, that is a problem for me."[136] On that same theme he said in another interview, "I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that have given me trust and money that all of a sudden, I'd say, [all] we've done is for naught. So, let's support anybody at all ... even if they disagree with everything that we do."[137]
Paul at the 2007 National Right to Life Committee Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, June 15, 2007.
Paul has been described as conservative and libertarian.[13] According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002,[138][139] and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president,[140] on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economy – not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters.[141] Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives based on votes cast in 2010.[142][143]
The foundation of Paul's political philosophy is the conviction that "the proper role for government in America is to provide national defense, a court system for civil disputes, a criminal justice system for acts of force and fraud, and little else."[144] He has been nicknamed "Dr. No,"[19] reflecting both his medical degree and his insistence that he will "never vote for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution."[29]
Paul is a proponent of Austrian School economics; he has authored six books on the subject, and displays pictures of Austrian School economists Friedrich Hayek, Murray Rothbard, and Ludwig von Mises (as well as of President Grover Cleveland)[145] on his office wall. He regularly votes against almost all proposals for new government spending, initiatives, or taxes;[146] he cast two thirds of all the lone negative votes in the House during a 1995–1997 period.[19]
He has pledged never to raise taxes[147] and states he has never voted to approve a budget deficit. Paul believes that the country could abolish the individual income tax by scaling back federal spending to its fiscal year 2000 levels;[148][149] financing government operations would be primarily by excise taxes and non-protectionist tariffs. He endorses eliminating most federal government agencies, terming them unnecessary bureaucracies.
On April 15, 2011, Paul was one of four Republican members of Congress to vote against Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal, known as "The Path to Prosperity."[150]
Paul has consistently warned of hyperinflation as far back as 1981.[151] While Paul believes the longterm decrease of the U.S. dollar's purchasing power by inflation is attributable to its lack of any commodity backing, he does not endorse a "return" to a gold standard – as the U.S. government has established during the past – but instead prefers to eliminate legal tender laws and to remove the sales tax on gold and silver, so that the market may freely decide what type of monetary standard(s) there shall be.[152] Since 1999, he has introduced bills into each Congress seeking to eliminate the Federal Reserve System in a single year.[153][154][155]
Paul's foreign policy of nonintervention[156] made him the only 2008 Republican presidential candidate to have voted against the Iraq War Resolution in 2002. He advocates withdrawal from the United Nations, and from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for reasons of maintaining strong national sovereignty.[157]
He endorses free trade, rejecting membership in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization as "managed trade". He endorses increased border security and opposes welfare for illegal aliens, birthright citizenship and amnesty;[158] he voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006. He voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists in response to the September 11 attacks, but suggested war alternatives such as authorizing the president to grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal targeting specific terrorists. An opponent of the Iraq War and potential war with Iran, he has also criticized neoconservatism and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, arguing that both inadvertently cause terrorist reprisals against Americans, such as the 9/11 attacks. Paul has stated that "Israel is our close friend" and that it is not the place of the United States to "dictate how Israel runs her affairs".[159]
Paul endorses constitutional rights, such as the right to keep and bear arms, and habeas corpus for political detainees. He opposes the Patriot Act, federal use of torture, presidential autonomy, a national identification card, warrantless domestic surveillance, and the draft. Paul also believes that the notion of the separation of church and state is currently misused by the court system: "In case after case, the Supreme Court has used the infamous 'separation of church and state' metaphor to uphold court decisions that allow the federal government to intrude upon and deprive citizens of their religious liberty."[160]
Citing the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, Paul advocates states' rights to decide how to regulate social matters not cited directly by the Constitution. He opposes federal regulation of the death penalty[161] (although he opposes capital punishment),[162] of education,[163] and of marriage, and endorsed revising the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy to concern mainly disruptive sexual behavior (whether heterosexual or homosexual).[164]
He terms himself "strongly pro-life",[166] "an unshakable foe of abortion",[167] and believes regulation or ban[168] on medical decisions about maternal or fetal health is "best handled at the state level".[161][169] His abortion-related legislation, like the Sanctity of Life Act, is intended to negate Roe v. Wade and to get "the federal government completely out of the business of regulating state matters."[170]
Paul has stated that "The government shouldn't be in the medical business." He pushes to eliminate federal involvement with and management of health care, which he argues would allow prices to decrease due to the fundamental dynamics of a free market.[171] Paul also opposes the federal War on Drugs,[172] and believes the states should decide whether to regulate or deregulate drugs such as medical marijuana.[173] He also opposes federal government influenza inoculation programs.[174]
As a free-market environmentalist, he asserts private property rights in relation to environmental protection and pollution prevention.[175] He called global warming a hoax in a 2009 Fox Business interview, saying, "You know, the greatest hoax I think that has been around in many, many years if not hundreds of years has been this hoax on the environment and global warming."[176] He acknowledges there is clear evidence of rising temperatures in some parts of the globe, but says that temperatures are cooling in other parts.[177]
Paul was critical of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, arguing that it sanctioned federal interference in the labor market and did not improve race relations. He once remarked: "The Civil Rights Act of 1964 not only violated the Constitution and reduced individual liberty; it also failed to achieve its stated goals of promoting racial harmony and a color-blind society".[178] Paul opposes affirmative action.[179]
He is an outspoken proponent of increased ballot access for 3rd party candidates,[180] but has sought to repeal the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the Motor Voter law.[181]
Paul has stated that secession from the United States "is a deeply American principle" and that "If the possibility of secession is completely off the table there is nothing to stop the federal government from continuing to encroach on our liberties and no recourse for those who are sick and tired of it."[182] Paul wrote the remarks in a post on his Congressional website in one of his final public statements as a member of Congress, noting that many petitions had been submitted to the White House calling for secession in the wake of the November 2012 election.[183]
Sometime within the same month but much after the event of authorities executing a lock-down in sequence to the April 2013 Boston bombings, Paul commented on the tactics used by governing forces into a harsh criticism that he has written as a "military-style occupation of an American city".[11]

Beginning in 1978, for more than two decades Paul and his associates published a number of political and investment-oriented newsletters bearing his name (Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report, The Ron Paul Survival Report, the Ron Paul Investment Letter, and the Ron Paul Political Report).[184] By 1993, a business through which Paul was publishing the newsletters was earning in excess of $900,000 per year.[184]
A number of the newsletters, particularly in the period between 1988 and 1994 when Paul was no longer in Congress, contained material that later proved highly controversial, dwelling on conspiracy theories, praising anti-government militia movements, and warning of coming race wars.[184][185] During Paul's 1996 congressional election campaign, and his 2008 and 2012 presidential primary campaigns, critics charged that some of the passages reflected racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic bigotry.[19][186][187][188][189][190][191]
"...I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in [Washington, DC] are semi-criminal or entirely criminal."[186]
"Boy, it sure burns me to have a national holiday for that pro-communist philanderer, Martin Luther King. I voted against this outrage time and time again as a congressman. What an infamy that Ronald Reagan approved it! We can thank him for our annual Hate Whitey Day!" (February 1990: "The Coming Race War")[184]
"An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth [to defend yourself against armed robbery], you should leave the scene immediately, disposing of the wiped off gun as soon as possible... I frankly don't know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, I've urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. For the animals are coming." (October 1992: "Blast 'Em?")[184]
“I miss the closet. Homosexuals, not to speak of the rest of society, were far better off when social pressure forced them to hide their activities. They could also not be as promiscuous. Is it any coincidence that the AIDS epidemic developed after they came 'out of the closet,' and started hyper-promiscuous sodomy? I don't believe so, medically or morally.” (June 1990: "Newsletter")[192]
“[Magic] Johnson may be a sports star, but he is dying [of AIDS] because he violated moral laws.” (December 1991: "Mr. Johnson's Magic")[185]
“[T]he criminal ‘Justice’ Department wants to force dentists to treat these Darth Vader types [people with AIDS] under the vicious Americans With Disabilities Act;" and “[W]e all have the right to discriminate, which is what freedom of association is all about, especially against killers [AIDS patients].” (November 1993: "AIDSophilia")[185]
Other passages referred to former Secretary of Health & Human Services Donna Shalala as a “short lesbian” and Martin Luther King, Jr. as a pedophile and “lying socialist satyr" – while offering praise for former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke and other controversial figures.[184][185][192]
When criticism of the newsletters was leveled against Paul during his 1996 congressional election, he did not deny writing the newsletters, but instead defended them and said that the material had been taken out of context.[19][186][187] In later years, Paul said that the controversial material had been ghostwritten by members of a team that included 6 or 8 others and that, as publisher, not editor, he had not even been aware of the content of the controversial articles until years after they had been published.[19][193] He eventually disavowed those passages, and stated that in 1996 his campaign advisers had thought denying authorship would be too confusing and that he had to live with the material published under his name.[19][193] Some political commentators made note of the changing nature of the explanations he had provided over the years about his involvement with the newsletters.[194][195][196]
An estranged former long-term aide of Paul, Eric Dondero, alleged that Paul was lying about his role in the production of the controversial newsletters.[197][198] During the 2012 Republican presidential primary campaign, in January 2012, the Washington Post reported[199] that several of Paul's former associates said that Paul had been very involved in the production of the newsletters and had allowed the controversial material to be included as part of a deliberate strategy to boost profits. Paul's former secretary said, "It was his newsletter, and it was under his name, so he always got to see the final product... He would proof it."[199] Paul continued to deny the accusations and to disavow the material.[200]
In January 2013, a group of grassroots supporters offered the RonPaul.org domain to Paul, after hearing that Paul regretted not owning the site, and also offered the mailing list of (but not the domain name) RonPaul.com, for $250,000.[201] In February, Paul filed a complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization, a UN organization he has called to be disbanded, asking the agency to confiscate the domain names RonPaul.com and RonPaul.org from the group.[202] In May, WIPO rejected Paul's complaint[203] and declared him guilty of reverse domain hijacking[204] for filing a frivolous complaint against the group.[205][206]
In April 2013, Paul founded the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, a foreign policy think tank that seeks to promote his non-interventionist views.[207] The institute is part of his larger foundation Foundation for Rational Economics and Education.
In the same month, he began to offer the Ron Paul Curriculum, a homeschool online curriculum developed by Gary North and taught from a "free market and Christian" perspective; it is free from grades K-5 and available to paid members from 6-12.[208]
In June 2013, Paul criticized the NSA surveillance program and praised Edward Snowden for having performed a "great service to the American people by exposing the truth about what our government is doing in secret".[209]
In 2013, Paul established the "Ron Paul Channel", an Internet broadcast. Its slogan is "Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth."[210] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, "I was at a debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution."[211]

Paul has been married to Carol (Carolyn) Wells since 1957.[212] They met in 1952 when Wells asked Paul to be her escort to her 16th birthday party.[213][214] They have five children, who were baptized Episcopalian:[13] Ronald, Lori, Randal, Robert, and Joy. Paul's son Randal is the junior United States senator from the state of Kentucky. Raised a Lutheran, Paul later became a Baptist.[215] Since 1995, Carol Paul has published the Ron Paul Family Cookbook, a collection of recipes she and her friends contributed, and which was sold in part to support Ron Paul's political campaigns.[216]

Ron Paul is the leading advocate for freedom in our nation’s capital. As a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Dr. Paul tirelessly works for limited, constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies. He is known among his congressional colleagues and his constituents for his consistent voting record. Dr. Paul never voted for legislation unless the proposed measure was expressly authorized by the Constitution. In the words of former Treasury Secretary William Simon, Dr. Paul is the “one exception to the Gang of 535″ on Capitol Hill.
Ron Paul was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, before proudly serving as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force during the 1960s. He and his wife Carol moved to Texas in 1968, where he began his medical practice in Brazoria County. As a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology, Dr. Paul has delivered more than 4,000 babies. He and Carol, who reside in Lake Jackson, Texas, are the proud parents of five children and have 17 grandchildren.
While serving in Congress during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dr. Paul’s limited-government ideals were not popular in Washington. In 1976, he was one of only four Republican congressmen to endorse Ronald Reagan for president.
During that time, Congressman Paul served on the House Banking committee, where he was a strong advocate for sound monetary policy and an outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve’s inflationary measures. He was an unwavering advocate of pro-life and pro-family values. Dr. Paul consistently voted to lower or abolish federal taxes, spending and regulation, and used his House seat to actively promote the return of government to its proper constitutional levels. In 1984, he voluntarily relinquished his House seat and returned to his medical practice.
Dr. Paul returned to Congress in 1997 to represent the 14th congressional district of Texas. He served on the House Committee on Financial Services and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. After retiring from Congress in early 2013, Ron Paul continues to advocate a dramatic reduction in the size of the federal government and a return to constitutional principles.
Ron Paul’s consistent voting record prompted one of his congressional colleagues to say, “Ron Paul personifies the Founding Fathers’ ideal of the citizen-statesman. He makes it clear that his principles will never be compromised, and they never are.” Another colleague observed, “There are few people in public life who, through thick and thin, rain or shine, stick to their principles. Ron Paul is one of those few.”

I just plain like getting back to the basics. A few generations ago you could be a janitor and provide for your family. Every American needs a safe place to live a little money in the bank and to be able to retire and enjoy the fruits of his or her labor with their family. Like the old days, like my grandfather he never worried about healthcare or insurance. 
These are truly great ideas in on the topic of blogging. You have touched some fastidious points here.
I’m only 13 and can’t vote but I honestly believe all his ideas are fair to him, congress, and the population. Ron Paul 2016.

Dr. Paul, you have peaked my interest. You don’t come off as neither devilcrat nor repulsivecan! I will read up more on you and your position.
I not going to vote for a Satanic person who think children elderly and disable who make up over 87% should work or not receive food water or heath care
We need more people like Ron Paul, he understands the true values of what freedom is all about. I unfortunately did the dumbest mistake of my life and had a substantial amount of Cannabis along with Paraphernalia in my possession. I don’t know what will happen to my future anymore. I am a 4.0 student and do not fit the stereotype description of the so called “lazy-unmotivated stoners.” Being only 20 years old and the way Texas is so harsh on Cannabis I might move out once I “pay” for my mistake. I am all for legalizing and regulating the use of Cannabis, I do not blame it one bit everyone knows prohibition is to blame. I have worked so hard throughout the years for a harmless plant being the reason I don’t get a certain career job. Thank you Ron Paul cause I know you mean well I wish there were more people like you, I really do.
WHAT THE HELL IS EVERYONES PROBLEM? WHY ISN’T HE PRESIDENT? WHERE IS HE? SOMEONE NEEDS TO STAND UP SAY SOMETHING… DO SOMETHING. please please please  
I am all for smaller govt…. And am intrigued by the idea of cutting back to the basic constitution…
I don’t have a lot of political knowledge, but after becoming a mother I starting taking a lot of interest in my rights and the governments roll in my life. I first voted in 2008 for Obama. I felt that the change he was talking about would actually happen. As disappointed as I was with his first term, I did vote for him again, but this time only because I had a huge dislike for Romney. I watched all of the debates that you took part in, and I was so intrigued with your message and what you would do if you were President. I sure hope that you have success leading up to 2016. I will definitely give you my vote when that day comes. We need more people who live by the constitution without trying to work around the loopholes. We need more people that understand the people need our jobs back and they shouldn’t be sent over seas. We need more Americans not republican/democrats separating our nation. We need more farmers without the GMO shit. I am personally appalled by how involved our government has become and how the mass media only shows what they want us to hear. We are being dumbed down by our own country. What would we do if we didn’t have keeping up with the kardashians? It’s just sad. There’s a lack of valuable information provided to the people. I hope the people wake up. You have my support and I look forward to your 2016 presidential race.
To Pam…..You should be paying more attention to what is going on with our Government rather than watching the Kardashians.  This is what is wrong with this Country, people not educating themselves on the issues and getting bamboozled by the same old same old politicians who care nothing about us.
HOWEVER – your comments regarding the Boston Marathon bombing were completely OUT Of LINE, and show a compete lack of knowledge about this unfortunate incident .Did you not hear the cheering  and see the total public support for the police action ? Such  politically motivated and  attention grabbing comments, undo a lot of the good work you do ,and are a reason that you remain forever politically marginalized .Please “wake up ” Ron Paul
I see this as a foolish statement Mr. Douglas. With due respect, I’m not sure that you are qualified to berate a hero such as Dr. Paul, because I saw the people who cheered on the news, but I also saw many individuals being interviewed who were angry that the cops had terrorized them in their homes.  You just must not have seen EVERYTHING there was to see.  So perhaps you could be the one who is wrong.   You’re not helping the cause who always works to help YOU.   In fact it is you, sir, you are the reason that Ron Paul has been marginalized for this long.  This type of thing ALWAYS fools people.  It’s obviously easy to do as you now see.
Let us not waste our time about ifs and buts, but rather focus on the issues this powerful group of Patriots can accomplish, or assist in getting done since Ron did not get elected.
Calling any and all Patriots of good-will to assist fight against ongoing infringements on our Constitutional rights and protections, rule of law, due process etc., regarding federal oversight and mandates to protect our citizens from wrongful foreclosure and comply with the Protecting Homeowners/Tenants at Foreclosure Act. 
Especially in Georgia, which is 6th highest in foreclosures, 6th most impoverished state, and 6th highest for no protection or assistance for its citizens. 
FNMA, bailed out and now bought out with our taxes continues to abuse fed mandates, law and its own written policies. Their servicers and leasing companies force people into foreclosure and then do not allow them to be priority buyer or provide the term of lease according to law.
Even if you can only direct me and others in who to contact. I have tried any state agency that should be able and have the obligation to help. That includes agencies up to the atty. general, which referred me to the DOJ; still nothing.
I regret I voted for Obama now! Had I did my homework on Ron Paul he would of gotten my vote!! I agree with Ron and his views.  So many don’t like him because he speaks TRUTH! and well those who are lost will not agree with him and Yes Government is not what it is intended to be from beginning but if people don’t get their lazy butts up and do something we will soon become a Dicated nation.  To those people who love their government you all better get use to being dicated to.

Ronald Reagan: "Ron Paul is one of the outstanding leaders fighting for a stronger national defense. As a former Air Force officer, he knows well the needs of our armed forces, and he always puts them first. We need to keep him fighting for our country."
Ron Paul is a proud Air Force veteran. He served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1965 and then in the U.S. Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. During his military service Ron Paul spent time on the ground in Iran, Pakistan, South Korea, Turkey, Ethiopia and other countries.
Ron Paul is very popular with the military. He receives more donations from active duty military personnel than all other Republican candidates combined.
Ron Paul has been married to his wife Carol Wells since 1957. They have five children: Ronald, Lori, Rand, Robert, and Joy. Paul's son Rand is the junior senator from the state of Kentucky.

Ron PaulU.S. RepresentativeBorn: 20 August 1935Birthplace: Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaBest known as: Famously conservative Texas Congressman, 1997-2013Ron Paul was a U.S. Congressman from the 14th district of Texas from 1997 to 2013. Paul was a staunch advocate of limited government; his official biography described his platform as "limited constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies," and said Paul "never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution." (This voting record earned him the nickname "Dr. No.") Paul earned a degree from Gettysburg College in 1957, then a medical degree from Duke University in 1961. He was drafted into the U.S. Air Force and became a flight surgeon from 1965-67, then settled in Texas as a doctor specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. He first served as a congressman from Texas's 22nd district in 1976-77, winning a special election in April of 1976 but then losing in the general election that November. He was elected again in 1978 and served until 1985, when he returned to his medical practice after losing in a 1984 run for U.S. Senate. He was the Libertarian Party candidate for U.S. president in 1988, his views having already put him at the far right wing of the Republican party. (Paul received 0.5% of the vote in the general election, which was won by George Bush the elder.) Paul was re-elected to Congress from a different Texas district, the 14th, in 1996 and was re-elected seven more times from 1998 through 2010. He ran for the Republican nomination for president in 2008, but ended his campaign in June 2008 after John McCain wrapped up the nomination. He launched another failed run for the U.S. presidency in 2012, becoming the oldest member of a crowded Republican field.Extra credit: The 14th District is a Gulf Coast region in and around the city of Galveston... Paul's campaign bio says he has delivered more than 4000 babies in his career... He married the former Carol Wells in 1957...

• His grandfather immigrated from Germany at the age of 14 and 6 months later his father died, leaving him alone in a strange country.
• Paul’s grandfather became a truck farmer in Pennsylvania and eventually started a successful dairy farm.  He had 4 sons and 1 daughter.  His second son, Howard, was Ron Paul’s father.  
Here’s a question for you: Is the 76 year old, 12-term Republican member of Congress a politician or is he a writer? That’s easy, you say. 
What if we told you that Ron Paul is arguably the most prodigious writer among any elected official in recent history? While he has a while yet to go before matching former president Jimmy Carter’s 23 titles, the former obstetrician has an incredible body of work that has been, and continues to be published in numerous publications, be it for the FREE Foundation and Mises Institute, or his medical, law, economic and political articles, and not forgetting of course, his personal favorite, civil liberties.
His most recent bestseller, The Revolution: A Manifesto, brings a new perspective to Paul’s eternal advocacy of individual rights, a non-interventionist foreign policy, judicial activism and the supremacy of the constitution; all the while espousing a radicalism in approach towards achieving his Utopian Republican model, which parallels classical republicanism, a concept that incorporates the ideals of civic virtues built upon a mixed constitution. 
Another bestseller, End The Fed, which was released just eight days before The Revolution, sees Paul laying a damning verdict on the Federal Reserve, labeling it as irresponsible and corrupt, and going as far as insinuating that the Federal Reserve Act is ‘harmful’ to the nation. It is interesting to note that barely seven months earlier, with almost no notable press coverage to speak of, Paul introduced to Congress the bill H.R. 833: Federal Reserve Board Abolition Act, which failed to pass the House Committee on Financial Services.
Paul’s next book, Liberty Defined: 50 Essential Issues That Affect Our Freedom, is scheduled for an April release. It promises an in-depth look into the issues of personal rights and liberty and promises to be yet another bestseller for the Congressman.
• He became an obstetrician and gynecologist, delivering over 4,000 babies to date.  He opened his own practice in Texas.
• He decided to enter politics in 1971 when President Nixon closed the “gold window” and Paul realized that all money would be political rather than having real value.
• He became a delegate to the Texas Republican Convention and the Republican candidate for US congress but was defeated in 1974.
• He won a special election to fill that seat in 1976 when Congressman Robert Casey was given a presidential appointment but lost it in the general election by less than 0.2%.
• He won the seat again in 1978 and was re-elected in ‘80 and ’82 while continuing to deliver babies.  After an unsuccessful 1984 run for the senate he returned to medical practice full time.
• Ron Paul ran for president in 1988 as a Libertarian, more to spread the libertarian ideas than to actually win the office, then returned to his medical practice and co-owned a coin dealership.
• He won a congressional seat in 1996, his third win as a non-incumbent.  He was re-elected in 1998 and 2000.
• Paul ran for president again in 2008 and lost out early in the process.  He won his 12th term in Congress in 2010 with 80% of the vote. 
• He helped with the family’s dairy business as a child.  His very first paying job was inspecting milk bottles loaded onto the conveyer belt by his uncle.  He earned a penny for every dirty milk bottle he found.
• Ron Paul also had a paper route, mowed lawns and worked in the local drug store.  He saved those earnings and used them be begin his college education.  He also earned money as a part time painter and furniture mover. 
• He and his five brothers all shared one bedroom.  His siblings agree that he was an even-tempered but very stubborn young boy.
• Joy is married with four children and is expecting her fifth with husband Andy.  She, like her father, is an obstetrician and gynecologist.
• Randall (Rand) is the only child that does not live in Texas.  He is married and has three sons.  Rand is an ophthalmologist who lives in Kentucky and was just elected to Congress in 2010. 
• Ron Paul attended Dormont High School, where he was on the wrestling team and was president of the student council.
• He was the 220 yard dash state champion.  He was offered a college scholarship for track but rejected it because he had injured his knee, needed surgery and didn’t think he could live up to expectations.
• Paul was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity at Gettysburg College where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in biology in 1957.
• Ron Paul’s parents were Howard Paul and Margaret (Dumont) Paul.  Howard ran the dairy farm and Margaret kept the books.
