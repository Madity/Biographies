      Has been in a relationship with Romain Dauriac since November 2012 and they have been engaged since August 2013.
      I'm so tired of hearing casting directors ask if I have a sore throat. The people who have told me that my voice is distinctive, it's unusual... those people have always been close to my heart.
      [commenting of why she was glad that Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003) was a small foreign production] It would be hellish to have the pressure of putting on a Hollywood ending or putting in a scene where Vermeer sees Griet washing her breasts.
      I have a lot of actor friends who worked with their parents closely and have had really horrible experiences. They end up suing or being emancipated. The wonderful thing about my mom [who is also her manager] is that she completely respects my creative weirdness and supports any decision I make.
      As long as people keep buying tabloids, they'll keep harassing people in the public eye. They'll make up stories.
      On David Hasselhoff, after they had both worked on The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004): I so fancied him when I was young, that to see my name on the credits next to his makes me go all girly. He was a hunk back in those days.
      I have an obsessive character. I manicure my nails at three in the morning because nobody else can do it the right way. Maybe that's the secret to my success.
      It's a great thing to get older and learn. I don't feel bound in any way by how many years I've lived. I identify just as much with my 86-year-old grandmother as I do with my sister.
      People forget what it's like to be a child. When you're a child actress, people sometimes regress into being obnoxious and patronizing. But there's no reason to dumb things down just because you're working with kids.
      What I respect most in people is naturalness and authenticity. I like to be able to see into their soul. I aspire to being a truthful person.
      The most precious moment in life is when you're about to fall in love. You're lying in bed together and he's gazing at you and you're gazing at him and there's a sense that something truly wondrous is about to happen. It's a nervous moment - but it's exhilarating.
      I don't talk about my personal relationships, it always ends up kicking you in the face. But I've read a lot of things about myself and think, "Wow! That girl sounds really saucy.".
      I think that I sort of see other actresses are kind of proud of the way they look and show it off. That's never really been my style. I really don't think that it's disgusting or wrong, if you're 18 you're 18, it's your body, it's your right to show yourself, however, I don't really take a part in that. I like to look nice, but I think that there's ways of doing it that are more tasteful than just wearing a bikini wherever you go.
      I don't know if I've got swept up. It's so shocking when you hear that Calvin Klein wants you for their new campaign. You're like, 'who me?'. I guess you have to decide where you draw the line between you saying, this is fun, pretty and fabulous, and being over-exposed.
      Well, you put a little piece of yourself into every character that you do. Even if you're playing some psychotic person, which of course I'm not, some part of you is in that character and it's hopefully believable. I always come back to the fact that my own instinct is better than something I build in my mind.
      Tons of that stuff comes to me, but a lot of it is awful. All these teenage slaying movies, and movies about girls that have deformities that become cheerleaders and then marry the prom king!
      I always had the chance to do whatever I wanted to do, my parents were very open about that. Acting has been a passion of mine. I wanted to be in musicals as a kid, and took tap dance, so for me it's a dream come true, my childhood was filled with things that I loved to do, and also very normal things: I lived in New York, I have a family life and went to a regular school. If anything, I look back and think, "Wow, I did a lot of things that a lot of people don't get to do in their lifetime.".
      It's a place of solace. I love London, it's an amazing city. I've met some wonderful people there and I also have some family there. I'm from New York, so I feel very at home in London. It's like a metropolitan breeding ground for culture, art, music and diversity. It's a beautiful city, with beautiful history. In Hollywood, it's hard to step outside of the circle once you're in it. But in London I was really moved by how accepted I felt there. There was definitely less need to wear my big sunglasses!
      [on filming The Island (2005)] I came home and I thought I was going to die. I was in agony. I had muscles that had atrophied. I couldn't run any longer and it was only the first day. But, actually, Ewan was in the same boat. He had black and blue marks all over him. So, it wasn't so bad since someone else was in agony.
      I don't think there's any kind of preparation for sudden celebrity. I think you almost have this slight nervous breakdown when that kind of media attention happens. I mean, you're doing the same kind of thing that you do all the time, only you have to make these weird adjustments. Like, you're buying a slice of pizza and somebody's outside photographing you which is weird - that's not normal! It's very uncomfortable.
      Everyone in Hollywood is so damn skinny and you constantly feel like you're not skinny enough. But I have 'fat days' and I accept that I'm never going to be rail thin. It's hard not to feel pressure in this industry and I already use anti-aging products on my skin. I try not to let the pressure get to me but Los Angeles is a very hard place to be unless you have people here that love you. It can be very, very lonely, and it can eat you up if you don't take care of yourself.
      I was driving through Los Angeles and I look up and see the biggest photo of me I have ever seen in my life on a massive ad space. I screamed and slammed on the brakes. I couldn't believe it. It's very strange to see my cleavage the size of a brontosaurus. My breasts were huge. I had long hair and my goodness, I couldn't get past the cleavage.
      I don't think human beings are monogamous by nature. It's difficult - you have to put a lot of effort into a relationship. I think it's hard for actors to date each other because they are so damn moody. You are away from people constantly and having a relationship that is strictly by phone, it is miserable. Or if you say to him/her, "Hey, (even though) I am doing a very sexy scene with this very sexy girl/boy, I love you and I'm going to be thinking of you when I am rolling around in bed with this person!".
      We are supposed to be liberated in America but if our President had his way, we wouldn't be educated about sex at all. Every woman would have six children and we wouldn't be able to have abortions.
      Whose life would I like to step into for the day? The president's. I could probably get some things done in the Oval Office.
      Do I ever get nervous about this, right now, being the pinnacle of my career? Yeah, I do. At the end of (filming) every movie I think, "Wow - this is the last one! Nice working with you.".
      I'm curvy - I'm never going to be 5' 11' and 120 pounds. But I feel lucky to have what I've got.
      [on Woody Allen] I just adore Woody. We have a lot in common. We're New Yorkers, Jewish. We have a very easygoing relationship.
      [About getting to entertain US troops in the Persian Gulf in 2008] This USO tour to the Gulf region truly means a lot. I've wanted to go over and visit for some time, and now my moment has arrived. It's one thing to reply to a letter or extend your thanks to service members in a speech, but it's another thing to visit them and spend time with those that do so much for us back home.
      [on comparisons with Marilyn Monroe] I love Marilyn. I think she was incredibly beautiful and a very underrated actress. I am a curvy woman who is blonde, and perhaps we are both comfortable in our femininity, but I think that is as far as the comparison goes.
      My natural hair color is dirty blonde. I've been a bottle blonde before, very yellow - and a white blonde. My dad is Danish and he's a natural blonde. I've even taken a clipping from his hair to the salon so I can have it tinted the same color!
      [on Katy Perry's song, "I Kissed a Girl", which was inspired by Scarlett Johansson] That's flattering, but my lips are kind of taken.
      [on her trip to Rwanda and initiative to help fight against AIDS in Africa] It was important for me to come here and see the issues we're up against firsthand. I came here with an open mind, wanting to listen, understand and learn; I leave with the overwhelming understanding that the small action of making a (RED) choice in your purchases ... has an enormous impact on the lives of people in countries like Rwanda.
      There was this rumor mill cranking out stories that I had lost 14 pounds -- I could never lose 14 pounds. I can't look at somebody who is 6 feet tall and 120 pounds and say, I'm going to get that body. That's just never going to happen. You have to work with what you've got.
      [on her marriage to Ryan Reynolds] I never really thought about getting married - it just kind of happened. It seemed natural, the right thing to do. It was kind of a celebration of the time... I'm kind of making my own little family now, which is funny. It's like a little bit of a tribe. You hope that a relationship makes you better, that you learn things about yourself.
      I would love to work on Broadway, but I don't know that it would manifest itself in musical theater... I have terrible stage fright that I'd have to get over. It came on when I was a teenager, and I think it somehow sticks with you.
      I love to get ready for the red carpet, but being on it is very uncomfortable. It's so freakish and weird. I get flop sweats, dry mouth, heart palpitations, all-over panic!
      I try to stay fit and eat healthily, but I am not anxious to starve myself and become unnaturally thin. I don't find that look attractive on women and I don't want to become part of that trend. It's unhealthy and it puts too much pressure on women in general who are being fed this image of the ideal, which it is not. I think America has become obsessed with dieting rather than focusing on eating well, exercising and living a healthy life. I also think that being ultra-thin is not sexy at all. Women shouldn't be forced to conform to unrealistic and unhealthy body images that the media promote. I don't need to be skinny to be sexy.
      [on winning a Tony Award] Being welcomed into this community has been a dream come true for me. Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to be on Broadway, and here I am.
      [on working on Broadway] It was strange to think that this show is going to go on whether it's good or bad. They will let the audience in at some point, and they will see it, and we are going to be exposed for better or for worse.
      [on how she spends her free time] I'm still trying to figure out what to do when I'm not making movies. I just don't do that many things.
      (on being the face of Moet & Chandon Champagne) I am honored to have been chosen as their ambassador and to make history with the brand, as the first celebrity face of champagne.
      [on her 2011 photo shoot for Mango clothing] Yes, it has been great working with Mango. I loved working with the whole team - I think between Mario, the makeup and hairdressing teams and the stylist, we have created something special.
      Sharing food is one of life's pleasures. On a global scale, we don't share fairly. Close to a billion people go to bed hungry every night. The fact is: the global food system is a broken one. All of us, from Kentucky to Kenya, deserve enough to eat. That's why I'm joining Oxfam's Grow campaign.
      I feel comfortable as a young woman - a young, modern, liberal person. I feel comfortable with my sexuality. However, I am protective of my private life. I don't think that if you are in the public eye your life is public. I am an actor. But you can't take things too seriously.
      I don't feel mature. I always feel about the age I am. I know Robert Redford described me as, '13 going on 30', but that's not how I felt at the time. I am still dorky. I watch cheesy TV with TV dinners and, at one point, could not stop watching Jerry Springer.
      I started acting when I was seven. I had a couple of lines in this play called "Sophistry" with Ethan Hawke. I studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute, and that really gave me an opportunity to perform before live audiences. There's absolutely a difference between that and working in film... like you can mess up in film and not worry about it.
      [on the alleged nude photos of her which were stolen by hackers] Just because you're in the spotlight, or just because you're an actor or making films or whatever, doesn't mean that you're not entitled to your own personal privacy. I think no matter what the context, if that is besieged in some way, it feels unjust. It feels wrong.
      [on her divorce in 2011] At first I was quite depressed. After about a week or so I pulled myself together and started to go to the gym all the time. Luckily I've got a few very close girlfriends who have been by my side for 15 years now, whom I can talk to about everything and confide in. I have a close relationship with my twin brother Hunter as well. And then there's my grandmother Dorothy. She's an incredibly sweet, lovely and wise woman.
      I don't have a Facebook or a Twitter account, and I don't know how I feel about this idea of, "Now, I'm eating dinner, and I want everyone to know that I'm having dinner at this time," or "I just mailed a letter and dropped off my kids." That, to me, is a very strange phenomenon. I can't think of anything I'd rather do less than have to continuously share details of my everyday life. I guess they [celebrities] use it in a way that works for them. But I'd rather that people had less access to my personal life. If I could keep it that way, I'd be a happy lady.
      There's a lot of things that I want to pursue and hopefully, eventually will when all of this falls apart. I work with a lot of nongovernmental organizations. I don't know if I'd want to start my own, but I think I'd dedicate more of my time to that. It'd also be nice to have a vineyard somewhere, an organic farm or something like that. That's like a hippie-dippy wish - but a really good one.
      One of the most exciting thing about The Avengers (2012), is that in my opening scene the first thing you see is my character getting punched in the face. Everybody's like, "Damn, it's nice to see a girl get the shit kicked out of her.".
      Unfortunately, my generation had a shitty time. Horrible bubblegum pop boy bands and rap metal. It just wasn't my scene. There was some good hip hop, though, like Fugees.
      When I was 13, I loved Radiohead's The Bends and I loved Nine Inch Nails. When I graduated to a CD player, I'd listen to a lot of old Depeche Mode and New Order, actually. I'd start rummaging through what my older brother had and discover all this weird progressive new wave music that he'd been listening to 10 years prior.
      The first time I had a really private experience with an album was when I was 10 and somebody gave me an Abbey Road cassette tape as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I knew that goddamn tape backwards and forwards. I had one of those Walkmans that you didn't have to flip over. It had auto reverse and would just play over and over.
      I wanted to be Frank Sinatra and sing like him. He's got a voice like gold bullion. His voice is like velvet cake. I loved all the Vegas stuff, but I liked the polka dot and moonbeams stuff best. Early Frank, when he was just "Frankie", a whisper of what he would someday be. I was a ham as a kid. I loved musical theater, so from a young age, I admired how show-stopping Sinatra was.
      One of my favorite Waits (Tom Waits) songs is "Burma Shave". We tried to do that... and couldn't. I asked myself, "What is the essence of this song?" and I realized that I couldn't do it because it's Tom. Tom is the essence.
      A song like "Who You Are" is such a personal thing for Tom Waits. I can't even pretend to imagine what it was born out of. I would never try to interpret somebody else's emotion. I can only read the lyrics and associate them with my own life experience. I had to sing them from my own gut. The same way you would take somebody's written dialogue and breathe your own life into it. I have the perspective that I have and I can only work through that.
      I grew up in a household that was very politically conscious... it was just understood that it was important, that it was our responsibility.
      My brother was totally geeked-out by Katie Couric. I think he followed her around the entire night. I was chasing after him, and I turned around, and I had a bunch of Republican senators chasing after me.
      I think I understand my emotional state and my complexities now in a much clearer way, and I can put them to rest in a way that there's almost a catharsis that happens through the work, where I can do it and then find myself again.
      [on being thought of as sex symbol] Are you asking me if I feel objectified? I think that, sure, I've been a 'victim' of that, if you want to call it that, but only as much as anyone else. I don't feel particularly singled out more than any other person. All you have to do is go to a nightclub to see that happening every day. A man is not always trying to undress a woman's brain first.
      [on varying the roles she accepts] It would be such a waste to just continue to do the same thing and not take a risk. I don't have anything to lose, really. Even if it doesn't work out out, the gain if it does is so much greater. Taking those risks is something I feel more and more comfortable with.
      I just didn't think that I would be able to stay in that kind of twisted frenzy that a lot of actors feel they need in order to work.
      There are plenty of moments on stage where you think, "If one of my boobs just fell out right now..."
      I was always terrible at commercials because my voice was so deep. At the age of 9, I sounded like a whiskey-drinking, chain-smoking fool.
      With Her (2013), it was about finding the shape of things and building this character that's almost a babe - but just fresh out of the package in every way.
Jonathan Glazer is such a sensitive, engaged, funny person. But then you see the film and you're like, "Jesus, is that what's in his mind all the time?"

Scarlett Johansson (/dʒoʊˈhænsən/ joh-HAN-sən; born November 22, 1984)[1] is an American actress, model, and singer. She made her film debut in North (1994) and was later nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead for her performance in Manny & Lo (1996), garnering further acclaim and prominence with roles in The Horse Whisperer (1998) and Ghost World (2001).

Roles in A Love Song for Bobby Long (2004) and Woody Allen's Match Point (2005) earned Johansson two more Golden Globe Award nominations. Her subsequent films included The Island (2005), The Black Dahlia (2006), The Prestige (2006), The Other Boleyn Girl (2008), Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) and He's Just Not That Into You (2009). She has played the Marvel comic book character Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and is set to reprise the role in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).[2] Johansson's roles in Don Jon (2013) and Under the Skin (2014) received critical acclaim and she won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in the 2010 Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge. As a singer, Johansson has released two albums, Anywhere I Lay My Head and Break Up.
Johansson is considered one of Hollywood's modern sex symbols, and has frequently appeared in published lists of the sexiest women in the world, most notably when she was named the "Sexiest Woman Alive" by Esquire magazine in both 2006 and 2013 (the only woman to be chosen for the title twice),[3][4][5] and the "Sexiest Celebrity" by Playboy magazine in 2007.[6]
Scarlett Johansson was born in New York City.[7] Her father, Karsten Johansson, is a Danish-born architect originally from Copenhagen,[8] and her paternal grandfather, Ejner Johansson, was a screenwriter and director. Her mother, Melanie Sloan, a producer, comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family from the Bronx.[9][10][11] Sloan's ancestors emigrated to New York from Minsk, Russian Empire.[12] She has an older sister, Vanessa, also an actress; an older brother, Adrian; a twin brother, Hunter (who appeared with her in the film Manny & Lo);[13][14] and an older half-brother, Christian, from her father's first marriage.[15]
Johansson grew up in a household with "little money",[16] and with a mother who was a "film buff".[17] She and her twin brother attended P.S. 41 in the upper-middle-class Greenwich Village neighborhood, in Manhattan, for elementary school.[18] Johansson began her theatrical training by attending and graduating from Professional Children's School in Manhattan in 2002.[19]
Johansson began acting during childhood, after her mother started taking her to auditions. She would audition for commercials but took rejection so hard her mother began limiting her to film tryouts.[20] She made her film debut at the age of 9, as John Ritter's daughter in the 1994 fantasy comedy, North.[7] Following minor roles in the 1995 film Just Cause, as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw, and If Lucy Fell in 1996, she played the role of Amanda in Manny & Lo (1996). Her performance in Manny & Lo garnered a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female,[7] and positive reviews, one noting, "[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson",[21] while San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick LaSalle commentated on her "peaceful aura", and wrote, "If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress."[22]
After appearing in minor roles in Fall and Home Alone 3 in 1997, Johansson garnered widely spread attention for her performance in the 1998 film The Horse Whisperer, directed by Robert Redford.[7] She received a nomination for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress for the film.[23] In 1999, she appeared in My Brother the Pig and in 2001 in the neo-noir Coen brothers film The Man Who Wasn't There. Also in 1999, she appeared in the music video for Mandy Moore's single, "Candy".[24] Although the film was not a box office success,[25] she received praise for her break-out role[26] in Ghost World (2001).[27][28] Credited with "sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age",[29] In 2002, she appeared in Eight Legged Freaks.[30]
Johansson at the premiere of Girl with a Pearl Earring at Toronto International Film Festival in 2003
Johansson made the transition from teen roles to adult roles, with two roles in 2003.[31] In the Sofia Coppola film Lost in Translation, she played Charlotte, a listless and lonely young wife, opposite Bill Murray.[32][33] Roger Ebert wrote that he loved the film and described the performances of Johansson and Murray as "wonderful."[34] Entertainment Weekly wrote of Johansson's "embracing, restful serenity,"[35] and the New York Times said, "At 18, the actress gets away with playing a 25-year-old woman by using her husky voice to test the level of acidity in the air ... Ms. Johansson is not nearly as accomplished a performer as Mr. Murray, but Ms. Coppola gets around this by using Charlotte's simplicity and curiosity as keys to her character."[36] Johansson won the BAFTA Award[37] and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.[38][39] She received nominations from a number of film critic organizations, including the Broadcast Film Critics Association,[40] and the Chicago Film Critics Association,[41]
At age 18, Johansson played Griet in Peter Webber's Girl with a Pearl Earring. While noting, "Audiences feel as if they are spying on a moment of artistic inspiration when painter Vermeer creates the title work", USA Today praised her, suggesting, "[She] is having a banner year that Oscar voters should recognize."[42] In his review for the New Yorker, Anthony Lane said, "What keeps Webber's movie alive is the tenseness of the setup ... and, above all, the presence of Johansson. She is often wordless and close to plain onscreen, but wait for the ardor with which she can summon a closeup and bloom under its gaze; this is her film, not Vermeer's, all the way."[43] Owen Gleiberman, for Entertainment Weekly, wrote of her "nearly silent performance", observing, "The interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic."[44] She was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama[38] and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[37] She was nominated by the London Film Critics' Circle,[45] the Phoenix Film Critics Society.
Johansson was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2004.[46] The same year, she had voice or onscreen roles in five films: the The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie; A Good Woman, an adaptation of Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, which had a limited U.S. release, and was both a box office[47] and critical[48] failure, described by the New York Times as a "misbegotten Hollywood-minded screen adaptation" with "an excruciating divide between the film's British actors (led by Tom Wilkinson and Stephen Campbell Moore), who are comfortable delivering Wilde's aphorisms ... and its American marquee names, Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson, [who have] little connection to the English language as spoken in the high Wildean style";[49] the critically panned teen heist film The Perfect Score,[50] the romantic comedy In Good Company, a critical and box office success;[51] and, finally, the dark, Southern drama, A Love Song for Bobby Long, for which she earned her a third Golden Globe for Best Actress nomination.[38]
In July 2005, Johansson starred, with Ewan McGregor, in Michael Bay's science fiction film, The Island, in dual roles as Sarah Jordan and her clone, Jordan Two Delta. The film was a commercial failure[52][53] and received mixed critical reviews.[54][55] In contrast, her role as Nola, the American actress with whom Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is obsessed, in the Woody Allen-directed drama Match Point, was well received. The New York Times said, "Ms. Johansson and Mr. Rhys-Meyers manage some of the best acting seen in a Woody Allen movie in a long time, escaping the archness and emotional disconnection that his writing often imposes."[56] Johansson received her fourth Golden Globe nomination,[38] and one from the Chicago Film Critics Association, for Best Supporting Actress.[41]
In another collaboration with Allen, she was cast opposite Hugh Jackman and Allen in the 2006 film Scoop. While the film enjoyed a modest worldwide box office success,[57] it received mixed reviews by critics.[58][59] The same year, she appeared in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later said she was a De Palma fan and had wanted to work with him on the film, even though she thought that she was "physically wrong" for the part.[60]
Johansson next had a supporting role in the Christopher Nolan thriller The Prestige (2006), again opposite Hugh Jackman, as well as Christian Bale. Nolan, who described Johansson as possessing an "ambiguity... a shielded quality",[61] said he was "very keen" for her to play the role.[62] Johansson said, "I loved working with [Christopher Nolan]. He's incredibly focused and driven and involved, and really involved in the performance in every aspect. He's incredible to watch."[63] The film was both a critical[64] and a worldwide box office[65] success, recommended by the Los Angeles Times as "an adult, provocative piece of work."[66] Also in 2006, Johansson starred in the short film 'When The Deal Goes Down, directed by Bennett Miller, set to Bob Dylan's "When the Deal Goes Down...", released to promote Dylan's album, Modern Times.[67]
Johansson starred in 2007's The Nanny Diaries, alongside Laura Linney. The film performed only marginally well at the box office,[68] and was critically panned.[69] Johansson's reviews were mixed, with Variety saying, "[She] essays an engaging heroine",[70] while The New Yorker criticized her for looking "merely confused" while "trying to give the material a plausible emotional center".[71]
In 2008, she starred in The Other Boleyn Girl, with Natalie Portman and Eric Bana,[72] a film which garnered mixed reviews.[73][74] Writing for Rolling Stone, Pete Travers criticized the film for "[moving] in frustrating herks and jerks", but was more positive in his assessment of Johansson and Portman, and wrote, "What works is the combustible teaming of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, who give the Boleyn hotties a tough core of intelligence and wit, swinging the film's sixteenth-century protofeminist issues handily into this one."[75]
She filmed her third Woody Allen film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, in Spain,[76] appearing opposite Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz. The film was one of Allen's most profitable[77] and appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.
Johansson played the femme fatale Silken Floss in Frank Miller's film noir, comedy adaptation of The Spirit. The film received mostly poor reviews.[78]
Johansson appeared in the role of Anna, a yoga instructor, in the 2009 ensemble cast of He's Just Not That Into You, with Jennifer Connelly, Bradley Cooper, Drew Barrymore and Kevin Connolly. The film was a box office success[79] but only gained average critical reception.[80][81]
In March 2009, Johansson signed on to play Natalia Romanova/Natasha Romanoff, aka "The Black Widow" in Iron Man 2[82] after Emily Blunt turned down the role.[83] The film was released in May 2010.[84] The film was a box office success[85] and received mostly positive reviews from critics.[86] In 2011, Johansson played the role of Kelly, a zookeeper in the family film We Bought a Zoo. The film gained mainly favorable reviews.[87] Johansson reprised the role of Natasha Romanoff in The Avengers in 2012. The Avengers received positive reviews[88] and was highly successful at the box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide.[89]
In November 2011, it was reported she plans to make her directional debut by adapting Truman Capote's novel, Summer Crossing whose screenplay will be written by playwright Tristine Skyler.[90][91] Production on the film is slated to begin in the first half of 2014.[92] In early March 2012, it was announced that Johansson had been cast as Janet Leigh in the Sacha Gervasi-directed film Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho.[93][94] Released in November 2012, Hitchcock received mixed to positive reviews.[95]
Johansson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 2, 2012 located at 6931 Hollywood Blvd., in front of Madame Tussauds Hollywood wax museum.[96]
In 2012, Johansson was cast in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, Don Jon.[97] The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival[98] and had its wide release in September 2013. Don Jon received positive reviews.[99] Johansson's performance was highlighted by critics; Claudia Puig of USA Today stated that she "gives one of her best performances as the bossy, gum-chewing Jersey girl".[100] Also in 2013, Johansson voiced the character Samantha, an intelligent computer operating system, in the Spike Jonze film Her. She replaced Samantha Morton in the role.[101] The film received critical acclaim upon release[102] with Johansson's performance being well-received among critics.[103][104]
In November 2010, she was cast in Under the Skin, the film adaptation of Michel Faber's novel of the same name, directed by Jonathan Glazer,[105] appearing in a role which required full frontal nudity.[106] The film was released in the United States in 2014 to positive reviews.[107] Johansson's performance received a positive reception.[108][109]
Johansson reprised her role as Black Widow in the 2014 sequel Captain America: The Winter Soldier, alongside frequent co-star Chris Evans as the title character. Her involvement was confirmed in October 2012.[2] The film received positive reviews.[110] She will also play the Black Widow in the Avengers: Age of Ultron, alongside the original cast of the first Avengers film. The film will be released on May 1, 2015.[111] She will play Molly in the upcoming 2014 film Chef, alongside Jon Favreau, Robert Downey, Jr., and Sofía Vergara.[112] Johansson will also appear in Lucy, an action film directed by Luc Besson, set for release on August 8, 2014.[113]
Johansson made her first stage appearance when she was 8 years-old in the Off Broadway play Sophistry opposite Ethan Hawke.[114][115] In January 2010, following previews that began December 28, 2009, Johansson made her debut on Broadway, as Catherine Carbone in the drama A View from the Bridge, written by Arthur Miller and directed by Gregory Mosher. Liev Schreiber played opposite her.[116] Johansson won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play for her role in the play.[117] Her win received some backlash from critics and seasoned Broadway actors who felt she was undeserving of the award.[118]
Johansson starred as Maggie in a Broadway revival of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof beginning January 17, 2013.[119] Her performance received mixed reviews from critics.[120] Thom Geier, writing for Entertainment Weekly, wrote, "Scarlett Johansson brings a fierce fighting spirit to Maggie the Cat in director Rob Ashford's languorous revival ... Johansson shows a winning determination – to lure back her husband, to defend their share of his family's fortune, to maintain a sometimes shaky Southern accent."[121] On the other hand, reviewer Joe Dziemianowicz (The Daily News) called her performance "alarmingly one-note".[122]
Johansson has appeared in advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, L'Oréal and Louis Vuitton,[123] and has been the face of Spanish brand Mango since 2009.[124] After appearing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala with Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, Johansson was announced as the face of the new Dolce & Gabbana make-up collection in early 2009.[123] She made a personal appearance at the London store, Selfridges, on July 31, 2009, to help launch and promote the line.[125] Johansson was also the first Hollywood celebrity to become an ambassador for a Champagne House, after she became the spokesperson for Moët & Chandon and appeared in various advertisements and events for the brand.[126] In January 2014, the Sodastream home-carbonation system announced Johannson as its first brand ambassador.[127]
In 2005, Johansson was considered for the role of Maria[128] in Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End revival of The Sound of Music, though the role ultimately went to newcomer Connie Fisher (winner of the BBC talent show How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?)[129] Released on May 8, 2006, Johansson sang the track "Summertime" for Unexpected Dreams – Songs From the Stars, a non-profit collection of songs recorded by Hollywood actors. She performed with The Jesus and Mary Chain for a special Coachella Reunion Show in Indio, California in April 2007.[130]
In 2007, Johansson appeared as the leading lady in Justin Timberlake's music video, for "What Goes Around... Comes Around", which was nominated in August 2007 for video of the year at the MTV Video Music Awards.[131] In mid-2007, she spent about a month in Maurice, Louisiana recording an album at Dockside Studio. The album, consisting of one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits songs,[17][132] was produced by Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio and features David Bowie,[133] members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs[134] and Celebration.[135] Released on May 20, 2008, it was entitled Anywhere I Lay My Head.[136][137] Reviews of the album were mixed, or average.[138] Spin commented, "There's nothing particularly compelling about Scarlett Johansson's singing."[139] Conversely, some critics found it to be "surprisingly alluring",[140] "a bravely eccentric selection",[133] and "a brilliant album" with "ghostly magic".[141] The album was named the "23rd best album of 2008" by NME[142] and peaked at No.1 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and No. 126 on the Billboard 200 chart.[143] Of her album, Johansson said, "I had this golden opportunity to record and thought I would do maybe an album of standards, because I'm not a songwriter. I'm a vocalist."[144] Johansson said for her recording she "wanted to have space and [she] wanted to be in a remote place where all of us could just be ourselves and not worry about anyone trying to listen in or get in on that."[145] Johansson said in an interview that she started listening to Tom Waits when she was 11 or 12 years old.[146] Of Tom Waits, Johansson said in an interview, "His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and I had my own way of doing Tom Waits songs."[147] In December 2008, MTV reported Johansson planned to follow-up Anywhere I Lay My Head with an album of all original music, saying, "I don't think I'd do covers, so it'd be a project that I have to dedicate myself to. I feel like that's something for the future."[148]
In 2009, Johansson covered Jeff Buckley's "Last Goodbye" for the soundtrack of He's Just Not That Into You.[149] Released on September 8, 2009, she and singer/songwriter Pete Yorn recorded a collaborative album, Break Up, inspired by Serge Gainsbourg's duets with Brigitte Bardot.[150] In 2010, Steel Train released Terrible Thrills Vol. 1, which includes their favourite female artists singing songs from their self-titled album. Johansson is the first artist on the album, singing "Bullet".[151] In 2011, Johansson sang "One Whole Hour" for the soundtrack of the documentary film Wretches & Jabberers.[152][153] In 2012, Johansson added her voice to a J. Ralph track entitled "Before My Time" to the end credits of the climate documentary Chasing Ice. The song received a nomination from the Academy Awards in the "Best Original Song" category.[154]
Johansson appeared on the cover of the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair in the nude alongside actress Keira Knightley and fashion designer Tom Ford.[155] Maxim named Johansson No. 6 in their Hot 100 Issue in 2006,[156] No. 3 in 2007, [157] No. 2 in 2008,[158] No. 34 in 2009,[159] No. 14 in 2010,[160] No. 14 in 2011,[161] No. 17 in 2012[162] and No. 15 in 2013.[163] In November 2006, Johansson was named "Sexiest Woman Alive" by Esquire.[164] In February 2007, she was named the "Sexiest Celebrity" of the year by Playboy.[165] FHM has regularly ranked her as one of their 100 sexiest famous women since 2005.[166] During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen described Johansson as "sexually overwhelming", saying that he found it "very hard to be extra witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are."[167] In 2010, GQ named Johansson its Babe of the Year.[168] In 2011, Men's Health named her one of the "100 Hottest Women of All-Time", ranking her at No. 12.[169]
Johansson celebrates a "little of both" Christmas and Hanukkah,[170][171][172] and has described herself as Jewish.[8][173][174] She dislikes the "ScarJo" nickname commonly used in reference to her, calling it "awful" and "terrible".[175][176] In the May 2014 issue of Glamour, she stated, "I associate that name [ScarJo] with, like, pop stars. It sounds tacky. It's lazy and flippant."[177]
On September 14, 2011, the FBI announced it was investigating the alleged hacking of Johansson's cell phone and the dissemination of nude photographs of her.[178][179] Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Ryan Reynolds, three years prior to the incident.[180][181] As a result of the investigation, Christopher Chaney of Jacksonville, Florida pleaded guilty to computer hacking. In addition to a prison sentence for Chaney, prosecutors are requesting that he pay Johansson about $66,000 in compensation.[182]
From 2001–02, while Johansson attended the Professional Children's School, she dated classmate Jack Antonoff, who went on to become the guitarist for the band Fun.[183] She dated her Black Dahlia co-star Josh Hartnett for about two years until the end of 2006, with Hartnett citing their busy lives as the reason for the split.[184]
Johansson began dating Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds in 2007[185] and in May 2008 it was reported that they were engaged.[186] On September 27, 2008, the couple married in a quiet ceremony near Tofino, British Columbia.[185][187] They purchased a $2.8 million home together near Los Angeles.[188] On December 14, 2010, the couple announced their separation.[189] Their divorce was finalized on July 1, 2011.[190]
In November 2012, Johansson started dating Romain Dauriac, the owner of an independent advertising agency.[191][192] In September 2013, it was announced that Johansson and Dauriac were engaged.[193] As of 2014, Johansson lives in the Rive Gauche part of Paris, France with Dauriac.[194] In May 2014, Johannson's Break Up collaborator Pete Yorn stated she's "very pregnant." [195]
In 2005, Johansson became a Global Ambassador for the aid and development agency Oxfam.[196] In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid £20,000 on an eBay auction to benefit Oxfam, winning a hair and makeup treatment, a pair of tickets and a chauffered trip to accompany Johansson on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of He's Just Not That Into You.[197]
In January 2014, Johansson resigned from her Oxfam position after facing criticism[198] for her promotion of SodaStream, whose main factory is based in Mishor Adumim, an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, as Oxfam opposes all trade with Israeli settlements.[199] Johansson said she and Oxfam "have a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement".[200] In response to her resignation, Oxfam stated that it was "grateful for her many contributions ... [in] helping to highlight the impact of natural disasters and raise funds to save lives and fight poverty".[201][202]
Johansson is registered as an independent[203] and campaigned for Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 United States presidential election.[17] About George W. Bush's 2004 reelection, she said, "[I am] disappointed. I think it was a disappointment for a large percentage of the population."[204]
Johansson also campaigned for Democratic candidate Barack Obama:[205] Her efforts included appearances in Iowa during January 2008, where her efforts were targeted at younger voters;[206] an appearance at Cornell College;[207] and a speaking engagement at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota on Super Tuesday, 2008.[208] Johansson appeared in the 2008 music video for The Black Eyed Peas front man will.i.am's song, "Yes We Can", directed by Jesse Dylan, a song inspired by Obama's speech following the 2008 New Hampshire primary.[209] On February 7, 2012, Johansson and Anna Wintour hosted a fashion launch of pro-Obama clothing, bags and accessories, with proceeds going to the President's re-election campaign.[210] She addressed voters at the Democratic National Convention on September 6, 2012, calling for President Obama's reelection and for more engagement from young voters.[211]

1992-1993Acting Too CommercialAt age 7, Johansson starts auditioning for commercials and becomes disinterested. "It was like a cattle call," she tells Allure in 2005. "[My mom and I] decided I'd just go out for film. I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread." After taking weekend acting classes at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in Manhattan, an 8-year-old Johansson appears opposite Ethan Hawke in an off-Broadway production of Sophistry. "I had two lines," she tells Allure.1994-1996Fate Plays a HandIn Rob Reiner's North, Johansson, 9, makes her film debut as John Ritter's daughter.

Her director and costar Robert Redford famously calls her "13 going on 30." She tells Esquire in 2005, "That film changed things for me in a lot of ways. I went through this realization that acting, at its heart, is the ability to manipulate your own emotions."
2003September 12Found in TranslationJohansson, fresh out of high school, stars in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation, playing a lonely twentysomething who befriends Bill Murray during a trip to Tokyo.  The film opens to rave reviews, catapulting Johansson onto Hollywood's A-List and earning her a Best Comedic Actress Golden Globe nomination. December 12Girl with a NominationGirl with a Pearl Earring hits theaters. Johansson earns her second Best Actress Golden Globe nod for portraying a quiet 17th century Dutch maid, the inspiration for Johannes Vermeer's famous painting. "It was emotionally draining, but not difficult," she says of the role to New York Magazine. "It's much easier to let the emotions play across your face than to have to fumble around with silly dialogue."2004MayLeto LoveJohansson is first spotted hanging out with actor Jared Leto in L.A. Johansson never discusses the relationship; the two are an off-and-on item for the next year.December 29Double DutyCementing her status as an A-list actress, Johansson releases two movies on the same day: In Good Company with Topher Grace and A Love Song for Bobby Long with John Travolta. She goes on to earn her third Golden Globe nod for Bobby Long.

 July 22Lights, Camera, Action!Johansson makes her action movie debut opposite Ewan McGregor in The Island. "It [was] exhausting! I've never run so much in my life," she tells PEOPLE.

                She made her name in independent films before Lost In Translation propelled her onto Hollywood's A-list. The Island dented her stellar reputation but this starlet is sure to fight back.Scarlett has a twin brother, Hunter, born to father Karsten, a New York architect, and mother, Melanie (now Scarlett's manager). They have an older half-brother, Christian, an older sister, Vanessa, and an older brother, Adrian.  Their father was born in Denmark and their mother is from Polish stock, who emigrated to the Bronx. Karsten and Melanie separated when the twins were 13-years old, and are now divorced.  Johansson's parents were very open about allowing her to pursue her interests. She apparently told her mother at the tender age of three, "I have a fire in my brain to act". Her early desire to be in musicals, led to her attending tap dance classes and she auditioned for a few advertisements. She enjoyed a normal family life and attended regular school in New York.  She was only seven-years-old when she became seriously aspiring and her acting career was launched in the off-Broadway production on 'Sophistry' (1992), with Ethan Hawke. At age eight, Johansson had an uncredited role in a skit on television show 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien' (1993), during its first year on air.  Her film debut came at age nine, when she played the role of Laura Nelson in comedy drama 'North' (1994), about an attention-deprived boy, North, who files a lawsuit against his parents and sets off around the world to find replacements who really care about him.  Following that, Johansson appeared as Kate Armstrong in 'Just Cause' (1995), Harvard law professor Paul Armstrong's (Sean Connery) daughter. Also in the cast were Lawrence Fishburne and Blair Underwood.  In the comedy, 'If Lucy Fell' (1996), she had the role of Emily, co-starring with the likes of Ben Stiller, Sarah Jessica Parker and Elle Macpherson. By age 11, Johansson had been nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her role as Amanda, in the drama about two runaway sisters, 'Manny & Lo' (1996).  Her next two films would only bring her small roles, with her two-word contribution in 'Fall' (1997), and the unremarkable part of middle child, Molly, in 'Home Alone 3' (1998).  Her next big role saw Johansson playing 14-year-old Grace MacLean in 'The Horse Whisperer' (1998), based on the hugely successful novel by Nicholas Evans. Robert Redford both directed and starred in the film, as well as Tom Booker, with Kristin Scott Thomas and Sam Neill. Johansson received a Hollywood Reporter Young Star award for this role.  In 1998, she auditioned for a role in 'The Parent Trap' but it went to Lindsay Lohan instead.  She had the starring role, as Kathy, in the comedy 'My Brother the Pig' (1999), a children's film about a boy who is turned into a pig, and his sister who tries to help get him changed back before their parents return from holiday.  Then came 'Ghost World' (2001), a screen adaptation of the Daniel Clowes comic about the adventures of two teenage girls dealing with life after school. Johansson played 18-year-old Rebecca, whilst herself only 15, in a sensitive portrayal of teenage angst, growing up and friendships.  Johansson starred as Rachel 'Birdy' Abundas, with Billy Bob Thornton, in 'The Man Who Wasn't There' (2001), a black and white film about passion, crime and punishment. In 'An American Rhapsody' (2001), with Nastassja Kinski, she is a young girl who escapes communist Hungary in the 1950s and travels to America. It was a demanding role, based on true events, and another opportunity to prove her talent as a serious actor.  After all this seriousness, Johansson appeared as Ashley Parker in the rather camp remake of 1950s B-movies about giant spiders, 'Eight Legged Freaks' (2002).  Johansson had always attended the Professional Children's School, in Manhattan, New York, and she graduated in 2002, announcing her intention to study Film at Purchase University, New York, starting in September 2003. She applied but unfortunately, was not accepted.  She then decided to put all her energy into her career, which soon paid off. Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation' (2003), set in Tokyo, came along and Johansson gave a touching performance as Charlotte, a young newlywed, who strikes up a relationship with a jaded movie star, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), while staying in Japan. For this, she won the Upstream Prize for Best Actress, and was only 17 when the film was shot.  Her dramatic skills amply displayed, she next worked on 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' (2003), playing Griet in this intriguing, highly seductive story behind one of Vermeer's greatest paintings.  In June 2004, Johansson was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). She appeared as Francesca Curtis in the teenage comedy/crime 'The Perfect Score' (2004). This was followed by her role as Parsy Will, with John Travolta, in 'A Love Song for Bobby Long' (2004).  Also released that year was 'A Good Woman' (2004), in which Johansson played Lady Windermere in this screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play 'Lady Windermere's Fan'. She was the voice of Mindy in 'The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie' (2004), where she worked with David Hasselhoff, one of her childhood heartthrobs. 'In Good Company' (2004) brought her the role of Alex Foreman, the type of woman Johansson says she would be if she had not chosen to be act: "…very cool, very relaxed, and very honest".  The futuristic 'The Island’ (2005), set in the mid 21st-century, saw Johansson playing Jordan Two-Delta, with Ewan McGregor and Steve Buscemi. She and McGregor reportedly found the rigours of all the running and action of the movie agonising and discovered muscles they had forgotten about.  Johansson was directed by Woody Allen for her role of Nola Rice in 'Match Point' (2005), shot entirely in England, and also starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Also that year was 'The Black Dahlia' (2005), directed by Brian De Palma, an adaptation of the James Ellroy novel about a 1947 Hollywood murder. In it, Johansson starred as Kay Lake, with Hilary Swank and Josh Hartnett.  She followed this with a role in 'The Prestige' with Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman in 2006. The following year, Johansson only appeared in one film 'The Nanny Diaries' as she focused on her musical career.  In mid-2007, she spent time recording a music album consisting of one original song and ten covers of Tom Waits' songs. It also featured contributions from David Bowie, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration. Her album 'Anywhere I Lay My Head' was released to mixed reviews on 20 May 2008.  She returned to acting in 2008, playing Mary Boleyn in the adaptation of Phillipa Gregory's novel 'The Other Boleyn Girl', followed by 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' and 'The Spirit'.  In 2009, Johansson appeared in 'He's Just Not That Into You', before making her debut as the Black Widow in 'Iron Man 2' in 2010. She will be reprising this role in the 2012 film 'Avengers Assemble' and possibly in 'Iron Man 3', which is set for release in 2013.  Johansson will also be starring in 'Under the Skin' in 2012 and has been singled out for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Next year, she will play Janet Leigh in 'Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho' and will also act in 'Don Jon's Addiction' and 'Can A Song Save Your Life?'.  Johansson has proved her natural acting ability time and again and she is recognised as one of the most promising young Hollywood actors. She is not in it for the money, but rather to build a career. This is, and always has been, her life's passion. There is no doubt that she will continue to select extraordinary roles and continue to play them with sensitivity and depth.  A multi-million dollar deal with L'Oreal was confirmed on 5 January 2006. Johansson was the face of the new colour line 'HIP High Intensity Pigments'. The deal is reportedly worth $3million, with the company hoping to generate a further $50million in sales in the first year.  Johansson is known for being extremely private about her love life but it is known that she started dating Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds in 2007, with the couple becoming engaged on 5 May 2008. They married in a quiet ceremony on 27 September 2008 and bought a home together in California.  On 14 December 2010, they announced they had separated citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalised on 1 July 2011.  She currently divides her personal time between New York, where she sees her father and her twin brother, Hunter, and Los Angeles, where her mother lives. In fact, Johansson bought an apartment in the same block as her mother, who besides being her business manager, provides her with love, encouragement and support.
