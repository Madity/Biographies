Kristen Jaymes Stewart (born April 9, 1990)[1] is an American actress who is best known for playing Bella Swan in The Twilight Saga film series and for her prolific work in independent films. She has also starred in films such as Panic Room (2002), Speak (2004), Zathura (2005), The Messengers (2007), Adventureland (2009), The Runaways (2010), Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), On the Road (2012), Camp X-Ray (2014) and Clouds of Sils Maria (2014) . She will star in adaptations of the books Still Alice and Equals, with both movies projected for release in 2015.
Stewart was born in 1990 and raised in Los Angeles, California by parents in the entertainment industry.[2][3][4] Her father John Stewart is a stage manager and television producer who has worked for Fox.[5] Her mother Jules Mann-Stewart is originally from Maroochydore, Queensland, Australia. She is a script supervisor and has also directed a film.[4][6][7][8] She has an older brother, Cameron B. Stewart, and two adopted brothers, Dana and Taylor.[9][10]
Stewart attended local schools until the seventh grade. As she became more involved in acting, she continued her education by correspondence until completing high school.[4][11]
As she grew up with a family who worked behind the camera, Stewart thought she would become a screenwriter/director, but never considered being an actor.
"I never wanted to be the center of attention – I wasn't that 'I want to be famous, I want to be an actor' kid. I never sought out acting, but I always practiced my autograph because I love pens. I'd write my name on everything."[12]
She began acting at the age of eight, after an agent saw her perform in her elementary school's Christmas play.[13]
After auditioning for a year, Stewart gained her first role in a small, nonspeaking role in the Disney Channel original film, The Thirteenth Year.[5] Her next film was The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, where she played the "ring toss girl".[5] She also appeared in the independent film The Safety of Objects (2001), in which she played the tomboy daughter of a troubled single mother (Patricia Clarkson). Stewart also played a tomboy, diabetic daughter of a divorced mother (Jodie Foster) in the film Panic Room (2002). She was nominated for a Young Artist Award for her performance.[14] After Panic Room's success, Stewart was cast in another thriller, Cold Creek Manor (2003), playing the daughter of characters played by Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone. She was nominated again for a Young Artist Award for her performance.[14] About this time in her career, she started homeschooling because of her irregular schedule.
Stewart's first starring role was at age 14 in the children's action-comedy Catch That Kid (2004), opposite Max Thieriot and Corbin Bleu. That year Stewart also played the role of Lila in the thriller, Undertow (2004). Stewart starred in the Lifetime/Showtime television film Speak (2004), based on the novel by the same name by Laurie Halse Anderson. Stewart, 13 at the time of filming, played a high school freshman, Melinda Sordino, who after being raped nearly stops speaking. Her performance was widely praised, with The New York Times stating "Ms. Stewart creates a convincing character full of pain and turmoil."[15]
Stewart appeared in the fantasy-adventure film Zathura (2005), playing the role of Lisa, the irresponsible older sister of two little boys. During their playing a board game, they turn their house into a spacecraft hurtling uncontrollably in outer space. The film was praised by critics, but Stewart's performance did not garner much media attention. Her character is immobilized during most of the film.[16] The next year, she played the character Maya in Fierce People (2006), directed by Griffin Dunne. After that film, she received the lead role of Jess Solomon in the supernatural thriller film The Messengers.
Stewart appeared as teenager Lucy Hardwicke in In the Land of Women (2007), a romantic drama starring Meg Ryan and Adam Brody. The film, as well as Stewart's performance, received mixed reviews. That same year, Stewart had a small role in the Sean Penn-directed adaptation Into the Wild. For her portrayal of Tracy – a teenage singer who has a crush on young adventurer Christopher McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch) – Stewart received mixed reviews. While Salon.com considered her work a "sturdy, sensitive performance", and the Chicago Tribune noted that she did "vividly well with a sketch of a role," Variety's critic Dennis Harvey said, "It's unclear whether Stewart means to be playing hippie-chick Tracy as vapid, or whether it just comes off that way."[17][18][19] After Into the Wild, Stewart had a cameo appearance in Jumper and also appeared in What Just Happened, which was released in October 2008.[20] She co-starred in The Cake Eaters, an independent film that has been screened only at film festivals. Both the film and Stewart's performance received many positive reviews.[21] Critics such as Bill Goodykoontz from The Arizona Republic said that Stewart "really shines.... She excels at both aspects of the performance, giving Georgia a strength that defies any sort of pity one might feel for her, without letting us forget her vulnerability".[22]
On November 16, 2007, Summit Entertainment announced that Stewart would play main character Isabella "Bella" Swan in the film Twilight, based on Stephenie Meyer's bestselling vampire romance novel of the same name.[23] Stewart was on the set of Adventureland when director Catherine Hardwicke visited her for an informal screen test, which "captivated" the director.[24] She starred alongside Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward Cullen, her vampire boyfriend. The film began production in February 2008 and finished filming in May 2008.
Twilight was released domestically on November 21, 2008.[25] Stewart's performance garnered mixed reviews with some critics describing her as "the ideal casting choice" and praising her for conveying "Bella's detachment, as well as her need to bust through it;" others criticized her acting for being "wooden" and lacking variety in her facial expressions, which they described as "blank".[26][27]
She received praise for her role in Adventureland (2009). Critic James Berardinelli of Reelviews said, "Stewart is more than merely appealing in this role – she makes Em a fully realized woman, and some of the most intricate development results from what the camera observes in Stewart's eyes.".[28] Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan said Stewart was "beautiful, enigmatic and very experienced".[29] and MSN Movies James Rocchi stated, "Stewart's vulnerable, spooky power is used to nice effect." [30] Stewart reappeared as Bella in the sequel, The Twilight Saga: New Moon, once again receiving mixed reviews for her performance. Jordan Mintzer from Variety called Stewart "the heart and soul of the film" and praised her for giving "both weight and depth to dialogue...she makes Bella's psychological wounds seem like the real deal."
On the other hand, Manohla Dargis from The New York Times said Stewart's "lonely-girl blues soon grow wearisome," and Billy Goodykoontz from The Arizona Republic stated "Stewart is a huge disappointment... She sucks the energy right out of the film".[31][32][33] She reprised this role in The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.
At the 2010 82nd Annual Academy Awards, Stewart and Twilight co-star Taylor Lautner presented a tribute in honor of the horror movie genre.[34]
In 2009, Stewart starred in The Yellow Handkerchief, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival and was released into theaters in 2010 by Samuel Goldwyn Films. She also starred alongside James Gandolfini in Welcome to the Rileys, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2010.
In 2010, Stewart portrayed rock star Joan Jett in The Runaways, a biographical film of the titular band of the same name from writer-director Floria Sigismondi.[35] Stewart met with Jett over the 2008–2009 New Year to prepare for the role; she prerecorded songs in a studio for the film.[36] She received praise for her performance: the Metro Times wrote, "It turns out that Stewart is actually really good at capturing Jett's icy, tough-but-cool girl swagger, adding the needed touches of vulnerability that transform it into a pretty terrific performance... Stewart is a genuine rock star here."[37] Also, A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted "Ms. Stewart, watchful and unassuming, gives the movie its spine and soul."[38] The same year, Stewart was listed as the highest-earning female actress in Vanity Fair's "2010's Top Hollywood Top Earners List," with an estimated earning of $28.5 million for her movie roles in 2010.[39]
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 was released on November 18, 2011. Though the film received negative reviews, Stewart's performance was praised. Gabriel Chong called Stewart's performance "mesmerising" and said that she "makes [Bella's] every emotion keenly felt that runs the gamut from joy, trepidation, anxiety, distress and above all quiet and resolute determination."[40] The Village Voice's Dan Konis said Stewart "beautifully underplays" the role.[41] Some critics found Pattinson and Stewart's chemistry lacking and said that the relationship came off like a "charade" onscreen, or that none of the three leads was convincing in his role.[42][43] She concluded the role in the finale, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2, in November 2012.
On December 6, 2011, Stewart was named number one on Forbes magazine's list of "Hollywood's Best Actors for the Buck."[44] On January 13, 2012, she became the face of a new unnamed Balenciaga perfume; in June, its name was promoted as "Florabotanica".[45]
Stewart starred as Snow White in the film Snow White and the Huntsman (2012).[46] Stewart appears as Mary Lou in On the Road, the film adaption of Jack Kerouac's novel of the same name, which became a cult classic.[47]
According to Forbes, Stewart was the highest paid actress in 2012, with total earnings of $34.5 million.[48] She earned $12.5 million each for last two installments in the Twilight series, including royalties. She ranked #7 on AskMen's list of Top 99 Women for 2013.[49]
On 11 December 2013, Chanel announced that Stewart was its "new face" for a Western-inspired fashion collection. The campaign has been shot by Karl Lagerfeld and was released in May 2014.[50][51] In 2014, Balenciaga released a new fragrance, Rosabotanica, with Stewart remaining the face of the brand.[52]
Camp X-Ray, her first film of 2014, was premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on 16 January.[53] Her portrayal of a young soldier stationed at Guantanamo Bay was met with positive reviews from the critics. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called it "her best screen work to date as an inexperienced military guard",[54] while Xan Brooks of The Guardian said, "It's a role that reminds us what a fine performer she was in the likes of Into the Wild and Adventureland."[55]
Stewart next appeared alongside Juliette Binoche and Chloë Grace Moretz in Clouds of Sils Maria. The film had its premiere at 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[56][57] Her performance in the film earned her favourable reviews. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that "Stewart’s habitual low-keyed style, which can border on the monotone, functions as effectively underplayed contrast."[58] Peter Debruge of Variety praised her, saying that "Stewart is the one who actually embodies what Binoche’s character most fears, countering the older actress’ more studied technique with the same spontaneous, agitated energy that makes her the most compellingly watchable American actress of her generation."[59]
Stewart was cast in Tim Blake Nelson's Anesthesia, an ensemble about group of New Yorkers.[60] She will also appear alongside Julianne Moore in Still Alice.[61] In April 2014, she started filming American Ultra alongside Jesse Eisenberg.[62]
Stewart is to play the muse Delphi in the upcoming The Big Shoe, which will be directed by Steven Shainberg.[63] She will also co-star along with Nicholas Hoult in Drake Doremus' futuristic love story Equals.[64]
Stewart lives in Los Angeles. She is interested in attending college in the near future, saying, "I want to go to college for literature. I want to be a writer. I mean, I love what I do, but it's not all I want to do – be a professional liar for the rest of my life."[65]
In a November 2008 interview with Vanity Fair, Stewart said that she was in a relationship at the time with Michael Angarano, her co-star from the 2004 film Speak.[66]
Since meeting on the set of Twilight in 2008, Stewart was in a very low-profile relationship with co-star Robert Pattinson.[67] For a long time, the two did not explicitly confirm a relationship, but paparazzi photographs and eyewitness accounts drove intense media and fan speculation and attention.[68] However, Stewart officially acknowledged her relationship with Pattinson for the first time in July 2012, when Us Weekly published photos of Stewart showing affection with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders.[69] The day the photos were released, Stewart issued a public apology to Pattinson at People Magazine, saying, "I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry.[70]"

      Baton Rouge, Louisiana filming The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (2011). [October 2010]
      Finished filming for Twilight (2008) on Friday, May 2nd 2008. "Twilight" is due to hit theaters November 21, 2008. [May 2008]
      She is filming The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) with co-star Robert Pattinson. [January 2009]
      Ranked #1 on the list of "Hollywood's Top-Earning Actresses in 2012" by Forbes Magazine. Her income between May 2011 and May 2012 was estimated to be $34.5 million.
      On working on the film Panic Room (2002) with such a big name star as Jodie Foster: "When I got "Panic Room", I'm like, 'Oh my God that's huge! It's bigger than huge'. I was kind of freaked out at first".
      (about her love for acting) I love it because I love to tell stories. I like being in movies that have a great story. I'm not so interested in being a Hollywood star. It's a job, you know. When you wake up at six in the morning every day for a week, it feels like hard work.
      Acting is such a personal thing, which is weird because at the same time it's not. It's for the consumption of other people. But in terms of creative outlets and expressing yourself, it's just the most extreme version of that that I've ever found. It's like running, it's exertion. When you reach that point where you can't go anymore and you stop and you take a breath, it's that same sort of clearing of the mind.
      A lot of actors think that what we do is so important, like we're saving people's lives or something.
      I start everything from the same place, with that sense of responsibility. On a bigger movie, you have to be aware that you can only control your aspect of the film. It's nice to be on a smaller movie because you're working with your friends and you feel so close-knit. It's your movie and you can do anything you want, and nobody's going to have anything to say. With a bigger movie, it concerns so many people. It's so much more of a process. But, in terms of what I do personally, it has to be the same, or else I'm just on some big movie, being a liar, and I can't do that.
      Really, I'm incredibly disjointed and not candid. Just in general, my thoughts tend to come out in little spurts that don't necessarily connect. If you hang around long enough, you can find the linear path. But it will take a second. That is why these interviews never go well for me.
      About having an aha moment when it came to pursuing an acting career: I have the "Aha" moments progressively -- they're like milestones and they hit you. I think my first "Aha!" moment was when I did this movie called "Speak." I was just rolling with it, and ended up kind of really losing myself in it, so that I felt like I was a different person at the end. That was a big moment.
      You should have the opportunity to be more than one person with different people - because you have that within you. It's not like you're faking it. If everyone knows you so well and can always get a hold of you, then you're stuck to this thing that people think you are. You should have the opportunity to reinvent yourself. Because you do. Naturally.
      On whether she wants to develop her skills as a writer: I do want to work on writing, because writing's a skill. Writing is something that you can train yourself to know better. To know yourself better. And it's intimidating as hell. I mean, I definitely will always do what I've been doing. I've also started taking a lot of pictures, and they help the writing. The pictures help the writing. I mean, I want to make books. I want to take pictures and then write all over the pictures. And then I don't have to say a complete story, because I have the picture, and I have just a word.
      About Bella in New Moon: Well, she loses what basically gives her the drive to do anything in her whole life. She loses the man she's in love with, but she also loses her entire life plan, and she's so young to have to be forced into a decision like that. It's just a glorified, elaborate version of the worst breakup you've ever been through. All of a sudden you question everything. All of a sudden you know nothing and you're dropped in the middle of a freezing cold ocean. Oddly, we have a character that's warm enough and bright enough to bring her out of that, and it's truly gut-ripping. Because as perfect as Jacob is for her, she holds on to an ideal, the ultimate fiery love that she has for Edward even though it's not comfortable, it's not practical and it's not a good idea.
      This weird thing happens when you're in a movie that has some level of success. People start offering you all kinds of things, and they just expect you to do them because they'll be good for your career. It's not about the project's integrity or anything like that. It's about raising your profile and all that crap.
      I was just in Botswana in Africa. I wanted to learn something about the world. I just feel really ignorant whenever I leave the country. I don't know a lot of stuff, and I really want to. I figure that traveling is a good way to start if you want knowledge. Like, if you don't know something about a country, then go and check it out. That's what I did.
      On how her life has changed since Twilight: My life hasn't changed. Most circumstances I find myself in are different than they were a year ago, but I myself haven't changed...however a normal 18-year-old girl would change in a year. But it makes things so much easier. I would do it for free every day [even] if nobody saw it. I cannot describe how good it feels to actually have something that is truly into your heart and soul actually affecting people. And that's amazing. So that's the biggest change.
      On whether she wants to continue making movies or go to college: I absolutely have no foresight. I used to think I had a lot when I was younger. I worked really hard in school to give myself options, and I've literally taken those options and thrown them down the toilet. Purposely - not to make that sound totally negative. It's what I want. I want to keep doing what I'm doing. It's funny, people ask me all the time: 'What do you do for fun? What do you do when you're not acting?' It's a strange thing, acting. It's a business, it's a job, everything like that. All it is, is self-reflection. You just never stop caring about people and I've never stopped doing that, so I'm sure it'll seep into other areas of my life. I want to write. I'm not going to school because I can't take the structure of it, but I'm not going to stop learning.
      Usually I come in and sit down at roundtables in America and they look at me like 'what is wrong with you?' Just because I don't fit...nobody fits into the frame that typical Hollywood young actresses do, but they try to. They try to be this thing. Try to memorize answers and make everybody happy. That's so horrifying and scary to me. So when you're not that, you get criticized for it. You get criticized for being honest and criticized for being nervous. So that's kind of annoying. I do a whole day of press and then I get calls from publicity people that are like, 'you might want to be a little bit more bubbly'. And I'm like, 'no'. People get very upset in the States. It's weird. Fans of the book especially. They don't understand me. Which is fine. I guess it doesn't really matter who I am, it just matters that they like the movie.
      On doing interviews: Self-evaluation is not my strong point, and you're constantly asked to critique yourself. You just spent three months on a set and your whole life is wrapped up in that - and then it's like, "Okay, define that right now in five seconds." I can't do that. I used to get so nervous that I would become a completely different person - and then they would think that was me. So I've tried to calm down, but no one's ever going to write, "Oh, she's actually just a pretty f---in' average chick who really loves what she does." That's not gonna happen.
      On how fame changed her life: There's nothing you can do about it, to be honest. I don't leave my hotel room -- literally, I don't. I don't talk to anybody about my personal life, and maybe that perpetuates it, too. But it's really important to own what you own and keep it to yourself. That said, the only way for me not to have somebody know where I went the night before is if I didn't go out at all. I'm trading. It depends on what mood I'm in. Some nights, I think, 'You know what? I don't care. I'm going to do what I want to do.' Then the next day I think, 'Ugh. Now everyone thinks I'm going out to get the attention.' and I'm like, 'No, actually, for a second, thought that maybe I could be like a normal person.'
      Speech after winning an Orange Bafta (2010): Wow. Thank you. I guess first I have to thank all the fans of Twilight for proving again and again to be THE most devoted and attentive fans ever. Considering this is voted, credit is due to them so thank you. To the other actors nominated, I am so blown away by you that I can't even describe it. To be voted among you is just overwhelming. And I'd like to say hi to my family.
      People always ask me if Im dating Robert [Pattinson]. It's beyond annoying. What I say is, that, why would I want anything that's private to become entertainment for other people?
      My family are amazing. I had like, the perfect upbringing. It sucks for people like Lindsay [Lohan], but it's not her fault she's so off the rails - and she's smart, very smart.
      I'm totally preoccupied with cooking. And now I'm obsessed with the Food Network. I like Paula Deen because she's hilarious,.
      It's weird, because I would be the last person in my school to be in plays, but I was forced to sing a song in a school thing. I sang a dreidel song, which is funny for me. I've never celebrated Hanukkah - it wasn't in my upbringing, but it was one of those deals where everybody has to pick a song or participate somehow in the chorus. It wasn't the normal dreidel song; I can't really remember the words, but it was a more serious dreidel song. The dreidel was huge, it was really honored. And that's how I met my agent, who was in the audience. I was eight.
      [on her hair]: Since I started acting I have never had by natural color, which is light brown. But it's fine, it's funny seeing yourself look different.
      I'm asked all the time in interviews about who I am, and I know a few people my age who have a strong sense of self, but I couldn't say I know myself and sum it up and give it to you in a little package. I don't know myself at all yet.
      I wouldn't tell you anything about anybody I cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people, and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life. I would never tell you if I was dating anybody.
      [on the down-side of fame]: There's no way to eloquently put this. I just can't go to the mall. It bothers me that I can't be outside very often. And also to not ever be just 'some girl' again. Just being some chick at some place, that's gone.
      Anytime I hear that somebody's really rich, the first question is, 'Do you do anything with it? Or do you, like, chill? You just sit on it?'
      What you don't see are the cameras shoved in my face and the bizarre intrusive questions being asked, or the people falling over themselves, screaming and taunting to get a reaction.
      It's impossible to always get across what I'm trying to say, but, if I just stay honest, then I'm not going to look back on any of these interviews and wonder what I was trying to do or be.
      [on her rise to fame and claims that she is ungrateful or unhappy]: I totally am more comfortable now. I try not to have a celebrity skin, which is why I think I run into problems. So many people say 'Why don't you just play the part?' I do, I really try to do that. I guess I should get a face transplant or something. I really love what I do, I really love everybody that I've ever worked with, I've gotten really lucky. I'm very appreciative, so that always kills me.
      I think it's funny that when I go onstage to accept an award, they think I'm nervous, uncomfortable, and awkward - and I am - but those are bad words for them.
      [on the paparazzi]: Once somebody finds out, you have to get the hell out of wherever you are. People freak out. And the photographers, they're vicious. They're mean. They're like thugs. I don't event want to drive around by myself anymore. It's dangerous.
      I don't think there's anything about being a celebrity that is desirable. I understand that everybody's going to know who you are and what you look like, but why be so obsessive?
      Maybe I'm completely different from everyone else. There are a lot of girls who can't wait to get married and plan their wedding a long time in advance. I'm not like that. I do want to start a family at some point, but I don't know when.
      [on punching Chris Hemsworth] I have to say for anyone who's ever been in that situation where, as a girl, you think it's not going to do anything. It fucking does something. He was standing over me and I just went "boom!" I spun him around. I punched him right out of his close-up and then I started crying. I felt horrible.
      The strangest part about being famous is you don't get to give first impressions anymore. Everyone already has an impression of you before you meet them.
      On Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) I'm having the most fulfilling experience as an actor. I'm close with Rupert Sanders, have his ear, and it's to his credit that I feel this way because I'm getting my first taste of really collaborating. Usually as an actor you put your hands up and go, "that's not my thing." I love acting. Honestly, I love looking at the call sheet where it says my character's name above my name. That's what I'm here for, but it's also cool to be on their level. To give an opinion and be taken seriously.
      I can't wait to not be working and go home and gain some interests. I want to see what I'm into. I want to figure out what I want.
      [on wearing colored contacts in Twilight] The contacts suck so badly. You can't see anything thus people cannot see you, I feel. There is just no getting in there.
      [on choosing to leave public school] School became genuinely uncomfortable. I was feeling a little self-conscious about the acting thing with my peers, but also my teachers became a problem. They didn't want to do the extra work or put packages together so I could keep up while away. They failed me. My teachers failed me. Not one, but all of them. I'm always slightly ashamed, in a way, about what I do. I'm slightly embarrassed as I had such serious ambitions when I was younger. I just never imagined that I would ever have a reason not to go to school, but then this happened.
      [on her role as Melinda Sordino in Speak (2004)] I was definitely aware of the film's subject matter, and it wasn't because of anything that had happened in my own life. Not at all. I grew up in a happy household.
      It took me a long time to realize that I was a girl as a teenager. At that point I never really believed it. I looked like a boy for a long time. Now, finally, I feel like a woman.
      [on the paparazzi] It really is not a nightmare, it's just one of those things. I guarantee whenever I get married or have a baby, everyone is going to want to know my kid's name and I'm not going to say it for ages. That's just the way I want to do it. It'll come out but it won't have come from me. They're going to be really pissed off that I won't say it and I'm just going to say, "No!"
      If a woman isn't happy and un-opinionated and long-haired and pretty, then she's weird and ugly. I just don't get it. I hate it when they say I'm ungrateful and I fucking hate it when they say I don't give a shit, because nobody cares more than I do. I'm telling you I don't know anybody who does this that gives a shit more than I do.
      The reason I feel compelled to do movies is because of whatever feeling you get when you read it. And to have four years of not being done [with the Twilight Saga] it constantly weighs on you. You're constantly thinking about going back and finishing the series.
      Every day you come home from work you go, like, God I wish I could go back and do yesterday again because I'm better now.
      I know that I don't seem like the type of person that really loves to be in the center of things, but anyone to deny the type of energy, like the effect of shared love, you'd have to be a sociopath to not let it in.
      As an actor your life is so wrapped up in your job. It's not normal. People's jobs don't affect their whole lives. Mine is why I love my life and so to talk about it to you guys [the media] and to know that it's not just you guys, that I'm talking through you to the fucking world, it's really scary at first. Now it's not only because I'm used to it. It just takes time.
      I don't want to be Angelina Jolie. Not that Angelina Jolie is not the most talented, beautiful, successful, amazing, admirable person who does good things for the world, but I don't want to be a movie star like that. I don't think there's anything about being a celebrity that is desirable. I understand that everybody's going to know who you are and what you look like, but why be so obsessive?
      I would never cheapen my relationship by talking about them. People say, 'Just say who you're dating. Then people will stop being so ravenous about it.' It's like, No they won't! They'll ask for specifics.
      [on playing Marylou in On the Road (2012)] She's generous in every aspect of her life and she wants it back just at much. I'm a slightly different person. I think that I liken myself much more to Sal's character, so to be that person running down the street with everyone chasing after was different. I think also she's so completely self-aware but not self-conscious and the same time and, like, I don't know how else to describe it other than there's just a generosity of absolutely everything. Because she wants everything in return she is willing to give you absolutely anything and I'm not like that. So it was fun. I also think that's why I loved the book initially. I wanna keep up with these characters. It's not that I'm so not like them, it's just that they inspire me.
      [on working with female directors] It's hard to generalize about that subject because the women I've worked with have all been so different. But if there's one consistency, it might be that you do have to handle yourself differently on a set. Women can be more emotional - at least they sometimes show it more.
      Nowadays it's harder because everyone is on Facebook and everyone knows where you are all the time, and everyone's Twittering. I'm going to die because somebody is going to say where I am and somebody is going to kill me. Someone's going to Twitter my location and it's going to be, like, BOOM!
      [on the birth scene in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (2011)] Even though the birth scene is horrible and grotesque, I think it's just the most beautiful moment. The fact that it's so gruesome and awful is why it's so gorgeous.
      We push boundaries in this business in terms of getting to know people. There are things that directors know about me that people shouldn't know.
      I have this weird aversion to people going, "It's a nice, strong female movie. It's really strong." It's almost like you're kind of discrediting the strength.

1990sSetting the StageAn agent contacts Stewart's parents after seeing the 8-year-old perform at her elementary school's Christmas play. After a slew of auditions, Stewart makes her film debut in the indie flick The Safety of Objects with Glenn Close and Joshua Jackson. 2002March 20Thrilling PerformanceAt 12, Stewart lands her big break opposite Jodie Foster (right) as a diabetic teen trapped at home during a heist in Panic Room. The thriller nabs the top spot at the box office, grossing more than $30 million in its opening weekend. Stewart's performance impresses critics and earns her a nomination for best lead actress at the Young Artist Awards. "Her approach is very different from most actors," Foster tells Elle. "She's stoic. She keeps it all wrapped up."2005November 01Kid FlicksAfter starring in the caper film Catch That Kid with Corbin Bleu in 2004, Stewart returns to the family film genre in Zathura, based on a book by the author of Jumanji. The space adventure underperforms at the box office, taking in a mere $13 million its opening weekend. 2007MarchOn the RadarA lead role in the supernatural horror movie The Messengers puts Stewart on the cover of Teen Vogue, despite the film's mild success at the box office. Of her newfound fame, Stewart tells the magazine, "Sometimes people come up to me and ask, 'Are you that girl from that movie?' and I say no. I guess that's probably going to get a lot harder to get away with." That year, she also stars in Into the Wild with Emile Hirsch (right) and In the Land of Women with Adam Brody and Meg Ryan.2008July 18Love at First BiteStewart's indie cred earns her the lead in the highly anticipated teen romance drama Twilight–and the cover of EW.  Based on the best-selling book series by Stephenie Meyer, Stewart plays Bella Swan, the love interest of swoon-worthy vampire Edward Cullen (played by Robert Pattinson), and the envy of every teen-lit fan. Stewart's "mixture of innocence and longing just knocked me out," director Catherine Hardwicke tells the magazine. AugustRiding the WaveVanity Fair names Stewart among "Hollywood's New Wave." The actress shares the cover with rising starlets Blake Lively, Amanda Seyfried and Emma Roberts. Stewart, however, is in no rush to join the A-list. "The 'it' girl does all the little fun-loving movies. They're not the kind of movies that I'm into," she tells the Hartford Courant.  November 14The Twilight HypeJust three months after her cover debut, Stewart makes her second EW appearance. In response to the film's hype and the pressure to please fans of the Twilight saga, Stewart says, "I'm sort of the vessel. The book is what it is because of these girls' obsession with [Edward] through me. If I wasn't right, I'd be persecuted, and put on a cross."  November 21Twilight Reigns at Box Office"Twilighters" come out in droves for the film's release, making it the weekend's No. 1 movie with $69.6 million. The movie's monumental success leads Summit Entertainment to green light the onscreen adaptation of Meyer's second Twilight novel, New Moon. "Props to Stewart and Robert Pattinson for playing this uncool-girl-meets-undead-boy story with genuine romantic ardor," raves Rolling Stone. "Stewart brings just the right blend of ferocity and feeling to the role of Bella Swan." 2009August 21The Saga ContinuesStewart lands her third EW cover – this time with her New Moon leading man Taylor Lautner. The sequel, which pulls in a record $258 million worldwide to become the third-largest debut on record, proves to be a challenge for Stewart. "Before the [pivotal breakup scene], I was sitting in my car, like f---ing crying," she says. "Crying so hard you can't breath." Off-screen, reports swirl that Stewart and Pattinson are involved in a real-life romance.  2010JanuaryTaking it OffscreenAlthough they've been coy about their relationship, Stewart and Pattinson privately step out to welcome 2010 together  on an island off the south coast of England. "I'm just trying to keep something," Stewart says of staying mum on her romance. But Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke spills the beans to Time: "I think it took a long time for Kristen to realize, 'OK, I've got to give this a go and really try to be with this person.'"

Kristen Jaymes Stewart was born in Los Angeles, California on April 9th, 1990 to John Stewart and Jules Mann-Stewart.  Kristen’s father, John, works as a stage manager and TV producer for different organizations, most notably FOX.  Her mother, Jules Mann-Stewart, is originally from Australia and works as a script supervisor in Los Angeles.  Kristen also has an older brother, Cameron.
When Kristen was young, her family relocated to Colorado, where they lived for several years before moving back to Los Angeles.  Her acting career began after an agent noticed her performing in a school Christmas play when she was eight years old.  After a non-speaking part in a Disney TV movie, Kristen acted in the role of Sam Jennings in The Safety of Objects.  Shortly after completing this film, Kristen landed the part of Jodie Foster’s daughter in Panic Room (2002).  Then only 12 years old, Kristen was already working with one of the biggest names in Hollywood.  She received praise for her performance in the film, and, as a result, garnered the respect of the Hollywood community and was nominated for a Young Artist Award (for a complete list of Kristen’s feature film roles, please refer to the “Filmography” page).
Since the start of her Hollywood career, Kristen has entertained moviegoers with her impassioned character portrayals, specifically that of Bella Swan (in Twilight).  With multiple projects currently filming or in the production phases, Kristen continues to move forward in her career and look ahead for new opportunities.
Kristen loves reading; additionally, she aspires to go to college for a degree in literature and potentially pursue writing as a career.
=======================================================
                A young actress who isn't afraid to take on gritty roles. She came to fame as Bella Swan in the Twilight series and has recently courted controversy in her private life.Although Kristen Jayne Stewart is best known for her role as Bella Swan in the Twilight saga, she has worked as an actress from a young age and isn't afraid to take on the toughest of roles.  She was born on 9 April 1990 in Los Angeles, California, to parents John and Jules Stewart who also both work in TV and film. Kristen has an older brother called Cameron who now works as a grip. Her mother is a scriptwriter, while her father is a TV producer for Fox.  Perhaps it is no surprise then that Stewart decided to pursue a film career and is now a promising young actress. She went to school until seventh grade after which she continued her education via correspondence and a private tutor.  That's because her career started when she was just eight-years-old. A talent scout saw her performance in a Christmas school play and decided she should be on-screen. Minor roles in The Thirteenth Year (1999) and The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000) followed.  Stewart's first significant role came in 2001 when she was cast as Sam Jennings in The Safety of Objects with Glenn Close. This was then followed by a starring role in Panic Room alongside Jodie Foster in 2002. For the latter performance, Stewart was nominated for a Young Artist Award.  Due to her performance in the aforementioned movie, she was given a role in 2003's Cold Creek Manor as the daughter of Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone. While the film did not perform well at the box office, she received another Young Artist Award nomination. This was followed by parts in Speak, Catch That Kid, Undertow, Fierce People, Zathura and The Messengers, to name just a few.  Her next notable role occurred in 2007 when she starred in Into The Wild, which was a critically acclaimed biopic with Sean Penn. Stewart once again received a Young Artist Award nomination. The same year she appeared in The Cake Eaters.  At the age of just 18, she took on her most famous role as Bella Swan who falls in love with vampire Edward Cullen, who is played by Robert Pattinson. They starred in Twilight in 2008, with the film opening to fans anxious to see the Stephanie Meyer novel brought to life.  She reprised this role in New Moon (2009), The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010), The Twilight Saga – Breaking Dawn Part One (2011) and she is set to star as Bella in The Twilight Saga- Breaking Dawn Part Two later this year.  Not only did these films make Stewart a star, due to the huge following of both the books and movies, she started dating her co-star Pattinson. Notoriously private about their love life, the couple did not reveal much about their relationship but they did move in together.  In terms of her career, Twilight led to roles in the indie film Adventureland in 2009, Welcome To The Rileys in 2010 and gritty roles in The Runaways (2010) and On The Road, which will be released later this year.  This year, Stewart played Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman, which was directed by Rupert Sanders. Rumours of an affair between Stewart and the married director emerged in July this year when photos of the pair together were published.  Stewart issued a statement confirming she had betrayed her boyfriend Pattinson and was deeply sorry for any pain she had caused. Since then she has been criticised in the media, and plans to stay away from the premiere of On the Road. Both R-Pattz and K-Stew have remained silent over the state of their relationship but the Sun reported that Pattinson was selling the home they had shared since September 2011.  There have also been rumours that the couple have been talking once again and will walk the red carpet together when the final instalment of Twilight is released.  Her future after Twilight looks set to be a lucrative one if she can rescue her reputation after her fling with Sanders, with rumours that she will be returning as Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman 2.  She is also set to make a comeback into the limelight in British Vogue's October issue. Stewart graces the cover and speaks about why she struggles to deal with fame. Her lips remained sealed on her current relationship status however.  On fame, she told Vogue: "People expect it to be easy because there you are, out there, doing the thing that you want and making lots of money out of it.   "But, you know, I'm not that smooth. I can get clumsy around certain people. Like if I were to sit down and think, 'OK, I’m really famous, how am I going to conduct myself in public?' I wouldn't know who that person would be!"
