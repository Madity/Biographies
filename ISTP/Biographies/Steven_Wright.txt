Steven Alexander Wright (born December 6, 1955) is an Academy Award winning American comedian, actor and writer. He is known for his distinctly lethargic voice and slow, deadpan delivery of ironic, philosophical and sometimes nonsensical jokes, paraprosdokians, anti-humor, and one-liners with contrived situations.
Wright was born in Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and grew up in Burlington, Massachusetts,[3][4] one of four children of Lucille "Dolly" (née Lomano) and Alexander K. Wright.[3][5][6] He was raised Catholic.[7] His mother was Italian American and his father was of Scottish descent.[8] Wright's father, an electronics technician who "tested a lot of stuff for the Apollo space program," became a truck driver after that program ended.[3]
Wright spent two years obtaining an associate's degree from Middlesex Community College in Bedford, Massachusetts, before enrolling at Emerson College.[9] He graduated from the latter in 1978[9] and began performing stand-up comedy in 1979[3][10] at the Boston comedy club the Comedy Connection.[3][9] He cites George Carlin and Woody Allen among his influences.[11]
In 1982 Peter Lassally, executive producer of The Tonight Show, noticed Wright performing on a bill with other local comics at the comedy club Ding Ho,[12] in Cambridge's Inman Square,[13] a venue Wright described as "half Chinese restaurant and half comedy club. It was a pretty weird place".[3] Lassally booked Wright on The Tonight Show, where the comic so impressed host Johnny Carson and the studio audience that Wright was brought back less than a week later.[11] In May 2000, Wright and other Ding Ho alumni, including Lenny Clarke, Barry Crimmins, Steve Sweeney, Bill Sohonage, and Jimmy Tingle, appeared at a reunion benefit for comic Bob Lazarus, suffering from leukemia.[13]
Wright's 1985 comedy album was entitled I Have a Pony. It was released on Warner Bros. Records, received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. The success of this album landed him an HBO special which he recorded as a live college concert performance, A Steven Wright Special. By now Wright had firmly developed a new brand of obscure, laid-back performing and was rapidly building a cult-like mystique and eclectic following of "hip", savvy fans. His opening act for the HBO concert was fellow "Ding Ho" comedy alumnus Bill Sohonage who recounts that Steven's ultra-casual, nearly catatonic demeanor was no act. "He walked into my dressing room, minutes before I was to take the stage, and asked if he could borrow a shirt, as his had a giant pizza stain. You would think it might be normal to be a little nervous going on a college stage in front of 23,000, let alone having HBO out there filming but as I passed by his room while walking on-stage I saw him sound asleep and loudly snoring". The performance would become one of HBO's longest running and most requested comedy specials and propel him to huge success on the college arena concert circuits.
In 1989 he and fellow producer Dean Parisot won an Academy Award for their 30-minute short film "The Appointments of Dennis Jennings", directed by Parisot, written by Mike Armstrong and Wright, and starring Wright and Rowan Atkinson. Upon accepting the Oscar, Wright said, "Now I'm sorry I cut out that last hour-and-a-half." In 1992 Wright had a recurring role on the television sitcom Mad About You. He supplied the voice of the radio DJ in writer-director Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs that year. "Dean Parisot's wife Sally Menke is Quentin Tarantino's [film] editor, so when she was editing the movie and it was getting down toward the end where they didn't have the radio DJ yet, she thought of me and told Quentin and he liked the idea", Wright explained in 2009.[3]
Numerous lists of jokes attributed to Wright circulate on the Internet, sometimes of dubious origin. Wright has stated, "Someone showed me a site, and half of it that said I wrote it, I didn't write. Recently, I saw one, and I didn't write any of it. What's disturbing is that with a few of these jokes, I wish I had thought of them. A giant amount of them, I'm embarrassed that people think I thought of them, because some are really bad".[14]
After his 1990 comedy special Wicker Chairs and Gravity, Wright continued to do stand-up performances, but he was largely absent from television, only doing occasional guest spots on late-night talk shows. In 1999 he wrote and directed the 30-minute short "One Soldier", "about a soldier who was in the Civil War, right after the war, with all these existentialist thoughts and wondering if there is a God and all that stuff".[3]
In 2006 Wright produced his first stand-up special in 16 years, Steven Wright: When The Leaves Blow Away, originally airing on Comedy Central on October 21, 2006. Its DVD was released April 23, 2007.[citation needed] On September 25, 2007 Wright released his second album, I Still Have a Pony, a CD release of the material from When The Leaves Blow Away. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album but it lost to The Distant Future by Flight of the Conchords.
Steven Wright was awarded an Oscar in 1989 for Best Short Live-Action Film for The Appointments of Dennis Jennings, which he co-wrote (with Michael Armstrong) and starred in.[15]
In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, he was voted amongst the top 50 comedy acts by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. He was named No. 23 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics.[17]
While not well known for works outside of the comedy realm, Steven Wright is also a musician and has also recorded several non-comedy songs with his friend and occasional actor Mark Wuerthner.[18][19] Wright also has an interest in painting.[20]
Beginning in 2009, Steven Wright occasionally appeared on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson as a visiting celebrity, dropping by the show to help with the fan-mail segment. He joins a small cadre of Hollywood celebrities who lend their support to the show in this way.[21][22]

      A friend of mine once sent me a postcard with a picture of the entire planet Earth taken from space. On the back it said 'Wish you were here.'
      I wrote a song, but I can't read music. Every time I hear a new song on the radio I think, 'Hey, maybe I wrote that.'
      I've been doing a lot of abstract painting lately, extremely abstract. No brush, no paint, no canvas, I just think about it.
      I'm constantly tap dancing and wearing bright clothing and talking really loud and smiling all the time. As soon as they can't see me I take off whatever I was wearing, step into my tap shoes, run back stage and turn the music on. - on what he's like off-stage

=======================================================
Born in New York City, Steven Wright grew up in Boston. As a teenager, he enjoyed staying up late to watch The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson, especially when comedians were featured. He decided he wanted to be a comedian too, but was afraid to admit it out loud. Instead, he attended Boston's Emerson College, graduating with a degree in mass communications. 
He decided to finally give comedy a try at the age of 23, when he attended an open mike night at a Boston comedy club. His dry humor, delivered with a poker face in a monotone, was a hit. When he was invited to appear on The Tonight Show in 1982, he knew his dream had come true. Wright was so well received that he was asked to come back the following week, and soon found himself making appearances on other comedy/late night talk shows such as Saturday Night Live and Late Night with David Letterman. His debut album, I Have a Pony, was nominated for a Grammy in 1986.
Also in 1986, he made his motion picture debut in Desperately Seeking Susan, starring Madonna. The following year he appeared in a short film he wrote with Roberto Benigni and Jim Jarmusch, entitled Coffee and Cigarettes. Jarmusch went on to create two other shorts in the same vein and eventually decided to incorporate them into a feature length film by the same title, which was released in 2004. Wright was awarded an Oscar in 1989 for Best Live Action Short Film for The Appointments of Dennis Jennings, which he co-wrote with Michael Armstrong and starred in as the title role.
From 1992 to 1994, Wright played Warren Harharman on the hit sitcom Mad About You, starring Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser. He also continued to appear in feature films such as Natural Born Killers (1994) starring Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis; Canadian Bacon (1995) starring John Candy and Alan Alda; The Muse (1999) starring Sharon Stone and Albert Brooks; and Loser (2000), starring Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari. 
Multi-talented, Wright also plays guitar and writes songs, is a talented painter, has written two short films and has had a fiction story published in Rolling Stone Magazine. 
After years of living in New York and Los Angeles, Wright moved back to Boston in 2002. A Red Sox fan, he enjoys attending baseball games in his spare time. He continues to perform stand up comedy, and recently completed a tour that included Las Vegas and several other American cities as well as England and Ireland.

Jim Jarmusch's quirky ensemble comedy is presented as a series of vignettes that all revolve around discussions held over coffee and cigarettes.
Series host David Steinberg interviews the dryly funny comics whose wickedly smart, subversive observations and twisted takes on the absurdities of everyday life and popular culture have made them household names.
The comedy stakes are high when Space Ghost, Moltar, Zorak and guest Steven Wright are stalked by body-snatching pods. Show producers auctioned off the ending of this episode on eBay.
Larry and the staff try to identify the guest who got Beverly pregnant; Hank moves in with a Wisconsin family for a week.

Paul Provenza is a seasoned comedy veteran. From stand-up to acting in sitcoms and movies, he's no stranger to the funny bone. So it's not surprising that his directorial debut — a meditation on one unbelievably dirty joke — garnered some serious attention at last year's Sundance Film Festival. The Aristocrats, arriving in stores today on DVD, is a who's who of comedy's finest — from George Carlin to Robin Williams to Jon Stewart to Whoopi Goldberg, and the list goes on and on. Provenza spoke with TVGuide.com about the movie and about one particular telling of The Aristocrats that has gone down in Hollywood lore.

"I grew up in a world of unpredictability and violence. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal and to cover my fear with anger and violence." Raised on Fear is a true story by Lee Cox. A self healing, must-read. Buy today and get free shipping.
From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders. Contact the EVE Foundation to have Lee speak at your next event.
