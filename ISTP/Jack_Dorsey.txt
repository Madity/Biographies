Jack Dorsey (born November 19, 1976) is an American web developer and businessman widely known as a co-founder and co-creator of Twitter, Fleetic and as the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company.[3] In 2008, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[4] For 2012, The Wall Street Journal gave him the "Innovator of the Year Award" for technology.[5]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri,[6][7] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[8][9][10] He is of part Italian descent.[11] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[12] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age thirteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[8] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, where he first came up with the idea that became Twitter.[13] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[14][15]
In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[16] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[16] In July 2000, building on dispatching[8] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and possibly by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[16]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[8] He approached Odeo, who at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[8] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[8] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[8] who had left Google after selling it Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[8][17] In his role during the pivotal days of the company's founding, a compilation chronicling the originally named "twttr" and the time leading up to the official launch, is shown in a timeline of tweets revealing Twitter's beginnings.[18] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[19] On October 16, 2008,[20] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[21][22] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[23]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[24] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[25] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[25] His three guiding principles, which are shared by the whole company and through its culture, are simplicity, constraint, and craftsmanship.[25]
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe her or his card, choose an amount to give to the recipient and then sign his or her name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[26][27] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[28] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[29] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[30] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[31]
Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[32] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[33] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[33] Dorsey served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[34]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[35]

Jack Dorsey is an American entrepreneur and businessman famed for development of Twitter and the creator and chief executive officer of Square. In 2012, he bagged the ‘Innovator of the Year Award’ by the Wall Street Journal.
Dorsey was born on 19th November 1976 in Fairmont City, Illinois. He attended the Catholic High School at Bishop DuBourg High School and  enrolled in the Missouri University of Science and Technology but later transferred to New York University where he first got the idea of Twitter. At the young age of 15, he wrote dispatch software which is still used by many cab companies. ‘The King of Tweets’ as he is popularly known initiated a company that dispatched taxis, couriers and emergency services from the internet in 2000. His other ideas included the ‘frictionless service market’ and networks of medical devices. In July of 2000, Dorsey came up with the idea of a web-based realtime status or short message communication service. He was inspired by LiveJournal and maybe AOL messenger. He teamed up with Christopher Isaac “Biz” stone and in two weeks’ time came up with a Twitter prototype. Originally named ‘twttr’, Twitter Inc. was set up in 2006 and is now one of the most widely used social networking website all over the world. Jack Dorsey was the first person to post a tweet on Twitter which said ‘just setting up my twttr’. Dorsey was selected the chief executive officer of the company.
Twitter was at first derided as a time wasting tool and platform for self-centered people who cared to broadcast every minute of their lives. It was even mocked by the comedy host of a late night show Conan O’Brien in his segment ‘Twitter Tracker’. But soon Twitter became widely popular amongst celebrities and business personalities and soon it became a powerful platform for Presidents and political people like Barack Obama and John McCain on which they could keep their supporters up to date. The website reached new heights of success during the Iranian presidential elections in 2009. When the government blocked cell phone messages and foreign news coverage, thousands of Iranian protestors posted tweets on live status updates. By 2010 Twitter had more than 105 million users who posted almost 55 million times a day. Apart from Twitter,  Jack Dorsey also invested in another social networking company called Foursquare. He established Square in May 2010 which is a business platform where debit and credit card payments can be accepted and paperless receipts can be sent through e mail and text messaging. According to an estimate by the Business Insider magazine the company was worth $3.2 billion in September 2012.
Jack Dorsey has proved his supremacy in entrepreneurship through his wisely chosen business ventures. He uses his three traits of simplicity, craftsmanship and constraint to run his businesses. His love of dispatch routing made him one of the richest people of the world. As of March 2013, his net worth is $1.1 billion. Even though Twitter has already brought a huge change in the way people communicate, for Dorsey this is not the end.

He went on to start Square after he left Twitter, which offered a mobile payments solution that allowed vendors to charge consumers with their iPhone. 
He and his fellow Twitter executives turned down an offer from Mark Zuckerberg to purchase Twitter early on.
