=======================================================
Jenna Jameson (born Jenna Marie Massoli; April 9, 1974)[3][4] is an American entrepreneur, webcam model and former pornographic film actress,[5] who has been called the world's most famous adult-entertainment performer[6][7][8] and "The Queen of Porn".[9] She started acting in erotic videos in 1993 after having worked as a stripper and glamor model. By 1996, she had won the "top newcomer" award from each of the three major adult-movie organizations. She has since won more than 20 adult-video awards, and has been inducted into the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO) and Adult Video News (AVN) Halls of Fame.[10][11]
Jameson founded the adult-entertainment company ClubJenna in 2000 with Jay Grdina, whom she later married and divorced. Initially a single website, this business expanded into managing similar websites of other stars and began producing sexually explicit videos in 2001. The first such movie, Briana Loves Jenna (with Briana Banks), was named at the 2003 AVN Awards as the best-selling and best-renting pornographic title for 2002.[12] By 2005, ClubJenna had revenues of US$30 million with profits estimated at half that.[6] Advertisements for her site and films, often bearing her picture, have towered on a 48-foot-tall billboard in New York City's Times Square.[13]
Jameson has also crossed over into mainstream pop culture, starting with a minor role in Howard Stern's 1997 film Private Parts.[8] Her mainstream appearances continued with several guest-hosting and guest-starring on various television programs. Playboy TV hosted her Jenna's American Sex Star reality show, in which aspiring porn stars competed for a ClubJenna contract.[14] Her 2004 autobiography, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale, spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.[6]
Jameson announced her retirement from pornography at the 2008 AVN Awards, stating that she would never return to the industry.[15] Although she no longer performs in pornographic films, she has been working as a webcam model on MyFreeCams.com since 2013.[5]
Jenna Marie Massoli was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her father, Laurence Henry Massoli, was a police officer at the Las Vegas Sheriff's Department and program director for KSNV-DT. Her mother, Judith Brooke Hunt, was a Las Vegas showgirl who danced in the Folies Bergère show at the Tropicana Resort & Casino.[1][16] Her mother died of melanoma on February 20, 1976, two months prior to her daughter's second birthday.[4] The cancer treatments bankrupted the family and they relocated in Nevada, Arizona, and Montana, usually living in a trailer home or living with her paternal grandmother. She has an older brother, Tony.[17] She was a frequent entrant in beauty pageants as a child, and enrolled in ballet classes throughout her childhood.[18] In a featurette on the Zombie Strippers DVD, Jameson indicates she trained in dance for fifteen years.
Jameson writes in her autobiography that in October 1990, when she was 16 years old and while the family was living on a cattle ranch in Fromberg, Montana, she was beaten with rocks and gang raped by four boys after a football game at Fromberg High School.[17] The incident began after she attempted to hitchhike home, and that she entered the car of the four boys while believing that she would be driven to her home.[17] She reported being raped a second time while still 16, by "Preacher," her boyfriend Jack's biker uncle.[17] Preacher has denied the rape ever occurred.[19] Rather than tell her father, she left home and moved in with Jack in her first serious relationship.[4][20]
Jack was a tattoo artist, and gave her the first of a series of tattoos, one of which would become her trademark tattoo, two hearts on her right buttock.[6] According to E!, her brother Tony, who later owned a tattoo parlor himself,[1] added the inscription "Heart Breaker."[1][4]
She tried to follow in her mother's career as a Las Vegas showgirl, but most shows rejected her for not having the then-typical height of 5 feet 8 inches (173 cm).[12][21] She was hired at Disneyland Resort,[1] but left after two months stating concerns over the schedule and salary schedule.[20]
Her boyfriend Jack encouraged her to apply for jobs as a dancer,[7] and in 1991, though underage, she began dancing in Las Vegas strip clubs using a fake identification.[4][18] After she was rejected from the Crazy Horse Too strip club because of her orthodontia, she removed her braces with pliers and was accepted.[6] After six months, she was earning US$2,000 per night, before graduating from Bonanza High School.[4]
Her first stage name as a dancer was "Jennasis",[16] which she later used as the name of a business that she incorporated ("Jennasis Killing Co.").[22] She chose the name "Jenna Jameson" to use as a model after scrolling through the phone book for a last name that matched her first name, before finally deciding on Jameson after the whiskey, which she is known to drink.[4][23]
Besides dancing, starting later in 1991, she posed for nude photographs for photographer Suze Randall in Los Angeles, with the intention of getting into Penthouse.[20][24] After her photos had appeared in several men's magazines under various names, she then stopped working for Randall, feeling Randall was "a shark"[25] who had been taking advantage of her.[26]
While in high school, she began taking drugs – cocaine, LSD, and methamphetamine – accompanied by her brother (who was addicted to heroin[1]) and at times her father.[17] Her addiction worsened during her four years with her boyfriend. She eventually stopped eating properly and became too thin to model; Jack left her in 1994. She weighed 76 pounds (34 kg)[27] when a friend put her in a wheelchair and sent her to her father, who was then living in Redding, California, in order to detox; her father did not recognize her when she got off the plane.[17]
Jameson says that she started acting in pornographic videos in retaliation for the infidelity of her boyfriend, Jack.[6][20] She first appeared in an erotic film in 1993, a non-explicit softcore movie by Andrew Blake,[28] with girlfriend Nikki Tyler,[12] whom she had met modeling for Suze Randall.[26] Her first pornographic movie scenes were filmed by Randy West and appeared in 1994's Up and Cummers 10 and Up and Cummers 11.[18][29] She quickly achieved notice and appeared in several other pornographic films while still living in Las Vegas.
Of her first pornographic movie, Randy West said "Jenna contacted me and said she wanted to get into the XXX business, but her agent didn't want her to do porn. A month later I'm on a shoot in Woodland Hills [a San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles], and there's Jenna. She said she wanted to get into the business, despite what her agent said. I told her if you want to just do a girl/girl scene, we can do that. She said she wanted to work with Kylie Ireland, so I set it up. When the sex started, she just fucking rocked! I knew Jenna was special right off the bat. I figured she'd be the next Ginger Lynn, but nobody had any idea she was going to be as big as she turned out to be. Jenna told me when we first met that she was going to be a star."[30]
Jameson got her first breast implants on July 28, 1994, to enhance her stripping and movie careers.[31] By 2004, she had had two different sets of breast implants and a chin implant.[1][32]
Jameson's first pornographic film appearances were lesbian scenes (a common way that female performers ease into the business). She says: "Girl-on-girl was easy and natural. Then they offered me lots of money to do boy-girl."[12] Her first heterosexual scene was in Up and Cummers 11 (1994).[33] At the beginning of her career, she promised herself that she would never do anal sex or double penetration scenes on film.[7] Instead, her "signature move" was oral sex, lubricated with saliva.[34][35] She has also never done any interracial sex scenes with men (despite that category's runaway popularity during 2000s).[36] When asked about this on The Howard Stern Show on February 8, 2008, she said that she was not necessarily opposed to doing so; rather, "it never really came up", as there were few black men working in porn when she started, and none of them worked [exclusively] for the same company [as] she did.[37]
In 1994, after overcoming her drug addiction by spending several weeks with her father and grandmother, Jameson relocated to Los Angeles to live with Nikki Tyler.[26][38] Her first movie after that was Silk Stockings.[39] Later in 1995, Wicked Pictures, a then small pornographic film production company, signed her to an exclusive contract.[6][40] She remembers telling Wicked Pictures founder Steve Orenstein: "The most important thing to me right now is to become the biggest star the industry has ever seen."[17][25]
The contract earned Jameson US$6,000 for each of eight movies in her first year.[4] Her first big-budget production was Blue Movie (1995), where she played a reporter investigating a porn set; it won multiple AVN Awards.[18] In 1996, Jameson won top awards from three major industry organizations, the XRCO Best New Starlet award, the AVN Best New Starlet Award, and the Fans of X-Rated Entertainment (F.O.X.E.) Video Vixen award. She was the first entertainer to win all three awards.[18] A stream of other awards followed.
By 2001, Jameson earned $60,000 for a day and a half of filming a single DVD, and $8,000 per night dancing at strip clubs. She tried to restrict herself to five films per year and two weeks of dancing per month.[41] Her husband Jay Grdina has said that she earned as much as $25,000 per night dancing.[8]
Between 2005 and 2006, she hosted Playboy TV's Jenna's American Sex Star, where prospective porn stars compete in sexual performances for a contract with her company, ClubJenna. Winners of the contracts for the first two years were Brea Bennett and Roxy Jezel.[42]
In August 2007, Jameson had her breast implants removed, reducing her from a D to a C cup; she also said she was finished with appearing on camera in pornographic films, though she would continue running ClubJenna, which was grossing $30 million per year.[43] In January 2008, Jameson confirmed she was retiring from pornographic performances[44] and has since said that she "won't even do a Maxim cover."[45]
Jameson's first appearance at an adult-entertainment event since her retirement was at the 2013 Exxxotica New Jersey convention in October.[46] The following month, she returned to the adult industry as a webcam model.[47] On January 15, 2014, Fleshlight released Jameson's signature artificial vagina.[48] Jameson was also the master of ceremonies for the 2014 XBIZ Awards on January 24.[49]
Jameson and Grdina formed ClubJenna as an Internet pornography company in 2000. ClubJenna.com was one of the first pornographic sites to provide more than pictures and videos; it provided explicit diaries, relationship advice, and even stock tips to paid members. The site reportedly was profitable in its third week. The business later diversified into multimedia pornographic entertainment, first by administering other porn stars' websites, then, in 2001, by production of pornographic films.[6]
Early ClubJenna films starred Jameson herself, limiting herself to on-screen sex with other women or with Grdina, who appeared as Justin Sterling. The first ClubJenna film, Briana Loves Jenna (2001), co-produced with Vivid, cost US$280,000 to make, and grossed over $1 million in its first year. It was the best selling and best renting pornographic title of its year, winning twin AVN Awards.[6][50] It was marketed as "Jenna. Her first boy/girl scene in over 2 years." referring to Jameson's abstention from heterosexual on-film intercourse. Grdina has said that Jameson's films averaged sales of 100,000 copies, compared with run-of-the-mill pornographic films, which did well to sell 5,000. On the other hand, he also said that their films took up to twelve days to film, compared with one day for other pornographic films.[8]
In a January 2009 interview with William Shatner on Shatner's Raw Nerve, Jameson said she came close to buying Penthouse magazine when publisher Bob Guccione filed for Chapter 11 reorganization of his business (which occurred in August 2003), but was thwarted when someone else swooped in and bought up all the stock.[51] New York Magazine's Intelligencer quoted a source from Penthouse as saying "I'm sure she is considering it", adding that Jameson was to be cover girl in January 2004 – and "it's a really wild-looking shoot, even for a porn star."[52]
In 2004, the ClubJenna films expanded to starring other actresses without Jameson – Krystal Steal, Jesse Capelli, McKenzie Lee, Ashton Moore and Sophia Rossi – as Jameson stepped back from starring roles.[6] In 2005 Jameson first directed a film, The Provocateur, released as Jenna's Provocateur in September 2006.[53] The ClubJenna films were distributed and marketed by Vivid Entertainment, which Forbes magazine once called "the world's largest adult film company."[6] They made up a third of ClubJenna's revenues, but over half of the profits.[6]
ClubJenna was run as a family business, with Grdina's sister, Kris, as Vice President in charge of merchandising.[1][54] In 2005, ClubJenna had estimated revenues of $30 million, with profits of about half that.[6]
Jameson also capitalized on merchandising herself. Since May 2003, she has been appearing on a 48-foot (15 m) tall billboard in New York City's Times Square promoting her web site and movies.[1][50] The first advertisement displayed her wearing only a thong and read "Who Says They Cleaned Up Times Square?"[55][56] There is a line of sex toys licensed to Doc Johnson, and an "anatomically correct" Jenna Jameson action figure.[6][17] She stars in her own sex simulation video game, Virtually Jenna, in which the goal is to bring a 3D model of her to orgasm.[57][58] Y-Tell, ClubJenna's wireless company, sells Jenna Jameson "moan tones" (telephone ringtones), chat services, and games in partnerships with 20 carriers around the world, mostly in Europe and South America.[6] In 2006, New York City-based Wicked Cow Entertainment started to expand her brand to barware, perfume, handbags, lingerie, and footwear, sold through high eend retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Colette boutiques.[59] Her film and merchandising success enabled her to attain her goal of becoming the top porn star in the world.[60]
In August 2005, ClubJenna launched Club Thrust, an interactive website for Jameson's gay male fans, which includes videos, galleries, sex advice, gossip, and downloads. The director of webmaster relations for ClubJenna said the straight site had always had a lot of gay traffic.[61][62] By 2006, ClubJenna administered more than 150 official sites for other adult-entertainment industry stars.[54]
In August 2005, a group of business investors that included Jameson purchased Babes Cabaret, a strip club in Scottsdale, Arizona, intending to make it the first foray of ClubJenna into live entertainment.[63] Soon after the purchase attracted attention, the Scottsdale City Council proposed a new ordinance banning nudity at adult-entertainment venues and requiring a four-foot divider restricting contact with dancers. Such a divider would have also effectively banned lap dances, the dancers' main source of revenue.[64][65] Jameson argued strongly against the ordinance, and helped organize a petition against it. On September 12, 2006, in a referendum on the ordinance, voters struck down the stricter rules, allowing the club to continue to operate as before.[66]
On February 3, 2006, Jameson hosted a "Vivid ClubJenna Super Bowl Party" with several other ClubJenna and Vivid Girls at the Zoo Club in Detroit, Michigan for a $500 to $1,000 ticket price.[67] It featured a lingerie show, but no planned nudity or sex acts.[68] When first announced, the party caused controversy with the National Football League, which did not sanction this as an official Super Bowl event.[69] For 2007, Jameson signed up to play quarterback in the Lingerie Bowl, but retired due to her insurance company's damage concerns. She instead acted as commentator.[70]
On June 22, 2006, Playboy Enterprises announced that it had bought ClubJenna Inc., along with an agreement to have both Jameson and Grdina stay on as contracted executives. Playboy CEO Christie Hefner said that she expected to rapidly increase film production, producing about thirty features in the first year, and will expand the way they are sold, not only as DVDs but through TV channels, video-on-demand services and mobile phones.[71] On November 1, 2006, Playboy renamed one of the Spice Network's pay-per-view channels from The Hot Network to ClubJenna.[72]
In April 2007, Tera Patrick and her production company Teravision filed a lawsuit against Jameson and Playboy Enterprises for failing to properly account for and pay royalties on revenue earned by Patrick's website, clubtera.com.[73]
Jameson's autobiography, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale was published in 2003. It was co-written with Neil Strauss, a contributor to The New York Times and Rolling Stone, and published by ReganBooks, a division of HarperCollins. It was an instant bestseller, spending six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.[6] The autobiography also won the 2004 "Mainstream's Adult Media Favorite" XRCO Award in a tie with Seymore Butts's Family Business TV series. It was translated into German as Pornostar. Die Autobiographie in November 2005,[74] and Spanish as Cómo Hacer El Amor Igual Que Una Estrella Porno in January 2006.[75]
The book covers her early career from her beginning in show business living with her tattoo artist boyfriend, through receiving the Pornographic Hot d'Or award at Cannes, and wedding pictures from her second marriage.[76] It does not omit sordid details, describing her two rapes, drug addictions, an unhappy first marriage, and numerous affairs with men and women.[25] The first-person narrative is broken up by personal photos, childhood diary entries, family interviews, movie scripts, and comic panels.[77]
The autobiography publisher, Judith Regan, also served as executive producer of a tie-in television news special, Jenna Jameson's Confessions,[78] airing on VH1 on August 16, 2004, one day before the book's launch.[79] In April 2005, ReganBooks and Jameson filed lawsuits against each other. The point of contention was a proposed reality show about Jameson's everyday life, discussed between her then-husband, Jay Grdina, and the A&E Network. ReganBooks maintained that any A&E deal was a breach of Jameson's contract, which indicated that ReganBooks had a stake in the profits generated by both the special based on her memoir and a reality-based series, as well as "any similar projects."[80] Jameson's suit claimed that the A&E deal preceded the ReganBooks contract.[81] The reality series had still not materialized, and the lawsuit was still being discussed, when HarperCollins fired Judith Regan on December 15, 2006, over an unrelated issue.[82]
In January 2007, Jameson was reported in talks with producers on turning the autobiography into a movie. In March 2007, Jameson was reportedly missing meetings with producers, thus endangering the movie, due to problems with a recent vaginoplasty.[83][84]
In April 2013, Jameson announced she was working on a fictional erotic novel called Sugar. It was co-written with Hope Tarr and published by Skyhorse Publishing. It was released on October 21, 2013.[85]
Jameson is also known for achieving a high level of celebrity outside of pornography – even bringing pornography itself closer to mainstream society's awareness and acceptance.[18][25][59] She has said: "I've always embraced my hard-core roots, but becoming a household name was an important thing to me."[6]
In 1995, Jameson sent photos of herself to radio host Howard Stern.[4] She became a regular guest on his show, appearing more than 30 times,[6] and played the role of "Mandy", the "First Nude Woman on Radio", in Stern's semi-autobiographical 1997 film Private Parts.[86][87] This film appearance was the beginning of a series of non-porn film and television roles. In 1997, Jameson made an appearance for an Extreme Championship Wrestling pay-per-view, Hardcore Heaven '97 as the valet for the Dudley family; another appearance at ECW Living Dangerously on March 1, 1998; and a few months where she was ECW's on-screen interviewer.[88] In 1998, she filmed a vignette with Val Venis, a character in the WWE, for airing on WWE programming. In the late 1990s, Jameson guest hosted several episodes of the E! cable network's hit travel/adventure/party show Wild On!, appearing scantily clad in tropical locations.[4][12] Jameson was featured and interviewed on the British television show "European Blue Review" on Channel 5.[89]
Jameson appeared in a 2001 music video for the Eminem song "Without Me."[90] She can be seen in bed with Eminem as one of the "two trailer park girls" that "go round the outside."[91] Jameson voiced an animated version of herself in a July 2001 episode of Family Guy entitled "Brian Does Hollywood". Her character won an award for acting in a porn film directed by Brian Griffin, and at the close of the episode Peter Griffin kidnaps her. In 2002, Jameson and Ron Jeremy played themselves in Comedy Central's first feature television movie Porn 'n Chicken, in the roles of speakers for a pornography viewing club.[92] Also in 2002, she appeared in two video games, most notably voicing Candy Suxxx in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Her character begins as a prostitute, but goes on to success as a pornographic actress and is displayed on several billboards within the game. Her performance won the 2003 G-Phoria "Best Live Action/Voice Performance Award – Female".[93] She also provided both the appearance and the voice for "Daisy", a secret playable character for the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, who performs provocative tricks with her clothing and skateboard.[94] In 2003, Jameson appeared in two episodes of the NBC prime time television show Mister Sterling as the girlfriend of a political financier.[12][50]
In the months following the publication of her autobiography, she was interviewed on NBC, CNBC, Fox News, and CNN,[8] and the book was reviewed by The New York Times, Reuters, and other major media outlets.[76][77]
Jameson was featured prominently in Samhain, a low budget horror film in which she starred with other pornographic actresses including Ginger Lynn Allen. It was filmed in 2002, but had sat unreleased until 2005, when it was re-cut and released as Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain.[95] She had another minor horror film role in Sin-Jin Smyth, delayed from release until late 2006.[96]
In February 2006, Comedy Central announced plans to feature Jameson as "P-Whip", in a starring role in its first animated mobile phone series, Samurai Love God.[92][97] Mediaweek called her the biggest name attached to the project.[98] In April 2006, Jameson was the star of a video podcast ad for Adidas, advertising Adicolor shoes by playing a provocative game of whack a mole.[99] In July 2006, Jameson became the first pornographic actress to have a wax model at Madame Tussauds (in the Las Vegas museum).[100] Jameson made an appearance in the U.S. reality TV show The Simple Life in the fifth season episode "Committed", broadcast on July 1, 2007; Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, while working in a "love camp", brought her in to help throw a "love ceremony" vow for the five dysfunctional couples. In 2008 Jameson had another starring role in the comedy horror film Zombie Strippers, loosely based on Eugène Ionesco's classic play Rhinoceros.[101]
Some of her mainstream appearances sparked controversy. An interview with Jameson contained in the 1999 Abercrombie & Fitch A&F Quarterly was part of the motivation for Michigan Attorney General Jennifer Granholm and Illinois Lieutenant Governor Corinne Wood to speak out against the hybrid magazine-catalog.[102] The campaign was joined by parents and Christian conservative groups, and got the Quarterly removed from shelves and eventually canceled in 2003.[103]
In November 2001, the Oxford Union debating society invited Jameson to come to Oxford to argue against the proposition "The House Believes that Porn is Harmful."[34] She wrote in her diary at the time, "I feel like I am going to be out of my element, but, I could never pass this chance up ... it's a once in a lifetime thing."[104] In the end, her side won the debate 204 to 27.[12]
In February 2003, Pony International planned to feature her as one of several pornographic actors in advertisements for athletic shoes. This was attacked by Bill O'Reilly of Fox News in an editorial called "Using Quasi-Prostitutes to Sell Sneakers", calling pornographic actors inappropriate role models for teens.[105] In response, The Harvard Crimson proposed a boycott of O'Reilly and Fox News.[106] Jameson herself sent a sarcastic email to the show, writing:
I hope Bill understands the difference between a porn star and a hooker. I assume he has done some research on the subject because he requested some of my videos after we finished taping my appearance. I imagine he wanted them for professional reasons.[107]
In 2004 Jameson stated that she was bisexual, and that she had had sex with 100 women and 30 men off-screen in her life,[7] but by 2008 she described herself as "totally hetero."[134] She has stated the best relationship she ever had was her lesbian relationship with porn actress Nikki Tyler, which she documents in her autobiography. They lived together at the start of her porn career and again before her second marriage.[12][18] Famous boyfriends discussed in her autobiography include Marilyn Manson[135] and Tommy Lee.[4][12][36]
On December 20, 1996, Jameson married porn star/Wicked Pictures director Brad Armstrong (real name Rodney Hopkins).[4][18] The marriage lasted just 10 weeks. Although they informally separated in March 1997, she remained contractually obligated to work on Wicked Pictures projects involving both of them. They legally separated and divorced in March 2001, after Brad discovered her sexual affair with Jorge Araya Montoya (whom she met on a visit to Costa Rica).[4]
In the summer of 1998, Jameson met former pornographic studio owner Jay Grdina (born John G. Grdina),[54] scion of a wealthy cattle-ranching family, who had entered pornographic film production after college.[6][136] From 1998 until Jameson's retirement, Grdina was Jameson's only on-screen male sex partner, acting under the name Justin Sterling. They were engaged in December 2000, well before her divorce from Armstrong/Hopkins,[4] and married June 22, 2003.[1] They tried to have children from mid-2004 onwards, as Jameson had planned to retire from adult entertainment upon becoming a mother.[6][7][9] The couple resided in Scottsdale, Arizona, in a 6,700-square-foot (620 m2) Spanish-style mansion, bought for $2 million in 2002.[1]
In November 2004, Jameson was diagnosed with skin cancer. Though surgery removed it, she miscarried shortly after the diagnosis. She was unable to conceive again with Grdina, even with in vitro fertilization. Jameson said the in vitro process "wasn't a good thing for me"; she gained weight and did not get pregnant. According to Jameson, the stresses of the cancer plus infertility led to her marriage's collapse.[137] In August 2006, Star magazine and TMZ.com confirmed with Jameson's publicist that she and Grdina had separated.[138][139]
In October 2006, it was reported that Jameson began dating mixed martial artist and former UFC champion Tito Ortiz,[140] whom she met on Myspace.[141] Ortiz canceled a November 12, 2006 appearance as the guest of honor at the United States Marine Corps birthday ball at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, when the Corps refused to let him bring Jameson as his guest.[142][143] On November 30, 2006, in an interview on The Howard Stern Show, Ortiz stated that he was in love with Jameson, that she was no longer acting in pornography, and that they were in a monogamous relationship.[144] On December 12, 2006, Jameson filed for divorce from Grdina.[145] She introduced Ortiz and talked about their relationship at the 2008 AVN Adult Movie Awards while she was presenting an award. She also made brief appearances on two episodes of The Celebrity Apprentice to help Ortiz on the tasks assigned in those episodes.
Jameson announced in August 2008 that she and Ortiz were expecting twins in April 2009.[146] On March 16, 2009, Jameson gave birth to twin boys, Jesse Jameson and Journey Jette.[147][148]
Jameson began extensive tattoos in early 2014 with sleeves covering both arms.[149] Jameson has stated on Instagram that she intends to cover her back with tattoos once her sleeve has been fully completed.[150] She has attributed the reason for her growing number of tattoos as an expression of her true identity rather than being "made into a Barbie".[151]
After viewing undercover videos of chicken production, Jameson agreed to do a short video for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals as part of the group's campaign against KFC's treatment of chickens.[152]
Jameson supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 United States presidential election,[153][154] but Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 United States presidential election, stating: "I'm very looking forward to a Republican being back in office. When you're rich, you want a Republican in office."[155]
On April 26, 2010, Ortiz was arrested for felony domestic abuse at the couple's Huntington Beach, California home.[156] Jameson was photographed afterward that day with a bandaged arm,[156] amid accusations by both parties against each other, with Ortiz accusing Jameson of being erratic and addicted to OxyContin, while she alleged that he was abusive. Since the incident occurred, both parties have recanted these allegations that were made toward one another, though as of April 29, 2010, the investigation by the police department remained open.[157]
On May 25, 2012, Jameson was arrested in Westminster, California and charged with three misdemeanor counts for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, driving with a blood-alcohol level over the state legal limit, and driving on a suspended license after her Range Rover struck a light pole. She initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, but later changed her plea to guilty. She was sentenced to three years of informal probation, ordered to pay $340 in fines, and participate in a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victims' impact panel. The charge for driving without a valid license was dismissed.[158][159]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Jenna Jameson was born and raised in Las Vegas by her father, and by the time she was 18 the bright lights were already drawing her in. She studied ballet, but it was stripping that started her on her road to superstardom. Dancing led to nude modeling, and by her 20th birthday she had appeared in dozens of top men's mags, including "Penthouse", "Hustler", "High Society" and "Cheri". A visit to a porn set piqued her interest in a hardcore career, and Wicked Pictures signed her to an exclusive contract after a bidding war. It took only a few releases for Jenna to become the most popular young starlet around. She catapulted to the top of the porn heap, and in 1996 she scored an unprecedented triple crown by taking home the XRCO Best New Starlet, the F.O.X.E. Video Vixen and the AVN Best New Starlet awards. Jenna has been branching out into more mainstream projects lately, including a featured role in Howard Stern's Private Parts (1997). She remains one of the most popular pornstresses in the industry today.
      Her father Larry Massoli is a retired police officer. Her late mother Judith Brooke Massoli (née Hunt) was a showgirl. Both worked in Las Vegas, Nevada.
      Her only sibling, a brother Tony Massoli is three years older and owns a tattoo parlor in Tempe, Arizona where he lives with his wife and child.
      Her mother was diagnosed with melanoma and died shortly afterwards on February 20, 1976. Before her illness, she had been a showgirl at the Tropicana and the Folies Bergère in Las Vegas.
      After deciding to change her last name, Jenna came across Jameson in the phone book and settled once her brother approved saying "I'm drinking Jameson right now".
      She wrote (with Neil Strauss) a book about her life, "How To Make Love Like A Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale", that became a bestseller.
      Gave birth to twin sons (her first and second child) at age 34, Jesse Jameson Ortiz and Journey Jette Ortiz on March 15, 2009. Children's father is her boyfriend, Tito Ortiz.
      In November 2004, when Jenna was pregnant with her first child by her second husband, Justin Sterling, she was diagnosed with skin cancer, from which her mother died. Despite the successful operation to remove a tumor, Jameson suffered a miscarriage. Later, she was unable to get pregnant again even with IVF. On the basis of this, and other problems, she and her husband were separated in August 2006 and divorced in June 2007.
      Release of her book, "How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale" by Jenna with Neil Strauss.
      I try my hardest to push the point that I am a feminist. I really think it's important that people know that the women in this industry are empowered. They run it, man. It's awesome.
      [in response to a question at the 2003 X-Rated Critics Organization Awards] Is it just me, or is a porn award show just not the right place to be discussing your thoughts on the war?
      The funny thing about being a porn star is that everyone automatically assumes that they can sleep with you. This is what I do for a living. I don't just let anyone get into my pants.
      Making eye contact during rough sex is roughly the equivalent trying to read [Fyodor Dostoevsky] on a rollercoaster.
      I don't know exactly what I'm going to say to my sons, but I do know that I want them to understand that their mother loves them. I don't worry about what people think. I worry about what my sons think.

"The sex scenes [involving myself] are hard to watch. Only because it's strange to see your private parts that big." - Jenna Jameson
                Basically, Jenna Jameson has become the public face of porn, which means that she is the top interview choice when the mainstream media (everyone from CNN to FOX) does a story on the multibillion-dollar porn industry. The 2004 publication of her book, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, and the tie-in television news special on VH1, Jenna Jameson's Confessions, legitimized Jenna Jameson even further.            
                Sex is Jenna Jameson's business, and business sure is good for this buxom blonde. Naturally, having appeared in a wide range of videos and photo spreads, she hasn't left much to the imagination -- but few seem to mind that.  Here's a good example of just how revered Jenna's physique is: Her company, ClubJenna, offers an accurate and lifelike mold of her pelvic region for $179.95. Only a handful of the world's women are hot enough to make such a product fly, and Jenna can't keep them in stock.            
                Jenna Jameson has done a ton of films, but in our opinion, some of her best work has been: Jenna's Revenge (1996), Philmore Butts Taking Care of Business (1997), The Masseuse (2004), and The New Devil in Miss Jones (2006). But it's porn, so every guy probably has his own personal favorite from her repertoire of over 80 movies.  With over a decade in the business, there's little left for Jenna Jameson to accomplish in porn. She's already received numerous industry lifetime achievement awards. Though she confirmed her retirement in January 2008, Jenna Jameson has accomplished what only those at the top of their fields can: self-branding. Like Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, Jenna Jameson has been more than just the talent; she has been the name that drives millions to buy products.  A great deal of Jenna Jameson's fame lies in her crossover appeal. In years past, the rap on porn was that once you did adult film work, you would never be able to go mainstream. Well, Jenna Jameson might not have deals with any Hollywood studios, but she has worked on plenty of mainstream productions. She's done voice work for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) and the animated show Family Guy. She's also appeared in major film productions like Private Parts (1997) and Analyze That (2002).  In April 2006, Jenna Jameson was the star of a video podcast ad for Adidas. And In July of that same year, Jenna Jameson became the first pornographic actress to have a wax model at Madame Tussauds (in the Las Vegas museum).  Jenna Jameson released her second book, Jenna Tales: Something Blue, in 2008.            
                Jenna Jameson was born Jenna Marie Massoli on April 9, 1974. Her father was a Las Vegas cop and her mother was a Vegas showgirl, who died of cancer when Jenna was 3. As a young girl, Jenna Jameson took ballet, developing a skill that would later come in handy at her first job. She was always attractive, and was a frequent entrant in local beauty pageants. At an early age, Jenna's sexuality started developing, and she began taking frequent peeks at her father's adult magazines.  jenna jameson at crazy horse too  Jenna Jameson got her start in adult entertainment at age 17, when she landed a job as a dancer at Las Vegas' Crazy Horse Too strip club. Although the club rejected her at first because she was still wearing braces, they relented after she removed them herself with a pair of pliers.  It was Jenna Jameson's first boyfriend, a Las Vegas tattoo artist, who introduced her to the world of porn. While one imagines that stripping couldn't have come easy to the underage Jenna (who landed her first dancing gigs with the help of a fake I.D.), within a few months she had become an expert, often pulling in as much as $2,000 a night.  jenna jameson gets hooked on drugs  Sadly, most of the time Jenna Jameson spent working in Las Vegas was a blur for her. What began as recreational drug use became a full-blown addiction, and soon Jenna was into everything from acid to speed to methamphetamine.  At 18, Jenna Jameson moved to California to reunite with her father, who helped her get clean and sober. She began taking steps toward her career and by age 20, with her father's blessing, she had appeared in men's magazines such as Hustler, Penthouse and Cheri.  jenna jameson in blue movie  Jenna Jameson began her career as an adult film star in 1993, again with her father's consent. Her first appearances were in girl-girl scenes. Her first on-screen sex scene with a woman occurred in 1994's Up and Cummers 11.  Jenna Jameson was involved in her first coed project, Cherry Pie, later that same year. By 1995, Jenna was becoming a force to be reckoned with in the porn industry. That year, she made her first big-budget film, Blue Movie, in which she played a reporter sent to uncover the realities of a porn set.  By 1996, the woman who had taken her stage name from a phone book had become a star, earning the triple crown of the porn industry: the XRCO Best New Starlet, The AVN Best New Starlet and the F.O.X.E Video Vixen. She was the first entertainer to win all three awards.  jenna jameson in private parts  In 1996, Jenna Jameson married porn star Brad Armstrong. They separated after 10 weeks. By this time, the clean and sober Jenna Jameson drew the attention of Howard Stern, who cast her in Private Parts (1997). At the premiere of the movie, Jenna Jameson met singer Marilyn Manson, whom she would later date. In 2000, she moved in with female porn star Nikki Tyler. Despite a willingness to work with females and even a few alleged lesbian relationships, Jenna Jameson has always maintained that she is heterosexual.  In 2002, five years after her mainstream debut in Private Parts, Jenna Jameson appeared on MTV in the video for Eminem's "Without Me." With the world wanting more and more of Jenna Jameson, she signed a reported six-figure book deal for her autobiography in 2004, How To Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale, as well as a tie-in television news special, Jenna Jameson's Confessions, which aired on VH1.  jenna jameson marries jay grdina  Jenna was at the top of her game in 2003, by this time both a household name and a mainstream commodity. She signed an exclusive seven-year deal with Vivid Entertainment Group (a company known for classy adult features with sexy women and story lines) to star in at least 15 films.  Seven years after separating from Brad Armstrong, Jenna finally obtained a divorce and married her boyfriend, studio owner Jay Grdina, in 2003. jenna jameson gets cancer Jenna Jameson and husband Jay Grdina decided to have children and in 2004 Jenna got pregnant. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with skin cancer just shortly after and miscarried. The stress of these two factors is what Jenna Jameson attributes to her divorce in 2006.  In the following years, Jenna Jameson was connected to stars like Dave Navarro, while 2007 saw her happily attached to ultimate fighter Tito Ortiz. jenna jameson puts out jenna tales: something blue Though there were talks of a theatrical production of her first book, which would reportedly star Scarlett Johansson, Jenna Jameson released her second book entitled Jenna Tales: Something Blue in 2008. She also had a starring role in the comedic horror flick Zombie Strippers.

World's biggest porn star tells all: bad childhood, bad  men, bad drugs  - but don't shed any tears for Jenna Jameson, says Charles Taylor
This is the part of the review where I pretend to have to tell you, the reader, who Jenna Jameson is. If we agree to dispense with that charade and admit that we both know who Jenna Jameson is (which still leaves us the out of "but I've never seen any of her movies"), then we can - tee-hee - make naughty little jokes about what must be included in a porn star's autobiography. Or we can feign a lack of interest, make knowing remarks at what crap the book must be, even look down at the poor suckers shelling out for it. We all know they're just buying it to jerk off to the pictures, right?When you get down to it, there's not much difference between those strategies of disdain and Bill O'Reilly's calling Jameson a "quasi-prostitute." They're both ways of saying that what used to be called "that type of woman" has no standing in real society. She's not a real person. And, by extension, neither are the millions of us who watch Jenna Jameson and who have made her the most successful star in the history of adult movies.As the representative face of a segment of pop culture that's both more popular than it's ever been (porn's yearly income rivals that of Hollywood and pro sports) and still unacknowledged by most of its consumers, Jenna Jameson has become an unintentional provocateur. She's managed to become a big star with only minimal appearances in the mainstream media (some hosting for the E! Channel; a recurring role on NBC's cancelled Mr Sterling series; a bit role  in Howard Stern's Private Parts and guest shots on his show). I can walk into one of the big media megastores and buy one of her movies or a 'Got Jenna?' t-shirt or a Jenna Jameson action figure. But I'm not likely to see her turning up on Letterman or Leno - and if she did, the conversation would likely be about the novelty of her being there at all.  It's doubtful that Jay or Dave would oblige her with a plug by holding up a copy of Briana Loves Jenna, the second-best-selling adult movie of all time, or her latest, The Masseuse - a remake of the 80s porn classic - or let her mention her website, Club Jenna. She towers over Times Square on a billboard. But when she appeared on the cover of New York magazine last fall, it was to illustrate a pair of hand-wringing features by David Amsden and the hapless Naomi Wolf on the alleged insidiousness of internet porn. Because of how she's become famous, Jameson has made it   harder than ever for people to maintain the hypocrisy that they recognise the names of porn stars but don't watch porn.Jenna Jameson has done more than any other performer to increase the acceptability of a part of our culture that, like it or not, isn't going away. For her, porn has not been and is not a stepping stone to 'legitimate' show biz. "The most important thing to me right now is to become the biggest star the industry has ever seen," she told Wicked Pictures founder Steve Ornstein when she asked him to put her under contract. In no part of her new autobiography, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, does she pretend that porn was a detour on a career that was meant to be spent acting or modelling or singing. Jameson is the prototype of a new sort of star, one who doesn't treat her particular brand of notoriety as notoriousness. Look at her book with that phrase - porn star right there in the title, no coyness about it.In this book, Jameson gets you rooting for her. Written with New York Times contributor Neil Strauss, the book is a captivating mess - with autobiography; celebrity dish; tips on making it in porn; transcribed conversations between Jenna, her brother and her father; pages from her teen diary, photo albums with everything from childhood snaps to skin shots to wedding pictures; comics; a '10 commandments of dating' (along with a list of the ones her husband has broken), all tossed together. A celebrity bio has to be judged on whether it's entertaining and whether, despite the ghostwriter, a real person comes through in its pages. Here, one does, and that's as much a tribute to Strauss' ability to merge with his subject as it is to the strength of Jameson's personality. How to Make Love Like a Porn Star is lively, hellaciously entertaining, sharp, feisty and touching enough to earn Jameson the right to wear that 'Heart Breaker' tattoo on her right butt cheek.Not that she ever asks for anyone's pity. Not once. The voice of this book belongs to what's usually called "a troubled kid." The difference is that in How to Make Love Like a Porn Star that voice reaches us directly and not in the way in which we usually receive such voices, as part of a sociological study or as supporting evidence in an editorial.The outline of Jenna Jameson's life so far (she's only 30) sounds like the typical run-up to a too-fast, too-soon outcome. Mother dead of cancer when she was three. Loving but devastated father ill-equipped to raise her and her older brother. A series of negligent and abusive stepmothers. A generally unsupervised upbringing, leaving her and her brother free to get into drugs and other serious mischief. Moving from town to town. Gang-raped during her family's stay in Montana, in an attack she very plausibly claims she was not meant to survive. Live-in girlfriend of a biker tattoo artist. Raped by his uncle. Work as a stripper, leading to appearances in men's magazines leading to adult movies. A growing fondness for smoking crystal meth and bad relationships. Thousands of dollars made and blown. Eventual fame in adult movies and accompanying 'tude. Unhappy first marriage to a controlling fellow porn star. Periodic lapses into drugs and booze.That Jameson is alive to tell this story would, in best E! True Hollywood Story fashion, dictates an end replete with tears, redemption and "If I knew then what I know now" contrition. In fact, there is a happy ending. Reconciliation with her father and brother. A position as CEO of her own company. A happy second marriage to porn director Justin Sterling, now her only male partner, on-screen and off. A contented domestic life in Scottsdale, Arizona. Eager anticipation of motherhood. But the strength of How to Make Love Like a Porn Star is in the way it shows that sheer, lived experience makes a hash of assumptions and ideologies.The reason Jenna Jameson has become the friendly face of porn is that she is so reassuringly familiar. She has always looked like the prettiest girl you saw hanging out at the mall (in a recent interview she talked about how excited she was that her image was appearing on a ski board, like a girl whose boyfriend has painted her name across the back of his Trans Am). Hers is an accessible, American middle-class prettiness, blond and sunny, not exotic. She doesn't possess the forbidding fashion-model beauty of a porn star like Tera Patrick (a former Ford agency model). Nor does she have the up-for-anything trashiness of the countless girls who pass through the industry.Ten years into her career, Jameson doesn't look used up or hard-bitten. Possibly that's because she limits what she does on-screen. The same avenues that made porn more available, home video and the internet, have also made it more private, able to cater to any fetish from the most benign to the most repulsive. In an industry that increasingly relies on pushing the envelope, she has always refused double penetration and gang-bangs, and has kept anal sex for her private life.Reading How to Make Love Like a Porn Star makes her seem even more familiar. Most of us have known someone, a friend or sibling or cousin, who made lousy choices and somehow come through it all OK. Often those people wind up living traditional middle-class lives - they get married, have kids, buy a home. But the route they take to get there is one that - often recklessly - shuns all the traditional middle-class safety nets of college or vocational training or settling down in one place.What could seem a better way to flout middle-class values than going into stripping or nude modelling or adult movies (even though, for some of the people who go into them, they are the quickest route to middle-class stability)? But though sex workers have often been looked down on in the name of middle-class propriety, it's interesting to think about what they share with the middle class. Back when strippers were occasional guests on daytime talk shows (instead of the staple they've become), there were always a few well-appointed middle-class women in the studio   audience who rose to chide the guest on her lack of self-respect and ask how she would ever manage to justify her job to her children. Whenever I'd hear a question like that, I always thought, fairly or not, that the person asking it must never have worked a day in her life.The assumption behind that question is that work is ennobling instead of, for most people, a drudgery they endure to feed and clothe and house themselves and their families. The now-standard glib riposte to people who call porn degrading and exploitative is that you can be degraded working at Wal-Mart or Denny's. There's an obvious problem with the analogy - people who work retail or wait on tables aren't required to fuck on camera. But the comparison isn't entirely off the mark. You can just as easily lose your self-respect doing something that society doesn't consider scandalous. And while there's a good chance that getting literally screwed will be pleasurable at least some of the time, getting figuratively screwed is never any fun.What I'm trying to get at here is the class cluelessness that has always seemed part of the knee-jerk reaction against any type of sex work. Sexism is a part of that, too, a belief that any young woman who ventures into the sex trade will wind up either a victim or a whore.Jameson doesn't settle these arguments; she complicates them. She upsets the easy assumptions of both sides in the debate about whether porn is degrading (damn straight it can be, she says) or empowering (ditto). One of the best and toughest chapters in the book is Jameson's advice to would-be porn stars. She lays out what happens to too many of the girls who arrive at the industry's regular cattle-call auditions:"In a worst-case scenario, a gonzo director will take a girl to a hotel room and have their friends shoot a cheap scene in which she is humiliated in every orifice possible. She walks home with $3,000, bowed legs, and a terrible impression of the industry. It'll be her first and last movie, and she'll regret it - to her dying day."Jameson says porn has more pitfalls "than nearly any other occupation." Drugs is one. Maintaining a boundary between your job and private life is another. The inability to recognise the distinction is shared by many who love porn and many who loathe it - in other words, they both tend to assume that porn stars are whores who will sleep with anyone.Even the girls who are lucky enough to land a contract with one of the big adult film companies like Vivid or VCA or   Wicked find their battles aren't over. A contract girl gets between $75,000 to $100,000 to appear in 10 movies a year  (at probably two to three scenes a movie). They don't own any rights to their screen work, so scenes can be reused in compilations. And because the adult industry isn't unionised and the films are so cheap to make, the stars make a  piddling slice of the overall profits. (The professional in Jameson seems ashamed by the diva behaviour she indulged in following her success, though it's tough to read her account of that time and not feel that, for the money they make off her, the producers deserved a little bitchiness in their lives.)The same is true with photo shoots, where photographers often retain the right to resell the photos for which they've paid models a basic fee. (Jameson calls the most famous adult photographer, Suze Randall, whom she insists she likes, "a shark.") To make more money, many porn stars tour strip clubs as 'featured dancers', which can present its own problems, like obnoxious fans and chiselling club owners - one told Jameson she couldn't keep the tips that patrons tossed her onstage because tips weren't in her contract. (Jameson stays mum on the growing number of adult stars who hire themselves out to escort services.) And none of this touches the difficulty of having sex in front of other people, sometimes with male co-stars too nervous to perform, which isn't exactly balm for a girl's ego. But Jameson doesn't talk about porn as if it were the white-slave trade, either. She knows how easy it is for the gullible to be taken advantage of but insists that aspiring pornettes have to learn to protect themselves. (That may be a tad easy for her to say. She's right that porn stars have to be firm about what they will not do, though the ones who refuse to perform a certain act, and who don't have her charisma or star power, may find themselves with far fewer career options.)For a long time, Jameson would lie when asked if she had been abused because she didn't want to be seen as a victim. (She also rightly finds the question insulting. When was the last time you heard it asked of a comic or an actor or a musician to explain what they do?) For her, playing the victim is offensively easy. Jameson rejects the idea of using her rapes as an explanation for her career. "Was I in this business because I was victimised or because I  wanted to succeed at something?" she asks. "I examined it from every angle I could, and every time came to the same conclusion: that it didn't make a bit of difference. It occurred too late in my development to be formative. Whether it happened to me or not, I still would have become a porn star."Jenna Jameson's story has a happy ending, but not one that moralists will be able to stomach. She got her happy ending because of porn, not in spite of it. Without it, she might still be Jenna Massoli, a Vegas biker's girlfriend content to get high on crank, perhaps still stripping at a local dive and not going anywhere. The penultimate page of How to Make Love Like a Porn Star shows a laughing, resplendent Jenna Jameson on her wedding day surrounded by her father, brother, sister-in-law and young nephew. Everyone is wearing white. Even the bride.
