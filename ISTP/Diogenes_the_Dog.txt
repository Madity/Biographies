Diogenes of Sinope was born on the south coast of the Black Sea in Sinope, Paphlygonia (now the modern day Turkish city of Sinop) most likely in the year 412 or 404 BCE and died most probably in Corinth, Greece in 323 BCE. He is most well known for his rejection of convention and eschewing the amenities and luxuries of civilized life for a life of comparable poverty, though not in favor of pathos, but rather in favor of self-sufficiency and ethical values. Diogenes was extremely outspoken and infamously humorous. His philosophy was espoused and lived rather then written; it is debated whether or not he did write any texts, if so none have survived. He is considered to be the father of Cynicism, a school of thought that would have lasting impact and influence.
His early life is scantily known. Apparently, he was the son of Hicesias who is thought to have been a banker or minter or moneychanger. It has been surmised that Diogenes of Sinope worked alongside his father in which at one point they began defacing the currency. The details of this tale arent very clear and various accounts claim various variations. Some state that it was a joint effort between the two and others claim that it was Diogenes himself. Some assert that they were exiled while others claim the Diogenes fled before prosecution. Whether or not any of the accounts are true is speculative yet discoveries in archeology and numismatics have proved that a large number of coins dating from Diogenes period were in fact defaced. Another unanswered question is as to why Diogenes and/or his father would have partaken in such an act and there are as well various hypotheses as to the reason. One suggestion is political, given the contemporary strife between Persian and Greek faction over the region. Another suggestion from the Lives of Eminent Philosophers by Diogenes Laertius posits that Diogenes of Sinope was affected by the oracle at Delphi; either he had received an urging from the oracle, but misunderstood the exact terms defacing state currency instead of political currency, or visited the oracle after having defaced the currency as though it were a pre-destined calling.
Regardless of the lack of clarity and plausibility of these varying stories and accounts, Diogenes of Sinope did relocate to Athens where his philosophical life began essentially. In Athens, the story goes that Diogenes of Sinope became a pupil or disciple of Antisthenes, a former student of Socrates. Diogenes of Laertius tells of their meeting in which Antisthenes tried to refuse him, but was worn down by Diogenes of Sinopes persistence. The exactitude of this claim is much contested given discrepancies between the dates Diogenes of Sinope seems to have been in Athens and Antisthenes death. Regardless, what is clear is that Diogenes of Sinope certainly was a student of Antisthenes thought and expanded upon his ideology far surpassing the master, perhaps to an extreme, as some would argue.
Diogenes of Sinope certainly practiced what he preached and he preached a philosophy that defied convention and rejected the artificial values he attributed to contemporary Athenian society. Thus, in line with his philosophy of practice, Diogenes of Sinope took up residence in an urn-like tub in the Metroön, like an over-sized mouse. The small rodent actually was his inspiration, as he claimed it was the mouse that could teach one about adaptability.
The man, a Socrates gone mad as Plato referred to him, was very outspoken in both his presentiments and his criticismsthe two being in concert. He infamously critiqued Platos definition of man as an animal, biped and featherless by appearing in the philosophers academy with a plucked fowl exclaiming to have found human being. The incident apparently caused Plato to add to his definition, having broad nails. In jest and in earnest, Diogenes of Sinope was in search of humans or rather in search of humanity, wandering the streets in broad day light with a lanternI am looking for a man.
His espousals were born out of acts of logic and reason, and not simply as the more often perceived defiance, as in his eating in the marketplace of Athens. In the Athens of his day, it was contrary to eat in the marketplace yet it was the most logical place for Diogenes of Sinope to eat, as that is where he found himself most hungry. He was known to have repeatedly professed, according to Diogenes of Laertius, for the conduct of life we need right reason or halter. Diogenes of Sinope considered a life led without reason akin to leading a life like a kept animal, needing to be lead with a leash (or halter). For him, reason was considered to be ones best companion, so-to-speak. Reason and logic should be ones guiding principle having the capability to provide one with the optimal manner in which to live ones life. Thus, Diogenes of Sinope was not against higher learning or the pursuit of knowledge, but rather against the pretensions of such and in favor of the nature of such, which to him was simply rational understanding.
Yet, it is not so simple as the mad Socratescould barely find a natural human being or a man in accordance with nature. For Diogenes of Sinope, to be in harmony with nature is to be rational hence the nature of being human is to act in reason. Most men do not fit this description and are instead caught up in convention and pretense, self-deception and vanity. Morality is not to be found, but rather inferred in the simplicity of nature, such simplicity now complicated by humans, as he is credited with exclaiming, humans have complicated every simple gift of the gods.
Furthermore, his understanding of nature and reason applied to everything such that all elements are contained in all things and pervade everything: since not only is meat a constituent of bread, but bread of vegetables; and all other bodies also, by means of certain invisible passages and particles, find their way in and unite with all substances in the form of vapor (Diogenes of Laertius). This clever, and albeit reasonable argument very much worked in his favor as in the case for stealing, food or what have you.
For Diogenes of Sinope, self-sufficiency was of utmost importance and went hand in hand with his notion of a rational being in reason that is symbiotic with nature. And thus such a life is outside the bounds of convention and societal rules and regulations. The civilized world is a constructed apparatus that is artificialgetting back to nature, being guided by nature qua reason, is the way through life. He contrariness to the development of the polis and the exhortation of what he considered abstract philosophy and his focus on the self-sufficiency of reason led him to become known as the father of Cynicism.
The word, Cynicism, comes from the Greek work kynikos, which means dog-like, stemming from kyôn, meaning dog. There are various accounts as to how the name came to be used in association with Diogenes of Sinope; some say it developed from his own accounts of a dogs life being true and present in the moment without artifice. Others say it developed earlier from the name of the school, Cynosarges, where Antisthenes taught, which translates to the place of the white dog. Further accounts develop the relation more conceptually from particular traits of a dogs life: that of indifference, shamelessness, guardian, and intuitively discriminating. Regardless of the particular relation or relations, the association fixed and became, essentially, a proper name in philosophy. As well, in most portrayals of Diogenes of Sinope, he is rendered disheveled, carrying a lantern and most often with a dog at his side.
As in Corinth, where Diogenes of Sinope died, a statue stands portraying the mad Socrates with his lantern and a dog by his side. Diogenes of Sinope ended up in Corinth due to having been captured by pirates, as the story goes. Supposedly, he was on a trip to Aegina, captured by pirates and then sold as a slave in Crete to a man from Corinth, Xeniades. The accounts recall that Diogenes of Sinope claimed no other expertise, skill or trade than the ability to govern men, and thus became tutor to the Corinthians two sons and lived the rest of his life in Corinth. It is said that he remained as outspoken as he had become known for in Athens and continued to live in public and practice his philosophy. One of the most told stories from his time in Corinth is his infamous encounter with Alexander the Great, in which Diogenes of Sinope criticized the emperor causing him to become one of Diogenes of Sinopes greatest fans, apparently stating that if he were not Alexander the Great then he would be Diogenes of Sinope.
Diogenes of Sinope certainly developed a reputation through his philosophy of practice. Having claimed to be a cosmopolitan, a citizen of the world, he was radical and avant-garde in his thinking and way of life, which inspired a great following. Crates embraced his philosophy of cynicism and developed and preached it accordingly. His pupil, Zeno of Citium, carried on the tradition of cynicism which soon developed into the well known and tread school of thought called Stoicism. It could be contested that perhaps this feature of development and domestication Diogenes of Sinope would have detested; either way, his influence certainly cannot be contested.

=======================================================
Diogenes of Sinope (/daɪˈɒdʒəˌniz/; Greek: Διογένης ὁ Σινωπεύς, Diogenēs ho Sinōpeus) was a Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Cynic philosophy. Also known as Diogenes the Cynic (Ancient Greek: Διογένης ὁ Κυνικός, Diogenēs ho Kunikos), he was born in Sinope (modern-day Sinop, Turkey), an Ionian colony on the Black Sea,[1] in 412 or 404 BCE and died at Corinth in 323 BCE.[2]
Diogenes of Sinope was a controversial figure. His father minted coins for a living, and when Diogenes took to debasement of currency, he was banished from Sinope.[1] After being exiled, he moved to Athens to debunk cultural conventions. Diogenes modelled himself on the example of Heracles. He believed that virtue was better revealed in action than in theory. He used his simple lifestyle and behaviour to criticise the social values and institutions of what he saw as a corrupt society. He declared himself a cosmopolitan. There are many tales about him dogging Antisthenes' footsteps and becoming his "faithful hound".[3] Diogenes made a virtue of poverty. He begged for a living and slept in a large ceramic jar[4] in the marketplace. He became notorious for his philosophical stunts such as carrying a lamp in the daytime, claiming to be looking for an honest man. He embarrassed Plato, disputed his interpretation of Socrates and sabotaged his lectures. Diogenes was also responsible for publicly mocking Alexander the Great.
After being captured by pirates and sold into slavery, Diogenes eventually settled in Corinth. There he passed his philosophy of Cynicism to Crates, who taught it to Zeno of Citium, who fashioned it into the school of Stoicism, one of the most enduring schools of Greek philosophy. None of Diogenes' many writings has survived, but details of his life come in the form of anecdotes (chreia), especially from Diogenes Laërtius, in his book Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. All we have is a number of anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources.[5]
Diogenes was born in the Greek colony of Sinope on the south coast of the Black Sea, in either 412 BC or 404 BCE.[2] Nothing is known about his early life except that his father Hicesias was a banker.[6] It seems likely that Diogenes was also enrolled into the banking business aiding his father. At some point (the exact date is unknown), Hicesias and Diogenes became embroiled in a scandal involving the adulteration or debasement of the currency,[7] and Diogenes got exiled from the city,lost his citizenship,and all his material possessions.[8][9] This aspect of the story seems to be corroborated by archaeology: large numbers of defaced coins (smashed with a large chisel stamp) have been discovered at Sinope dating from the middle of the 4th century BCE, and other coins of the time bear the name of Hicesias as the official who minted them.[10] During this time there was a lot of counterfeit money circulating in Sinope.[8] The coins were deliberately defaced in order to render then worthless as legal tender.;[8] Sinope was being disputed between pro-Persian and pro-Greek factions in the 4th century, and there may have been political rather than financial motives behind the act.
According to one story,[9] Diogenes went to the Oracle at Delphi to ask for its advice and was told that he should "deface the currency". Following the debacle in Sinope, Diogenes decided that the oracle meant that he should deface the political currency rather than actual coins. He traveled to Athens and made it his life's goal to challenge established customs and values. He argued that instead of being troubled about the true nature of evil, people merely rely on customary interpretations. This distinction between nature ("physis") and custom ("nomos") is a favorite theme of ancient Greek philosophy, and one that Plato takes up in The Republic, in the legend of the Ring of Gyges.[11]
Diogenes arrived in Athens with a slave named Manes who abandoned him shortly thereafter. With characteristic humour, Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying, "If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes?"[12] Diogenes would mock such a relation of extreme dependency. He found the figure of a master who could do nothing for himself contemptibly helpless. He was attracted by the ascetic teaching of Antisthenes, a student of Socrates. When Diogenes asked Antisthenes to mentor him, Antisthenes ignored him and reportedly "eventually beat him off with his staff".[1] Diogenes responds, "Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from you, so long as I think you've something to say."[1] Diogenes became Antisthenes' pupil, despite the brutality with which he was initially received.[13] Whether the two ever really met is still uncertain,[14][15][16] but he surpassed his master in both reputation and the austerity of his life. He considered his avoidance of earthly pleasures a contrast to and commentary on contemporary Athenian behaviors. This attitude was grounded in a disdain for what he regarded as the folly, pretense, vanity, self-deception, and artificiality of human conduct.
The stories told of Diogenes illustrate the logical consistency of his character. He inured himself to the weather by living in a clay wine jar[4][17] belonging to the temple of Cybele.[18] He destroyed the single wooden bowl he possessed on seeing a peasant boy drink from the hollow of his hands. He then exclaimed," Fool that I am, to have been carrying superfluous baggage all this time!"[19][20] It was contrary to Athenian customs to eat within the marketplace, and still he would eat, for, as he explained when rebuked, it was during the time he was in the marketplace that he felt hungry. He used to stroll about in full daylight with a lamp; when asked what he was doing, he would answer, "I am just looking for an honest man."[21] Diogenes looked for a human being but reputedly found nothing but rascals and scoundrels.[22]
When Plato gave Socrates' definition of man as "featherless bipeds" and was much praised for the definition, Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, saying, "Behold! I've brought you a man." After this incident, "with broad flat nails" was added to Plato's definition.[23]
According to a story which seems to have originated with Menippus of Gadara,[24] Diogenes was captured by pirates while on voyage to Aegina and sold as a slave in Crete to a Corinthian named Xeniades. Being asked his trade, he replied that he knew no trade but that of governing men, and that he wished to be sold to a man who needed a master. In fact, this was a pun. In ancient Greek this would sound both as "Governing men" and "Teaching values to people".[25] Xeniades liked his spirit and hired Diogenes to tutor his children. As tutor to Xeniades' two sons,[26] it is said that he lived in Corinth for the rest of his life, which he devoted to preaching the doctrines of virtuous self-control. There are many stories about what actually happened to him after his time with Xeniades' two sons. There are stories stating he was set free after he became "a cherished member of the household", while one says he was set free almost immediately, and still another states that "he grew old and died at Xeniades' house in Corinth."[27] He is even said to have lectured to large audiences at the Isthmian Games.[28]
Although most of the stories about him living in a jar[4] are located in Athens, there are some accounts of him living in a jar near the Craneum gymnasium in Corinth:
A report that Philip II of Macedon was marching on the town had thrown all Corinth into a bustle; one was furbishing his arms, another wheeling stones, a third patching the wall, a fourth strengthening a battlement, every one making himself useful somehow or other. Diogenes having nothing to do – of course no one thought of giving him a job – was moved by the sight to gather up his philosopher's cloak and begin rolling his tub energetically up and down the Craneum; an acquaintance asked for, and got, the explanation: "I do not want to be thought the only idler in such a busy multitude; I am rolling my tub to be like the rest."[29]
It was in Corinth that a meeting between Alexander the Great and Diogenes is supposed to have taken place.[30] The accounts of Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius recount that they exchanged only a few words: while Diogenes was relaxing in the sunlight in the morning, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, "Yes, stand out of my sunlight". Alexander then declared, "If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes", to which Diogenes replied, "If I were not Diogenes, I should also wish to be Diogenes."[31] In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, "I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave."[32]
There are conflicting accounts of Diogenes' death. He is alleged variously to have held his breath; to have become ill from eating raw octopus;[33] or to have suffered an infected dog bite.[34] When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, "Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!" When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied "If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?"[35] At the end, Diogenes made fun of people's excessive concern with the "proper" treatment of the dead. The Corinthians erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of Parian marble.[36]
Along with Antisthenes and Crates of Thebes, Diogenes is considered one of the founders of Cynicism. The ideas of Diogenes, like those of most other Cynics, must be arrived at indirectly. No writings of Diogenes survived even though he is reported to have authored over ten books, a volume of letters and seven tragedies.[37] Cynic ideas are inseparable from Cynic practice; therefore what we know about Diogenes is contained in anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources.
Diogenes maintained that all the artificial growths of society were incompatible with happiness and that morality implies a return to the simplicity of nature. So great was his austerity and simplicity that the Stoics would later claim him to be a wise man or "sophos". In his words, "Humans have complicated every simple gift of the gods."[38] Although Socrates had previously identified himself as belonging to the world, rather than a city,[39] Diogenes is credited with the first known use of the word "cosmopolitan". When he was asked where he came from, he replied, "I am a citizen of the world (cosmopolites)".[40] This was a radical claim in a world where a man's identity was intimately tied to his citizenship in a particular city state. An exile and an outcast, a man with no social identity, Diogenes made a mark on his contemporaries.
Diogenes had nothing but disdain for Plato and his abstract philosophy.[41] Diogenes viewed Antisthenes as the true heir to Socrates, and shared his love of virtue and indifference to wealth,[42] together with a disdain for general opinion.[43] Diogenes shared Socrates' belief that he could function as doctor to men's souls and improve them morally, while at the same time holding contempt for their obtuseness. Plato once described Diogenes as "a Socrates gone mad."[44]
Diogenes taught by living example. He tried to demonstrate that wisdom and happiness belong to the man who is independent of society and that civilization is regressive. He scorned not only family and political social organization, but also property rights and reputation. He even rejected normal ideas about human decency. Diogenes is said to have eaten in the marketplace,[45] urinated on some people who insulted him,[46] defecated in the theatre,[47] masturbated in public. When asked about his eating in public he said, "If taking breakfast is nothing out of place, then it is nothing out of place in the marketplace. But taking breakfast is nothing out of place, therefore it is nothing out of place to take breakfast in the marketplace." [48] In the indecent of him masturbating in public he would say, "It were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly"[49][50]
From Life of Diogenes: "Someone took him [Diogenes] into a magnificent house and warned him not to spit, whereupon, having cleared his throat, he spat into the man's face, being unable, he said, to find a meaner receptacle."
Many anecdotes of Diogenes refer to his dog-like behavior, and his praise of a dog's virtues. It is not known whether Diogenes was insulted with the epithet "doggish" and made a virtue of it, or whether he first took up the dog theme himself.When asked why he was called dog he replied,"I fawn on those who give me anything,I yelp at those who refuse, and I set my teeth in rascals."[17] Diogenes believed human beings live artificially and hypocritically and would do well to study the dog. Besides performing natural body functions in public with ease, a dog will eat anything, and make no fuss about where to sleep. Dogs live in the present without anxiety, and have no use for the pretensions of abstract philosophy. In addition to these virtues, dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe.[51] Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Diogenes stated that "other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them."[52]
The term "Cynic" itself derives from the Greek word κυνικός, kynikos, "dog-like" and that from κύων, kyôn, "dog" (genitive: kynos).[53] One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called dogs was because Antisthenes taught in the Cynosarges gymnasium at Athens.[54] The word Cynosarges means the place of the white dog. Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage, as a later commentator explained:
There are four reasons why the Cynics are so named. First because of the indifference of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second reason is that the dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.[55]
As noted (see Death), Diogenes' association with dogs was memorialized by the Corinthians, who erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of Parian marble.[36]
Diogenes is discussed in a 1983 book by German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk (English language publication in 1987). In his Critique of Cynical Reason, Diogenes is used as an example of Sloterdijk's idea of the "kynical" — in which personal degradation is used for purposes of community comment or censure. Calling the practice of this tactic "kynismos", Sloterdijk explains that the kynical actor actually embodies the message he is trying to convey. The goal here is typically a false regression that mocks authority — especially authority that the kynical actor considers corrupt, suspect or unworthy.
There is another discussion of Diogenes and the Cynics in Michel Foucault's book Fearless Speech. Here Foucault discusses Diogenes' antics in relation to the speaking of truth (parrhesia) in the ancient world. Foucault expands this reading in his last course at the Collège de France, The Courage of Truth. In this course Foucault tries to establish an alternative conception of militancy and revolution through a reading of Diogenes and Cynicism.[56]
Diogenes' name has been applied to a behavioural disorder characterised by involuntary self-neglect and hoarding.[57] The disorder afflicts the elderly and has no relation to Diogenes' deliberate rejection of material comfort.[58]
Both in ancient and in modern times, Diogenes' personality has appealed strongly to sculptors and to painters. Ancient busts exist in the museums of the Vatican, the Louvre, and the Capitol. The interview between Diogenes and Alexander is represented in an ancient marble bas-relief found in the Villa Albani.
Among artists who have painted the famous encounter of Diogenes with Alexander, there are works by de Crayer, de Vos, Assereto, Langetti, Sevin, Sebastiano Ricci, Gandolfi, Johann Christian Thomas Wink (de), Abildgaard, Monsiau, Martin, and Daumier. The famous story of Diogenes searching for an "honest man" has been depicted by Jordaens, van Everdingen, van der Werff, Pannini, and Corinth. Others who have painted him with his famous lantern include de Ribera, Castiglione, Petrini, Gérôme, Bastien-Lepage, and Waterhouse. The scene in which Diogenes discards his cup has been painted by Poussin, Rosa, and Martin; and the story of Diogenes begging from a statue has been depicted by Restout. In Raphael's fresco The School of Athens, a lone reclining figure in the foreground represents Diogenes.[59]
Diogenes is referred to in Anton Chekhov's story "Ward No. 6"; William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell; François Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel; Goethe's poem Genialisch Treiben; as well as in the first sentence of Søren Kierkegaard's novelistic treatise Repetition. The story of Diogenes and the lamp is referenced by the character Foma Fomitch in Fyodor Dostoevsky's "The Friend of the Family" as well as "The Idiot". In Cervantes' short story "The Man of Glass" ("El licenciado Vidriera"), part of the Novelas Ejemplares collection, the (anti-)hero unaccountably begins to channel Diogenes in a string of tart chreiai once he becomes convinced that he is made of glass. Diogenes gives his own life and opinions in Christoph Martin Wieland's novel Socrates Mainomenos (1770; English translation Socrates Out of His Senses, 1771). Diogenes is the primary model for the philosopher Didactylos in Terry Pratchett's Small Gods. He is mimicked by a beggar-spy in Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Scion and paid tribute to with a costume in a party by the main character in its sequel, Kushiel's Justice. The character Lucy Snowe in Charlotte Brontë's novel Villette is given the nickname Diogenes. Diogenes also features in Part Four of Elizabeth Smart's By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept. He is a figure in Seamus Heaney's The Haw Lantern. In Christopher Moore's Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal, one of Jesus' apostles is a devotee of Diogenes, complete with his own pack of dogs which he refers to as his own disciples. His story opens the first chapter of Dolly Freed's 1978 book Possum Living.[60] The dog that Paul Dombey befriends in Charles Dickens' Dombey and Son is called Diogenes. Alexander's meeting with Diogenes is portrayed in Valerio Manfredi's (Alexander Trilogy) "The Ends of the Earth".[61]
The many allusions to dogs in Shakespeare's Timon of Athens are references to the school of Cynicism that could be interpreted as suggesting a parallel between the misanthropic hermit, Timon, and Diogenes; but Shakespeare would have had access to Michel de Montaigne's essay, "Of Democritus and Heraclitus", which emphasised their differences: Timon actively wishes men ill and shuns them as dangerous, whereas Diogenes esteems them so little that contact with them could not disturb him[62] "Timonism" is in fact often contrasted with "Cynicism": "Cynics saw what people could be and were angered by what they had become; Timonists felt humans were hopelessly stupid & uncaring by nature and so saw no hope for change."[63]
The philosopher's name was adopted by the fictional Diogenes Club, an organization that Sherlock Holmes' brother Mycroft Holmes belongs to in the story "The Greek Interpreter" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is called such as its members are educated, yet untalkative and have a dislike of socialising, much like the philosopher himself. The group is the focus of a number of Holmes pastiches by Kim Newman. In the Rodgers and Hart musical The Boys From Syracuse (1938), the song Oh Diogenes!—which extols the philosopher's virtues—contains the lyrics "there was an old zany/ who lived in a tub;/ he had so many flea-bites / he didn't know where to rub."
Diogenes was a character in the play and later movie A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Buster Keaton played the part in the movie while terminally ill.[64]
In the 2012 series of Horrible Histories, Diogenes was depicted by Laurence Rickard in a song alongside Socrates (Ben Willbond), Plato (Jim Howick) and Aristotle (Mathew Baynton). The song was a parody of the theme from The Monkees, entitled "The Thinkers".

=======================================================
The most illustrious of the Cynic philosophers, Diogenes of Sinope serves as the template for the Cynic sage in antiquity. An alleged student of Antisthenes, Diogenes maintains his teacher’s asceticism and emphasis on ethics, but brings to these philosophical positions a dynamism and sense of humor unrivaled in the history of philosophy. Though originally from Sinope, the majority of the stories comprising his philosophical biography occur in Athens, and some of the most celebrated of these place Alexander the Great or Plato as his foil.It is disputed whether Diogenes left anything in writing. If he did, the texts he composed have since been lost. In Cynicism, living and writing are two components of ethical practice, but Diogenes is much like Socrates and even Plato in his sentiments regarding the superiority of direct verbal interaction over the written account. Diogenes scolds Hegesias after he asks to be lent one of Diogenes’ writing tablets: “You are a simpleton, Hegesias; you do not choose painted figs, but real ones; and yet you pass over the true training and would apply yourself to written rules” (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 48). In reconstructing Diogenes’ ethical model, then, the life he lived is as much his philosophical work as any texts he may have composed.
The exceptional nature of Diogenes’ life generates some difficulty for determining the exact events that comprise it. He was a citizen of Sinope who either fled or was exiled because of a problem involving the defacing of currency. Thanks to numismatic evidence, the adulteration of Sinopean coinage is one event about which there is certainty. The details of the defacing, though, are murkier: “Diocles relates that [Diogenes] went into exile because his father was entrusted with the money of the state and adulterated the coinage. But Eubulides in his book on Diogenes says that Diogenes himself did this and was forced to leave home along with his father” (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 20). Whether it was Diogenes or his father who defaced the currency, and for whatever reasons they may have done so, the act lead to Diogenes’ relocation to Athens.
Diogenes’ biography becomes, historically, only sketchier. For example, one story claims that Diogenes was urged by the oracle at Delphi to adulterate the political currency, but misunderstood and defaced the state currency (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 20). A second version tells of Diogenes traveling to Delphi and receiving this same oracle after he had already altered the currency, turning his crime into a calling. It is, finally, questionable whether Diogenes ever consulted the oracle at all; the Delphic advice is curiously close to Socrates’ own injunction, and the interweaving of life and legend in Diogenes’ case is just as substantial.
Once in Athens, Diogenes famously took a tub, or a pithos, for an abode. In Lives of Eminent Philosophers, it is reported that Diogenes “had written to some one to try and procure a cottage for him. When this man was a long time about it, he took for his abode the tub in the Metroön, as he himself explains in his letters” (Diogenes Laertius, Book 6, Chapter 23). Apparently Diogenes discovered that he had no need for conventional shelter or any other “dainties” from having watched a mouse. The lesson the mouse teaches is that he is capable of adapting himself to any circumstance. This adaptability is the origin of Diogenes’ legendary askēsis, or training.
Diogenes Laertius reports that Diogenes of Sinope “fell in” with Antisthenes who, though not in the habit of taking students, was worn out by Diogenes’ persistence (Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 22). Although this account has been met with suspicion, especially given the likely dates of Diogenes’ arrival in Athens and Antisthenes’ death, it supports the perception that the foundation of Diogenes’ philosophical practice rests with Antisthenes.
Another important, though possibly invented, episode in Diogenes’ life centers around his enslavement in Corinth after having been captured by pirates. When asked what he could do, he replied “Govern men,” which is precisely what he did once bought by Xeniades. He was placed in charge of Xeniades’ sons, who learned to follow his ascetic example. One story tells of Diogenes’ release after having become a cherished member of the household, another claims Xeniades freed him immediately, and yet another maintains that he grew old and died at Xeniades’ house in Corinth. Whichever version may be true (and, of course, they all could be false), the purpose is the same: Diogenes the slave is freer than his master, who he rightly convinces to submit to his obedience.
Though most accounts agree that he lived to be quite old— some suggesting he lived until ninety— the tales of Diogenes’ death are no less multiple than those of his life. The possible cause of death includes a voluntary demise by holding his breath, an illness brought on by eating raw octopus, or death by dog bite. Given the embellished feel of each of these reports, it is more likely that he died of old age.
When Plato is asked what sort of man Diogenes is, he responds, “A Socrates gone mad” (Diogenes Laertius, Book 6, Chapter 54). Plato’s label is representative, for Diogenes’ adaptation of Socratic philosophy has frequently been regarded as one of degradation. Certain scholars have understood Diogenes as an extreme version of Socratic wisdom, offering a fascinating, if crude, moment in the history of ancient thought, but which ought not to be confused with the serious business of philosophy. This reading is influenced by the mixture of shamelessness and askēsis which riddle Diogenes’ biography. This understanding, though, overlooks the centrality of reason in Diogenes’ practice.
Diogenes’ sense of shamelessness is best seen in the context of Cynicism in general. Specifically, though, it stems from a repositioning of convention below nature and reason. One guiding principle is that if an act is not shameful in private, that same act is not made shameful by being performed in public. For example, it was contrary to Athenian convention to eat in the marketplace, and yet there he would eat for, as he explained when reproached, it was in the marketplace that he felt hungry. The most scandalous of these sorts of activities involves his indecent behavior in the marketplace, to which he responded “he wished it were as easy to relieve hunger by rubbing an empty stomach” (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 46).
He is labeled mad for acting against convention, but Diogenes points out that it is the conventions which lack reason: “Most people, he would say, are so nearly mad that a finger makes all the difference. For if you go along with your middle finger stretched out, some one will think you mad, but, if it’s the little finger, he will not think so” (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 35). In these philosophical fragments, reason clearly has a role to play. There is a report that Diogenes “would continually say that for the conduct of life we need right reason or a halter” (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 24). For Diogenes, each individual should either allow reason to guide her conduct, or, like an animal, she will need to be lead by a leash; reason guides one away from mistakes and toward the best way in which to live life. Diogenes, then, does not despise knowledge as such, but despises pretensions to knowledge that serve no purpose.
He is especially scornful of sophisms. He disproves an argument that a person has horns by touching his forehead, and in a similar manner, counters the claim that there is no such thing as motion by walking around. He elsewhere disputes Platonic definitions and from this comes one of his more memorable actions: “Plato had defined the human being as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, ‘Here is Plato’s human being.’ In consequence of which there was added to the definition, ‘having broad nails’” (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 40). Diogenes is a harsh critic of Plato, regularly disparaging Plato’s metaphysical pursuits and thereby signaling a clear break from primarily theoretical ethics.
Diogenes’ talent for undercutting social and religious conventions and subverting political power can tempt readers into viewing his position as merely negative. This would, however, be a mistake. Diogenes is clearly contentious, but he is so for the sake of promoting reason and virtue. In the end, for a human to be in accord with nature is to be rational, for it is in the nature of a human being to act in accord with reason. Diogenes has trouble finding such humans, and expresses his sentiments regarding his difficulty theatrically. Diogenes is reported to have “lit a lamp in broad daylight and said, as he went about, ‘I am searching for a human being’” (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 41).
For the Cynics, life in accord with reason is lived in accord with nature, and therefore life in accord with reason is greater than the bounds of convention and the polis. Furthermore, the Cynics claim that such a life is the life worth living. As a homeless and penniless exile, Diogenes experienced the greatest misfortunes of which the tragedians write, and yet he insisted that he lived the good life: “He claimed that to fortune he could oppose courage, to convention nature, to passion reason” (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book 6, Chapter 38).

=======================================================
Diogenes was one of the ancient Greek philosophers famous for his distinct attitude. To know more about him, read his brief biography in the lines below.
Diogenes was a commendable Greek philosopher and one of the founders of the Cynic philosophy from Sinope. He is also remembered as "Diogenes of Sinope" or simply Diogenes. He was the only person to be the pupil of Antisthenes. Being an alleged student of Antisthenes, he maintained his teacher's asceticism and emphasis on ethics but carried out these philosophical positions with dynamism and sense of humor unique in the history of philosophy. He was among the very few men to openly mock "Alexander the Great" and live. At one time, he cleverly ashamed Plato and looked upon Antisthenes as the true beneficiary of Socrates. Diogenes illustrated his philosophy of Cynicism to Crates who taught it to Zeno of Citium who further forwarded it into the school of Stoicism which was amongst the most enduring Greek philosophy schools. All his life, he was surrounded by controversies. 
Diogenes was thrown out of his native place for damaging the currency. He then moved to Athens and struggled for livelihood. However, despite being poor and not well-off, Diogenes was much talked about, thanks to his proactive behavior and philosophical stunts. He was usually involved in an argument with Plato. After being hooked by the pirates and sold into slavery, he, by the course of time, settled in Corinth. Diogenes was also a loyal admirer of Hercules. The entire life of Diogenes was an adamant campaign to debunk social values and institutions of what he examined as a society full of corruption. The belief of Diogenes was that the virtue was excellently exposed in action than in theory. All his writings were destroyed by time, but the details of his life is taken from the forms of anecdotes, specifically from Diogenes Laërtius's book "Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers."
Diogenes was born on 412 BC in the Greek colony of Sinope on the south coast of the Black Sea. There is no information on his early life except that his father’s name was Hicesias who was a banker by profession. It appears that Diogenes was also engaged into the banking business helping his father. At one time, Diogenes and his father got involved in a scandal of adulteration or defacement of the currency inviting trouble for themselves. As a result, Diogenes was thrown out from the city. This aspect of the story is certified by the archaeological evidence as several defaced coins destroyed by a big chisel stamp were found at Sinope dated the middle of the 4th century BC, and other coins of the same time period bearing the name of Hicesias as the official who created them. The reason for this act is still not clear, although Sinope had been the witness of clashes between pro-Persian and pro-Greek factions in the 4th century, and there may be some political motives behind the same. Another story regarding this act suggests that Diogenes went to the Oracle at Delphi to take its advice, and was asked that he should “deface the currency”, and Diogenes realized that the oracle meant that he should deface the political currency rather than the actual coins. He, then, journeyed to Athens making his goal for a life to challenge the already present customs and values.
After coming to Athens, Diogenes motive became to metaphorically destroy the “coinage” of custom. Destroying the established customs and values became the main motive of his life. Instead of being worried about the real nature of evil, people simply depended on customary interpretations. This distinction between nature and custom remained a most liked theme of Greek philosophers in ancient times. Diogenes is said to have moved to Athens with a slave called ‘Manes’, who eventually left him. With an in-built characteristic humor, Diogenes abolished his misfortune by saying “If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes?” Diogenes continued making joke of such immense dependency relations. He was charmed by the ascetic teachings of Antisthenes who was a pupil of Socrates. Also, in spite of the cruelty he experienced initially, Diogenes became the student of Antisthenes. The fact that the two ever actually met is unclear, but he instantly surpassed Antisthenes in terms of reputation as well as in life’s austerity. He believed his escape of earthly delights a contrast to and explanation on contemporary Athenian behaviors. This attitude was laid in a great abhor for what he saw as the folly, pretense, vanity, self-deception, and artificiality of much human conduct.
According to stories recited, there lies a glimpse of the logical regularity of his character. He adapted himself to the vicissitudes of weather by residing in a tub owned by the temple of Cybele. He broke down his only wooden bowl after looking at a peasant boy drinking from the hollow of his hands. It was also opposite to the believes of the Athenian customs to eat in the marketplace; however, still Diogenes would eat explaining when criticized that he felt hungry when he was in the marketplace. Another strange act that Diogenes indulged in was wandering in broad daylight carrying a lamp. When asked what he was doing, he used to answer, “I am just looking for an honest man”. He generally searched for a human being, but always ended up finding nothing but rascals and scoundrels. When Plato suggested the Socrates' definition of man as “featherless bipeds”, and received great praise for the same, Diogenes pulled a chicken and brought it into the Academy of Plato and said “Behold! I've brought you a man”. After this act of Diogenes, the definition was revised and “with broad flat nails” was added to the definition.  
Believing a story which seems to be originated with Menippus of Gadara, once Diogenes was on a voyage to Aegina and was grabbed by pirates. He was then sold for slavery to a Corinthian named “Xeniades” in Crete. When he was asked about his trade, Diogenes answered that he knew nothing about trade but that of governing men and also that he desired to be sold to a man who required a master. Thereafter, Diogenes resided in Corinth as a tutor of Xeniades' two sons for the rest of his life. He completely dedicated his life to preaching the doctrines of virtuous self-control. Also, some suggest that he even lectured a large number of people at the Isthmian Games.  
In the Corinth itself, Diogenes met Alexander the Great. The accounts of Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius depict that the two exchanged only a few words. One morning, Diogenes was resting in the sunlight when he was stimulated after meeting the popular philosopher, Alexander. When asked if he wanted any favor, Diogenes replied “Yes, stand out of my sunlight”. Alexander then announced, “If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes”. Also in another story, Alexander saw Diogenes looking at a pile of human bones with extreme concentration. Diogenes explained that “I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave”.
Diogenes died in 323 BC. There are a large number of accounts suggesting the death of Diogenes. He is said to variously hold his breathe or to have became sick after eating a raw octopus or having been bitten by an infected dog. When Diogenes was questioned how he desired to be buried, he directed to be dumped outside the city wall so that wild animals could enjoy feast on his body. When asked that if he minded the same, he replied “Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!” To this, the people were surprised and asked him that how could he use the stick when he lacked the awareness, he replied, “If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?” Later, Diogenes made fun of people's excessive concern with the “proper” treatment of the dead. The Corinthians erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog made of Parian marble.

which could be brought to perfection without practice, and that that alone was able to overcome every
obstacle; that, therefore, as we ought to repudiate all useless toils, and to apply ourselves to useful
labours and to live happily, we are only unhappy in consequence of most exceeding folly. For the very

The Greek philosopher Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412-c. 323 B.C.) was a Cynic -- that is, a practitioner of the philosophy of Cynicism. Diogenes is said to have been homeless, to have begged or stolen what he needed to survive, and to have preferred to live without any luxuries.
One of the many anecdotes about Diogenes the Cynic is that when the philosopher was rude to Alexander the Great, Alexander responded by saying that if he weren't Alexander, he would want to be Diogenes. Diogenes and Alexander the Great are said to have died on the same day. Diogenes is depicted in art carrying a lantern with which he is said to have vainly hunted by daylight for an honest man. Diogenes is also said to have worked minting coins with his father until he was 60, but was then exiled for debasing the coinage.
Diogenes was called Kynos -- Greek for dog -- for his lifestyle and contrariness. It was from this word for dog that we get the word Cynic.
"At a feast certain people kept throwing all the bones to him as they would have done to a dog. Thereupon he played a dog's trick and drenched them."
~ Life of Diogenes [of Sinope] Diogenes Laertes, Lives of Eminent Philosophers Book VI, Chapter 2. Trans. R.D. Hicks (1925)
Diogenes was a student of the philosopher Antisthenes, himself a student of Socrates. Principles of their Cynic philosophy (Cynicism) were:

Diogenes was chief among the school known as the cynics, though possibly not representative of it [Diogenes "carried the principles of the sect to an extreme of asceticism." (OED.)]. It was said of Diogenes that throughout his life he "searched with a lantern in the daylight for an honest man."  And though Diogenes apparently did not find an honest man, he had, in the process, "exposed the vanity and selfishness of man." (Chambers.)
The sect, known as the cynics, was founded by Antisthenes (444-370 BC), a pupil of Socrates; it was "marked by an ostentatious contempt for ease, wealth, and the enjoyments of life."  Diogenes was a pupil of Antisthenes. Diogenes, on coming to Athens from his native lands, Sinope, came as "a rake and spendthrift."  After following under the spell of Antisthenes, Diogenes "became at once an austere ascetic, his clothing of the coarsest, his food the plainest, and his bed the bare ground.  At length he found himself a permanent residence in a tub."
(The meaning of cynicism today is to be found in the OED.  "A person disposed to rail or find fault; now usually: One who shows a disposition to disbelieve in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions, and is wont to express this by sneers and sarcasms; a sneering fault-finder."  The image of a cynic that has come to us is that of a dog.)
An interesting story is the one where the young Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) met Diogenes, then a very old man.  The powerful young conqueror, being solicitous of the old philosopher, asked what, if anything he could do for him.  Diogenes replied, "Stand out of my sunshine."  Alexander was impress with this response, and on taking his leave, commented to one of his friends: "If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes."
