          Ellen Philpotts-Page was born on February 21, 1987, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Page wanted to start acting at an early age and attended the Neptune Theater School. She began her career at the age of 10 on the award-winning television series Pit Pony (1999), for which she received a Gemini nomination and a Young Artist Awards nomination. Later, Page appeared in Marion Bridge (2002), which won the award for Best Canadian First Feature at the Toronto International Film Festival. She won a Gemini Award for her role of Lilith in the first season of ReGenesis (2004), a one-hour drama for TMN/Movie Central, and for the cable feature, Mrs. Ashboro's Cat (2004), for Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series. In addition, Page appeared in the cult hit TV series Trailer Park Boys (2001).As the lead in David Slade's Hard Candy (2005), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Page garnered much praise for her tour de force performance as a 14-year-old girl who meets a 30-year-old photographer on the Internet and then looks to expose him as pedophile. Films that followed included the title role of Bruce McDonald's The Tracey Fragments (2007); An American Crime (2007), also starring Catherine Keener; and the third installation of the X-Men franchise, X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), where she played Kitty Pryde.With her breakout role in Jason Reitman's hit comedy Juno (2007), about an offbeat teenager who finds herself unexpectedly pregnant, Page received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG Best Actress nominations, and won the Independent Spirit Award for her performance. She followed up that turn with the lead in Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, the roller-derby comedy-drama Whip It (2009), Christopher Nolan's psychological thriller Inception (2010), the independent film Peacock (2010), and the dark comedy Super (2010), opposite Rainn Wilson and Liv Tyler. Page co-starred alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Alec Baldwin, and Greta Gerwig in the Woody Allen ensemble comedy To Rome with Love (2012), and is set for the thriller The East (2013), a story centered on a contract worker tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group, only to find herself falling for its leader.
      Third actress to play Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat, replacing Katie Stuart from X2 (2003), who replaced Sumela Kay from X-Men (2000).
      Had to wear hair extensions for X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) as she had shaved her head bald for her role in Mouth to Mouth (2005).
      Is good friends with her X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) co-star, Ben Foster, and her Whip It (2009) co-star, Alia Shawkat.
      After filming the movie Marion Bridge (2002), she realized that acting is what she wanted to do for the rest of her life.
      Considers herself to be a feminist and tries to steer clear of the "stereotypical roles for teenage girls" because she finds them to be "sexist".
      She originally turned down the role of Kitty Pryde in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) until director Brett Ratner personally contacted her and talked her into it.
      After attending three different high schools, she graduated from the Shambhala School in Halifax.
      Ranked #1 on interview magazines Hollywood faces to watch "future stars of tomorrow" Along with Kellan Rhude.
      As of 2010 she is the fourth youngest actress to receive a Best Actress in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination at the age of 20 years and 335 days after receiving a nomination for her performance in Juno (2007). The younger actresses are Keira Knightley, aged 20 years and 311 days, for her role in Pride & Prejudice (2005), Isabelle Adjani, aged 20 years and 235 days, for her role in L'histoire d'Adèle H. (1975) and Keisha Castle-Hughes, aged 13 years and 309 days, for her role in Whale Rider (2002).
      Was the first choice for Christine in Drag Me to Hell (2009), but was forced to pass due to scheduling difficulties. That part later went to Alison Lohman.
      Was in consideration for the part of Natalie Keener in Up in the Air (2009) but Anna Kendrick, who went on to receive a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her performance, was cast instead.
      Was originally cast in Jane Eyre (2011) as the title role, but quit the project when production was delayed. Mia Wasikowska was later cast instead.
      Was originally cast as Jack in Jack and Diane (2012) but after dropping out of the project Riley Keough was cast instead.
      At 10-years old she was discovered by Halifax actor John Dunsworth while he was her visiting her school during filming the Pit Pony television series, which later she first starred in.
      At a Human Rights Campaign event in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day 2014, Ellen announced that she is gay. She had told her parents much earlier at age 19.
      The thing I like about acting is being able to lose yourself completely in someone else. I'm not that comfortable when I get recognized.
      I don't really want to do the Hollywood thing. I think you ought to try to say something with your movies.
      When I was 12, I realized I was very uncomfortable having my parents on set. So I told them that, and they understood.
      It's much simpler to be tortured on camera or to be filmed losing your mind. Whereas a script that has characters who are honest, witty and genuine... is often much harder to act.
      As a girl, you're supposed to love Sleeping Beauty. I mean, who wants to love Sleeping Beauty when you can be Aladdin?
      What I like about the film [Juno (2007)] is that it tackles an issue that we often treat as this really heavy, dark event and we look at it with a different perspective. She's extremely independent. She finds adoptive parents before she even tells her parents. I just think it's nice to not dwell in darkness.
      I'm a total shrimp, which makes me look younger. I'll be able to stay in that area longer, which is good, because there's more competition in your 20s. [on her slight frame]
      I come in at night and expect to see some transparent slut at the top of the stairs. [on her 19th century Halifax home, a former brothel]
      It was an intense movie and the response was polarized -- which was great, because it stuck in people's minds. That film has helped me immensely [on Hard Candy (2005)].
      I loved that this girl was mature in some ways, and naive in other ways. Juno (2007) is different from what we normally see in films about teenagers -- but, at the same time, she has a lot in common with most of the people I knew in high school. There are a lot of really intelligent teenage girls and boys who are unique and don't just listen to and dress like Britney Spears, and who don't just want to fuck the hot guy.
      For the role in An American Crime (2007), when I played someone who was starved and tortured, I lost a lot of weight, and my body and my mind were drained. After that, people told me, You really need to do a comedy. And I said I am -- I'm playing a 16-year-old who gets pregnant!
      You can choose who you want to be the hero [in Hard Candy (2005)], but you'll be second-guessing yourself -- there's just no right answer. Our society is obsessed with finding good and finding evil, but I think we're all capable of anything.
      I am a feminist and I am totally pro-choice, but what's funny is when you say that people assume that you are pro-abortion. I don't love abortion but I want women to be able to choose and I don't want white dudes in an office being able to make laws on things like this. I mean what are we going to do - go back to clothes hangers? [in the UK newspaper The Guardian, responding to being asked about the controversy aroused by her role in Juno (2007)]
      Usually, I could care less if my friends see my movies or not. In Nova Scotia I like to leave my job behind. So when friends say, 'Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see that one', I don't care. But 'Inception' was different. I was like, "Go see this!"
      [on working with Woody Allen on To Rome with Love (2012)] People prepare you for the first meeting and tell you it will be very short. And it is. I think I met him for seven minutes. I've never worked with a director who is as quiet and reserved. And that was weirdly intimidating. Not that I need someone to tell me I'm doing a good job. I don't. But his quietness made me wonder if what I was doing and what he was seeing was working.
      I feel fortunate that since I started acting at the age of ten I've had lovely people in my life, who are still in my life, who are older and have been there for me in a way that is supportive, but separate, from the work I do.

Ellen Philpotts-Page (born February 21, 1987), known professionally as Ellen Page, is a Canadian actress. She started her career in Canada with roles in the television shows Pit Pony, Trailer Park Boys, and ReGenesis. Page ventured into films, winning attention after starring in 2005 drama Hard Candy, before her breakthrough role as Juno (2007). Her other notable film roles have been in Smart People (2008), Whip It (2009), Super (2010), Inception (2010), and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), as well as providing the voice acting, motion capture and likeness for Jodie Holmes in the video game Beyond: Two Souls (2013).
Page has won more than 25 awards, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA for Juno.
Page was born and raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of Martha Philpotts, a teacher, and Dennis Page, a graphic designer.[1] She attended the Halifax Grammar School until grade 10, spent some time at Queen Elizabeth High School, and graduated from the Shambhala School in 2005. She also spent two years in Toronto, Ontario studying in the Interact Program at Vaughan Road Academy, along with close friend and fellow Canadian actor Mark Rendall.[2][3] Growing up, Page enjoyed playing with action figures and climbing trees.[4]
Page first acted in front of the camera in 1997 at age ten in the CBC television movie Pit Pony, which later spun off into a television series. This led to more roles in a number of small Canadian films and television series, notably playing Treena Lahey in season two of Trailer Park Boys. At 16, she was cast in Mouth to Mouth, an independent film shot in Europe.
Page starred in the 2005 movie Hard Candy and gained praise for "one of the most complex, disturbing and haunting performances of the year".[5] She also appeared in X-Men: The Last Stand as Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat), a girl who can walk through walls. In the previous X-Men movies, the part had been used in brief cameos played by other actresses, but never as a main character.
As the title character in Juno, Page garnered substantial praise; A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted her as being "frighteningly talented"[6] and Roger Ebert said, "Has there been a better performance this year than Ellen Page's creation of Juno? I do not think so".[7] Page was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, but lost to Marion Cotillard in La Vie En Rose. The role, however, did win her more than 20 awards, including a Canadian Comedy Award, Independent Spirit Award, and Satellite Award.
Page also co-starred in Smart People, which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Shot before Juno, but released afterwards, the film saw her playing overachieving daughter to Dennis Quaid's college professor character.[8] Page's other film credits include An American Crime, which premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival; The Tracey Fragments, which was released in November 2007 in Canada and May 2008 in the U.S.; and The Stone Angel.
In 2007, she was attached to play the title character in an adaptation of Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre[9][10] and had planned to work on an as-yet unmade film entitled Jack and Diane opposite Olivia Thirlby, with whom she co-starred in Juno[11] but it was announced in August 2009 that her role in Jack and Diane would be played by the actress Alison Pill. Before his death in January 2008, Heath Ledger had discussed with Page the idea of starring in his directorial debut, The Queen's Gambit.[12]
In 2008 she was ranked No. 86 on FHM's Sexiest Women in the World list, and No. 93 for 2009.[13] In June 2008, Page was listed in Entertainment Weekly's future A-List stars list.[14]
Page hosted Saturday Night Live on March 1, 2008.[15] On May 3, 2009 she guest starred in the episode "Waverly Hills 9-0-2-1-D'oh" of the animated series The Simpsons as a character named Alaska Nebraska, a parody of Hannah Montana.[16] She also starred in Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, Whip It, alongside Juliette Lewis, Marcia Gay Harden, Drew Barrymore and Kristen Wiig.[17] The film premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and had its wide release on October 2, 2009.[18]
She features in Michael Lander's film Peacock, opposite Cillian Murphy, Susan Sarandon, Bill Pullman and Josh Lucas, which was released in 2010 despite an original release date of 2009.[19][20][21] In August 2009, Page began shooting the big-budget Christopher Nolan thriller Inception, alongside co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ken Watanabe.[22] The film was released on July 16, 2010.[23]
She has starred in the film Super,[24] and will reportedly play Stacie Andree in an upcoming film about Laurel Hester.[25]
As of 2010[update], she serves as a spokesperson for Cisco Systems in a series of ads appearing in three commercials set in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. On May 26, 2010 it was reported in a column on "Deadline Hollywood" and by Entertainment Weekly that Page will star in the new HBO series Tilda alongside Diane Keaton, who plays the title role. Tilda is based on the life of Nikki Finke, the founder of the influential Hollywood blog, DeadlineHollywood.com.[26] Tilda was reportedly dropped by HBO due to friction between the creators.[27] She is also the narrator of the documentary on colony collapse disorder, Vanishing of the Bees, directed by Maryam Henein.
In April 2011 it was announced that Page would co-star in the Woody Allen film To Rome with Love alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Penélope Cruz, and Alec Baldwin.[28] In June 2012, Quantic Dream announced a video game entitled Beyond: Two Souls in which Page and Willem Dafoe portray the protagonists Jodie Holmes and Nathan Dawkins, respectively, released on 8 October 2013 in North America.[29][30][31]
Page reprised her role as Katherine "Kitty" Pryde in X-Men: Days of Future Past.[32][33] In February 2013, Page confirmed that her directorial debut will be titled Miss Stevens and will star Anna Faris. The script is written by Julia Hart and will be produced by Gary Gilbert, Jordan Horowitz and Doug Wald.[34][35]
In 2008, Page was one of 30 celebrities who participated in an online ad series for U.S. Campaign for Burma, calling for an end to the military dictatorship in Burma.[36] She describes herself as a pro-choice feminist.[37] She attended Buddhist school in her youth and practiced meditation and yoga.[38] On February 14, 2014, Page came out as a lesbian in remarks at the Human Rights Campaign's "Time to Thrive" conference.[39][40]

After training at the Neptune Theatre School, Halifax born-and-raised Ellen Page made her television debut at the age of 10 in the TV movie Pit Pony (1997). When it was turned into a TV series just over a year later, Page reprised her role as younger sister Maggie. Even at such a young age, she showed enormous talent, earning both a Genie nomination and a Young Artist Award nomination for her work in the series. 
From there, she played roles in two more Canadian series, Trailer Park Boys and Rideau Hall (both 2002). Although she made her feature film debut in the family flick I Downloaded a Ghost, it wasn't released until 2004. In the meantime, she won a 2003 ACTRA Maritimes Award for Outstanding PerformanceFemale for her second film, the small budget Canadian drama Marion Bridge.  
Page won her first Gemini award for the TV movie Mrs. Ashboro's Cat (2003), playing a remarkably mature teenager who moves with her father (Michael Ontkean) to the small town where her recently-deceased mother grew up. Roles followed in more TV movies such as Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story, Going for Broke (both 2003) and small budget films such as Love That Boy (2003) and Mouth to Mouth (2004). 
She joined a cast of well-known Canadian actors such as Paul Gross, Sandra Oh and Rebecca Jenkins for Wilby Wonderful (2004), about the odd inhabitants of a small town, and received another Genie award nomination for her supporting role, as well as an Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor Award at the Atlantic Film Festival.  
Back on TV, Ellen joined the cast of The Movie Network's sci-fi series ReGenesis in 2004, winning a second Gemini award for her work in the episode "Black Out." On the big screen, she turned in a remarkable performance as a 14-year-old girl out for revenge when she turns the tables on a pedophile (Patrick Wilson) in Hard Candy (2006). 
When she was cast as Kitty Pryde in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), Page gained international attention. Since filming the big budget blockbuster, she's returned to the genre she loves bestdark films such as the upcoming The Tracy Fragment, which she told Tribute TV she finds "intriguing to delve into." 
In 2007, Hollywood sat up and took notice when Page starred in the runaway independent hit Juno. For her work as a sassy pregnant teenager, she received both Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, as well as winning numerous awards from international film festivals and societies. Since then, she's starred as Dennis Quaid's daughter in the major motion picture Smart People (2008), been directed by Drew Barrymore in Whip It (2009), starred opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) and played one half of a young honeymooning couple in Woody Allen's To Rome With Love (2012). She most recently starred in the drama Touchy Feely(2013).
Once a soccer player at the provincial (Nova Scotia) level, Page keeps in shape by snowboarding, swimming, running, and bicycling.

Ellen Page was born on February 21st, 1987 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. She showed an early interest in drama and was picked for her first major role in the heart-warming TV series “Pit Pony”, when she was only 10 years old. This role in the pilot turned into a 44-episode TV series airing in 1999 with Ellen as regular cast member. Her performance in “Pit Pony” earned her nominations for the ‘Young Artist Award - Best Performance in a TV Drama Series - Leading Young Actress’ and ‘Gemini Award - Best Performance in a Children’s or Youth Program or Series’. This was the year 2000 and marked the beginning of Ellen’s ascending career. Following this success, Ellen showed up as recurring character in “Trailer Park Boys”. A ‘mockumentary’ style TV series, TPB rewarded Ellen with another nomination for the ‘Geminis’, this time in the category ‘Best Ensemble Cast’.In 2003 Ellen became a household name in Canada through her work on TV in the following productions: as guest in the series “Rideau Hall”, “Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story”, ”Going for Broke” and “Mrs. Ashboro’s Cat” (for which she received her first Gemini Award for ‘Best Performance in a Childrens’ or Youth Program or Series’). She was also in the following movies that year: “Touch & Go”, “Love That Boy” and “Marion Bridge” (for which she won an ‘Outstanding Performance Award’ at the ‘ACTRAs’ and praise from fellow actors and critics)The following year, Ellen was seen in the comedies “Wilby Wonderful” and “I Downloaded a Ghost”. IDAG was actually made earlier in 2002, because Ellen is obviously younger than in all the other releases at that time. The young Canadian then took a leading role in the British-German coproduction “Mouth to Mouth”. In 2004, Ellen embodied the popular character ‘Lilith Sandström’ in the first two seasons of the Canadian SciFi TV series “ReGenesis” which ran successfully till 2008.Looking back at the end of 2005, Ellen’s international breakthrough in 2006 appears inevitable. She took the part of ‘Hayley Stark’ in “Hard Candy”, a thriller/drama narrating the real life-encounter between a 14-year old girl and Jeff, a photographer in his early thirties. We suspect from the opening scene that he might be a pedophile - after repeatedly chatting with Hayley on the internet. At Jeff’s place things evolve in another direction than we initially anticipate. “Hard Candy” premiered successfully at ‘Sundance Film Festival’ in January 2005. Since then, it’s been accompanied by passionate and controversial discussions due to its real subject. However, her performance as Hayley smoothed Ellen’s way to be seen by a wider audience. The role of X-Men’s ‘Kitty Pryde’ (alias ‘Shadowcat’) was expanded in the 3rd part of the franchise, “X-Men: The Last Stand”. Director Brett Ratner - after seeing “Hard Candy” - suggested Ellen for the part, replacing Canadian actresses Katie Stuart and Sumela Kay, in the now larger role of Kitty.Leaving behind all the glamorous X-Men premiere galas in May 2006, Ellen got busy with numerous projects in summer of 2006 namely: “The Tracey Fragments”, “An American Crime”, “The Stone Angel” and “Smart People”. In early 2007, she went to Vancouver to film the comedy “Juno”, which would become one of the best movies of the year. After a visit to the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in the Czech Republic and some backpacking through Eastern Europe, Ellen started to promote her latest movies at Toronto Film Festival 2007 where she had three movies being screened. She earned a standing ovation from the audience for “Juno” and became a well-loved festival darling. After that she received many awards for her great performance in Jason Reitman’s comedy at several events and was named ‘Breakthrough Actress of the Year’ at the Hollywood Film Festival’s star-studded Hollywood Awards. The girl from Halifax also got a Golden Globe nomination for ‘Best Actress’ in December 2007 while “Juno” got a wider release in the United States.After an appearance on the widely seen “Late Show with David Letterman” in January 2008, where she got some brownie points, Ellen didn’t win the Golden Globe, but had the chance to win another important award. Beside four other famous actresses, she was up for “Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role” at the 80th Annual Academy Awards and became one of the youngest nominees ever. Although this award went to French actress Marion Cotillard, it was a great experience and honour for the 21 year old actress, who looked shell-shocked and humbled by her Oscar nomination experience. Overall, there's no doubt, the entire event gave her more control and choice over her career.In the following months, she hosted the popular “Saturday Night Live” show and visited the “Tonight Show with Jay Leno” to promote her recent movie “Smart People”, which was released in US theatres in April 2008. Furthermore, Ellen signed on to star opposite Cillian Murphy in the psychological thriller “Peacock” and in Drew Barrymore's directorial debut “Whip It”, which were both filmed in summer 2008. Later that year, she was in talks for a new BBC film adaption of the famous British romance novel “Jane Eyre”, written by Charlotte Bronte and a role in an upcoming feature film about the New Jersey Police officer, Laurel Hester, who was known for her fight for equal rights in 2005. However, there were no further details or any confirmation at this point.After taking a break, she signed on for Christopher Nolan’s thriller “Inception” joined joining fellow actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and Michael Caine. Production started in July 2009 and attracted a lot of media and public attention all over the globe. After filming wrapped in December, Ellen kept herself busy and only took a few weeks off before shooting James Gunn’s dark super hero comedy “SUPER” in Shreveport, Louisiana in January 2010. It subsequently premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September.Ellen went to “the Eternal City” to be in Woody Allen’s film set in Rome, alongside Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg and Greta Gerwig after doing some promo work for SUPER's US release, appearing on HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” and celebrating the Los Angeles premiere of the “Vanishing of the Bees” documentary. The Canadian actress first became aware of “Vanishing of the Bees” through some random events on the set of “Inception”. "Vanishing of the Bees" is a fascinating documentary about the mysterious disappearance of bees from beehives all around the world. She decided to join this project because it was important to her and served as narrator for the US version.It was announced in May 2010 that Ellen is officially set to play Stacie Andree in a full-length feature film based on the Oscar-winning documentary short “Freeheld”. She was also going to costar alongside Diane Keaton in the upcoming Hollywood blogger comedy series “Tilda”. Unfortunately, the pilot never aired on television because HBO passed on the project in February 2011.In the fall of 2011 she returned to Shreveport to star in “The East”, an eco-thriller featuring Brit Marling, Alexander Skarsgård and Patricia Clarkson, replacing another actress who dropped out because of a scheduling conflict.In her spare time away from the spotlight, Ellen likes to do a lot of different sports, loves to read, listen to music and enjoys camping with friends or just hanging out with them and having fun. She is also an outspoken environmental activist and has been involved with several green initiatives to stop the global warming and save the planet.(This biography is Copyright © 2006-2011 by Dominik Keppner and may not be reproduced without prior written consent) / Last Update: 02/08/2012

From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
