 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Demi Moore was born 1962 in Roswell, New Mexico. Her father, Charles Harmon, left her mother, Virginia King, before Demi was born. Her stepfather, Danny Guynes, did not add much stability to her life, either. He frequently changed jobs and made the family move a total of 40 times. The parents kept on drinking, arguing and beating, until Guynes finally committed suicide. Demi quit school at age 16 to work as a pin-up-girl. At 18, she married rock musician Freddy Moore; the marriage lasted four years. At 19, she became a regular on the soap opera General Hospital (1963). From the first salaries, she started partying and sniffing cocaine. That lasted more than three years, until director Joel Schumacher threatened to fire her from the set of St. Elmo's Fire (1985) when she turned up high. She got a withdrawal treatment and returned clean within a week... and stayed clean. With determination and a skill for publicity stunts, like the nude appearance on the cover of Vanity Fair while pregnant, she made her way to fame. Thanks to the huge commercial success of Ghost (1990) and the controversial pictures Indecent Proposal (1993) and Disclosure (1994), she's Hollywood's most sought-after and most expensive actress.In 2009, Demi Moore and spouse Ashton Kutcher launched The Demi and Ashton Foundation, a non-profit, non-governmental organization directed towards fighting child sexual slavery. Its first campaign in "Real Men Don't Buy Girls". On April 23, 2011, Demi and Ashton appeared together for their first on-air interview on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight (2011) to promote their foundation and start the work towards ending child sexual slavery. The foundation's website enables people to educate themselves, show support and take action or make a donation. They first got involved in the issue in 2008 and that a great deal of the early work just involved starting discussions, raising awareness and creating urgency.
      Without giving a reason, Bruce and Demi announced they were ending their marriage of eleven years in 1998, although Bruce did not file for divorce until the following year, and the divorce was not final until October 2000. [June 1998]
      She posed nude while seven months pregnant with daughter Scout LaRue Willis for a 1991 'Vanity Fair' magazine cover. In August 1992, she again posed nude for 'Vanity Fair', this time wearing body paint that resembled a man's suit.
      Stripped on Late Show with David Letterman (1993), allegedly to disprove rumors that she's too fat for her new movie Striptease (1996).
      In order to play a coke addict, Jules, in St. Elmo's Fire (1985), she had to sign a contract stipulating that she would stop her own alcohol and drug abuse, an agreement that caused her life to turn around.
      Was one of three finalists for the lead in Flashdance (1983). No one could decide between the three, so a group of about 50 men was brought into a room, shown the three audition tapes and asked who they would want to sleep with the most. Jennifer Beals won by a landslide.
      Demi's real father, Charles Harmon, abandoned the family before she was born, which is why she didn't share his last name on her birth certificate.
      Was spoofed in the video game Leisure Suit Larry 7: Love for Sail! (1996) as a hypersexual version of herself called "Dewmi (pronounced "Do Me") Moore".
      According to an article in the now defunct Buzz magazine, she was so demanding when it came to perks and fringe benefits, her nickname around Hollywood studio executives was "Gimme Moore".
      Was one of the nine original members of the 1980s "brat pack", along with Judd Nelson, Mare Winningham, Anthony Michael Hall, Andrew McCarthy, Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez and Ally Sheedy.
      The only Brat Packer to become a huge and long-lasting movie star after the Brat Pack era ended.
      Along with Pia Zadora, Madonna, Pauly Shore and Sylvester Stallone, one of the few people who have "won" back to back awards at the Razzies in successive years. She "won" Worst Actress of 1997 for her performances in the films The Juror (1996) and Striptease (1996), then again the next year she "won" Worst Actress for her role in G.I. Jane (1997).
      Her wedding with Ashton Kutcher was attended by about 100 guests. Among them were ex-husband Bruce Willis, their three daughters, Ashton's best friend and co-star from That '70s Show (1998), Wilmer Valderrama, and Demi's close friend Lucy Liu.
      Auditioned for (and won) the role of Jackie Templeton on General Hospital (1963) after producers put out a casting call for a "Margot Kidder/Karen Allen" type actress (both of whom were top box office stars at the time).
      Attended (but did not graduate from) Fairfax High School in Los Angeles with actor/producer Byron Allen.
      Her professional first name "Demi" (short for her birth name Demetria) is pronounced "deh-ME", not "DEM-ee", with emphasis on the second syllable just as in "Demetria".
      In 1995, she became the highest-paid actress in film history, up until that time, earning $12.5 million for Striptease (1996).
      Was 20th Century Fox's choice to play Katharine Clifton in The English Patient (1996). However, the film's producers refused to give in on the studio's decision to cast Moore, and as a result Fox backed out of the film. Eventually, the film was picked up by Miramax and the role was given to Kristin Scott Thomas.
      Auditioned for the role of Luisa Contini in Nine (2009), but Marion Cotillard was cast in the part instead.

      The controversial Vanity Fair magazine cover of Moore - nude and pregnant - was photographed by Annie Leibovitz in May 1991.
      Showed interest in playing the title role in Æon Flux (2005) in 1997 before the project was put on the back burner.
      Met first husband Freddy Moore at the Troubadour nightclub in Los Angeles when she was 16 years old.

      (December 21, 2012) Third husband Ashton Kutcher filed for divorce after a 13 month separation and 7 years of marriage.
      A huge fan of Susan Boyle. When Moore enthused about her on Twitter, the millions who followed helped to turn Boyle into a global megastar. Sadly, Boyle didn't know much about Moore and nothing about Moore's husband Ashton Kutcher.
      There's this idea that if you take your clothes off, somehow you must have loose morals. There's still a negative attitude in our society towards women who use a strength that's inherent - their femininity - in any way that might be considered seductive.
      Time is an amazing equalizer. I think if you stay true to yourself and keep moving forward, things come around.
      On the changes made to Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter" (she starred in the adaptation): In truth, not very many people have read the book...the ultimate message of "Hester Prynne" would have been lost if we'd stayed with the original ending.
      I didn't want to work and drag my kids with me while they were trying to cross this huge transition. I wanted them to become as stable and as confident as possible. There are people who go through this and don't have the financial means, but I did. It wasn't a risk; it was the right thing to do.
      Once you've tasted a bit of success, it's more challenging. We have to continue to be willing to take a risk so that we don't get too safe. Unwillingness to risk failure is always there, but it gets harder when you feel you have more to lose. So the better place to keep yourself in is out of your comfort zone, willing to try even at the risk of failing. And that's not natural to me at all. In fact, it's completely unnatural.
      I think we all want the same things. We all want to feel loved, and feel a part of something, but we all have self-doubt no matter where we came from.
      [on plastic surgery] It's completely false, I've never had it done. It's a way to combat your neurosis. The scalpel won't make you happy. For the moment I prefer to be a beautiful woman of my age than try desperately to look thirty.

Demi Guynes Kutcher (/dəˈmiː/ de-MEE; born November 11, 1962),[n 1] known professionally as Demi Moore, is an American actress, film producer, film director, former songwriter, and model. Moore dropped out of high school at age 16 to pursue an acting career, and posed for a nude pictorial in Oui magazine in 1980. After making her film debut in 1981, she appeared on the soap opera General Hospital and subsequently gained recognition for her roles in Blame It on Rio (1984) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985). Her first film to become both a critical and commercial hit was About Last Night... (1986), which established her as a Hollywood star.
In 1990, Moore starred in Ghost, the highest-grossing film of that year, which brought her a Golden Globe nomination. She had a string of additional box-office successes over the early 1990s with A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993), and Disclosure (1994). In 1996, Moore became the highest-paid actress in film history when she was paid a then-unprecedented fee of $12.5 million to star in Striptease. The high-profile disappointment of that film as well as her next, G.I. Jane (1997), was followed by a lengthy hiatus and significant downturn in Moore's career, although she has remained a subject of substantial media interest during the years since.
Moore took her professional name from her first husband, musician Freddy Moore, and is the mother of three daughters from her second marriage to actor Bruce Willis. She was married to her third husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, from 2005 to 2013.
Moore was born in Roswell, New Mexico. Her biological father, Air Force airman Charles Harmon, Sr.[12] left her mother, Virginia (née King), after a two-month marriage, before Moore was born.[13] When Moore was three months old, her mother married Dan Guynes, a newspaper advertising salesman who frequently changed jobs; as a result, the family moved many times.[14] Moore said in 1991, "My dad was Dan Guynes. He raised me. There is a man who would be considered my biological father who I don't really have a relationship with."[13] Moore learned of him at age 13, when she found her mother and stepfather's marriage certificate and inquired about the circumstances since "I saw my parents were married in February 1963. I was born in '62."[13] Dan Guynes committed suicide in October 1980 at age 37, two years after he separated from Moore's mother.[13] Charles Harmon appeared on Inside Edition in 1995, making an appeal to see his grandchildren.[15] Virginia Guynes had a long record of arrests for crimes, including drunk driving and arson.[16] Moore broke off contact with her in 1990, when Guynes walked away from a rehab stay Moore had paid for at the Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota.[17] Guynes publicly embarrassed her daughter by posing nude for the low-end magazine High Society in 1993,[18] where she spoofed Moore's controversial Vanity Fair pregnancy and bodypaint covers, and parodied her love scene from the film Ghost. Moore and Guynes briefly reconciled shortly before Guynes died of cancer in July 1998 at age 54.[19]
Moore has a maternal half-brother, Morgan Guynes, who in 1988 was a U.S. Marine stationed in North Carolina, and gave her away at her wedding the previous year;[20] two paternal half-brothers, Charles Harmon Jr.[12] and James Craig Harmon (b. 1974[21]) who in 2006 was sentenced to 10 years in jail for aggravated assault;[21] and a paternal half-sister, Charlotte Harmon Eggar, who in 2012 said she had not seen Moore in 30 years.[12]
Moore was cross-eyed as a child; this was ultimately corrected by two surgeries. She also suffered from kidney dysfunction.[14] At age 15, Moore moved to West Hollywood, California, where her mother worked for a magazine-distribution company.[13] Moore attended Fairfax High School there,[13] and recalled, "I moved out of my family's house when I was 16 and left high school in my junior year."[22] She signed with the Elite Modeling Agency and went to Europe to work as a pin-up girl,[23] then enrolled in drama classes after being inspired by her next-door neighbor, 17-year-old German actress Nastassja Kinski.[24] In August 1979, three months before her 17th birthday,[24] Moore met married[24] musician Freddy Moore, at the time leader of the band Boy, at the Los Angeles nightclub The Troubadour.[25] They married in early 1980 and lived in an apartment in West Hollywood.[25]
Demi Moore co-wrote three songs with Freddy Moore and appeared in the music video for their "It's Not a Rumor," performed by his band The Nu Kats.[26] She continues to receive royalty checks from her brief songwriting career (1980-1981).[27]
Moore appeared on the cover of the January 1981 issue of the adult magazine Oui, in which she posed for a series of photographs containing full frontal nudity.[28][29] In a 1988 interview, Moore claimed she "only posed for the cover of Oui—I was 16; I told them I was 18" and that the photos inside "were for a European fashion magazine."[30] In 1990, she told another interviewer, "I was 17 years old. I was underage. It was just the cover."[31]
Moore made her film debut with a small supporting role in the deaf-teen drama Choices (1981), directed by Silvio Narizzano.[32] Her second feature was the 1982 3-D science fiction/horror film Parasite, for which director Charles Band had instructed casting director Johanna Ray to "find me the next Karen Allen."[28] Moore then joined the cast of the ABC soap opera General Hospital, playing the role of investigative reporter Jackie Templeton from December 1981 to March 1984. During her tenure on the series, she made an uncredited cameo appearance in the 1982 spoof Young Doctors in Love.[33]
Moore's film career took off in 1984 following her appearance in the sex comedy Blame It on Rio.[34] That same year, she played the lead role in No Small Affair. Her commercial breakthrough came in Joel Schumacher's yuppie drama St. Elmo's Fire (1985), which received negative reviews but was a box office success[35] and brought Moore to international recognition.[36] Because of her association with that film, Moore was often listed as part of the Brat Pack, a label she felt was "demeaning."[37] She progressed to more serious material with About Last Night... (1986), co-starring Rob Lowe, which marked a positive turning point in her career,[38] as Moore noted that, following its release, she began seeing better scripts.[39] Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and praised her performance, writing, "There isn't a romantic note she isn't required to play in this movie, and she plays them all flawlessly."[40] The success of About Last Night... was unrivaled by Moore's other two 1986 releases, One Crazy Summer and Wisdom, the last youth-oriented films she would star in.[41]
Moore made her professional stage debut in an Off-Broadway production of The Early Girl, which ran at the Circle Repertory Company in fall 1986.[42] In 1988, Moore starred as a prophecy-bearing mother in the apocalyptic drama The Seventh Sign—her first outing as a solo film star.[39] The following year, she played the quick-witted local laundress and prostitute in Neil Jordan's Depression-era allegory We're No Angels (1989) opposite Robert De Niro.
Her most successful film as of 2014 was the supernatural romantic melodrama Ghost, a sleeper hit that grossed over $505 million at the box office and was the highest-grossing film of 1990.[43] The love scene between Moore and Patrick Swayze that starts in front of a potter's wheel while the song "Unchained Melody" plays in the blackground has become an iconic moment in cinema history.[44][45] Ghost was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Moore's performance as Molly Jensen earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination as Best Actress.[46]
In 1991, Moore co-produced and starred in the mystery thriller Mortal Thoughts, and appeared as a blonde for the first time in the romantic comedy The Butcher's Wife, with Roger Ebert's review describing her as "warm and cuddly".[47] Both films were box-office disappointments, but Moore sustained her A-list status with her starring roles in Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men (1992), Adrian Lyne's Indecent Proposal (1993), and Barry Levinson's Disclosure (1994)—all of which opened at #1 at the box office and were blockbuster hits.[48]
By 1995, Moore was the highest-paid actress in Hollywood.[49] However, she subsequently had a string of unsuccessful films starting with The Scarlet Letter, a "freely adapted" version of the historical romance novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, in which her portrayal of Hester Prynne was met with harsh criticism.[50] Despite the poor reception of that film and the indifferent box office of her follow-up releases, Now and Then and The Juror, Moore was paid a record-breaking salary of $12.5 million in 1996 to star in Striptease.[49][51] Much hype was made about Moore's willingness to dance topless for the part, though this was the sixth time she had shown her breasts on film.[17] Although the film was actually a financial success—grossing over $113 million worldwide[52]—it failed to reach expectations and was widely considered a flop.[53] Meanwhile, she also produced and starred in a controversial miniseries for HBO called If These Walls Could Talk, a three-part anthology about abortion. Its screenwriter, Nancy Savoca, directed two segments, including one in which Moore played a widowed nurse in the early 1950s seeking a back-alley abortion. For that role, Moore received a second Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress.[46]
Moore famously shaved her head in order to play a Navy SEAL recruit in Ridley Scott's G.I. Jane (1997). The film was a moderate box office success,[54] but its domestic gross was only slightly more than it cost to make.[55] During the film's production, it was reported that Moore had ordered studio chiefs to charter two planes for her and her entourage,[56] which reinforced her negative reputation for being a diva[57]—she had previously turned down the Sandra Bullock role in While You Were Sleeping because the studio refused to meet her salary demands,[58] and was dubbed "Gimme Moore" by the media.[55]
After G.I. Jane, Moore took the role of an ultra-pious psychiatrist in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry, then retreated from the spotlight and moved to Hailey, Idaho on a full-time basis to devote herself to raising her three daughters.[59] She was offscreen for three years before re-emerging in the arthouse drama Passion of Mind (2000), the first English-language film from Belgian director Alain Berliner. Her performance was well-received,[60][61] but the film itself garnered mixed reviews and was deemed "naggingly slow" by some critics.[61] Moore then resumed her self-imposed career hiatus and continued to turn down film offers.[62] Producer Irwin Winkler said in 2001, "I had a project about a year and a half ago, and we made an inquiry about her—a real good commercial picture. She wasn't interested."[55]
Another three years passed before Moore acted again. She returned to the screen, playing a villain in the 2003 film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,[63] but that was followed by yet another three-year absence. In the interim, Moore signed on as the face of the Versace fashion brand[64] and the Helena Rubinstein brand of cosmetics.[65] In 2006, she appeared in Bobby which featured an all-star cast, including her husband Ashton Kutcher, although they did not appear in any scenes together.
Moore reunited with Blame It on Rio co-star Michael Caine for the British crime drama Flawless, which came out in a limited release in 2008 with generally positive reviews.[66] As of 2014, her last appearance in a widely released film was in 2007's Mr. Brooks with Kevin Costner. Moore has since acted in a number of independent films, the most distinguishable of which have been The Joneses (2010) with David Duchovny and the critically acclaimed corporate drama Margin Call (2011), where she was part of an ensemble cast that included Kevin Spacey, Simon Baker and Paul Bettany.
Moore had been cast to play feminist activist Gloria Steinem in the Linda Lovelace biographical film Lovelace,[67] but within a month of being announced for the role, she dropped out of the production in the wake of a January 23, 2012 hospitalization and what her representative called "professional assistance to treat her exhaustion and improve her overall health."[68] Sarah Jessica Parker took over the role.[69]
In August 1991, Moore appeared nude on the cover of Vanity Fair under the title More Demi Moore. Annie Leibovitz shot the picture while Moore was seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue, intending to portray "anti-Hollywood, anti-glitz" attitude.[70] The cover sparked an intense controversy for Vanity Fair and Moore. It was widely discussed on television, radio, and in newspaper articles.[71] The frankness of Leibovitz's portrayal of a pregnant sex symbol led to divided opinions, ranging from complaints of sexual objectification to celebrations of the photograph as a symbol of empowerment.[72]
The photograph was subject to numerous parodies, including the Spy magazine version which placed Moore's then-husband Bruce Willis' head on her body. In Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp., Leibovitz sued over one parody featuring Leslie Nielsen, made to promote the 1994 film Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult. In the parody, the model's body was attached to what is described as "the guilty and smirking face" of Nielsen. The teaser said "Due this March".[73] The case was dismissed in 1996 because the parody relied "for its comic effect on the contrast between the original".[73] In November 2009, the Moroccan magazine Femmes du Maroc emulated the infamous pose with Moroccan news reporter Nadia Larguet, causing controversy in the majority Muslim nation.[74]
In August 1992, Moore again appeared nude on the cover of Vanity Fair, modeling for body painting artist Joanne Gair in Demi's Birthday Suit.[75][76]
Moore was a founding "celebrity investor" in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe and launched in New York on October 22, 1991) along with Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and former husband Bruce Willis.[77] She was the executive producer of all three of the films in the successful Austin Powers franchise,[78] as well as an interview series for the Lifetime network called The Conversation.[79]
On February 8, 1980, she married singer Freddy Moore, 12 years her senior.[82] Before their marriage, Demi had already begun using Freddy's surname as her stage name.[27] She filed for divorce in September 1984; it was finalized on August 7, 1985.[27]
Following her divorce from Freddy Moore, Moore was engaged to actor Emilio Estevez. The pair had planned to marry in December 1986, but called off the engagement.[83]
On November 21, 1987, Moore married her second husband, actor Bruce Willis.[84] She stated on her marriage license that this was her first marriage, explaining in an interview the following year, "I did it only because I thought it was going to take longer if I put that [first marriage] on there."[20] She and Willis have three daughters together: Rumer (born August 16, 1988),[85] Scout (born July 20, 1991),[86] and Tallulah (born February 3, 1994).[87] The couple separated on June 24, 1998,[19] but did not file for divorce until October 18, 2000.[88] Their divorce was finalized one day after the filing.[89]
Moore had a longstanding relationship with martial arts instructor Oliver Whitcomb, whom she dated from 1999 to 2002.[90]
In 2003, Moore began dating actor Ashton Kutcher, who is 15 years her junior. They married on September 24, 2005.[91] The wedding was attended by about 150 close friends and family of the couple, including Willis.[92] In November 2011, after months of media speculation about the state of the couple's marriage, Moore announced her decision to end her marriage to Kutcher.[93] After over a year of separation, Kutcher filed for divorce from Moore on December 21, 2012 in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.[94] Moore filed her response papers in March 2013, requesting spousal support and payment of legal fees from Kutcher.[95][96] On November 27, 2013, their divorce was finalized.[97]
On January 28, 1998, Moore and Willis sued their former nanny, Kim Tannahill, in a U.S. district court in Blaine County, Idaho, claiming she billed them for personal expenses, reneged on some $8,000 worth of loans and spoke about their private lives in violation of a confidentiality agreement.[98] The couple sought at least $300,000 in damages.[98] On February 2, 1998, Tannahill filed a countersuit in a Los Angeles Superior Court.[98] In that lawsuit, Tannahill claimed that she was subjected to "intimidation, threats and force," and accused Moore of locking her in a bedroom for a two-hour "verbal beating" upon firing her in August 1997,[98] quoting Moore as saying "It's scary what I could do to you."[98] Tannahill's lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge in April 1998,[99] while the suit filed by Moore and Willis was settled out of court.
In May 2003, Moore was sued by the former manager of her Idaho ranch, Lawrence Bass, for sexual harassment and discrimination.[100] Bass sought more than $250,000 in damages, claiming in his lawsuit that Moore approached him in the same manner as did her character with Michael Douglas in the 1994 film Disclosure, then fired him, months later, after he had turned down her advances.[100] Bass, who also filed complaints with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Idaho's Human Rights Commission,[101] had been the subject of seven restraining orders, was arrested in 1998 for domestic abuse, and was wanted for failing to answer a five-count criminal harassment complaint against him.[101] Idaho state investigators ruled there was "no probable cause" to support his allegations against Moore.[102] The case was dismissed in February 2004.[103] Moore filed a countersuit against Bass, who served a 10-day jail sentence for civil contempt.[102]
She is a follower of Philip Berg's Kabbalah Centre religion, and initiated Kutcher into the faith, having said that she "didn't grow up Jewish, but ... would say that [she has] been more exposed to the deeper meanings of particular rituals than any of [her] friends that did."[104]
According to The New York Times, Moore is "the world's most high-profile doll collector," and among her favorites is the Gene Marshall fashion doll.[105] At one point, Moore kept a separate residence to house her 2,000 dolls.[98]
While she landed on PETA's Worst-Dressed List in 2009 for wearing fur,[106] two years later she supported the group's efforts to ban circus workers' use of bullhooks on elephants.[107]
Since 2013, Moore has been practicing Kundalini Yoga as originally taught by Yogi Bhajan. She has been taking classes in Malibu with Kundalini teacher Tej Kaur, sometimes with daughter Rumer Willis.[108] Celebrity Fix reported that Moore has done her training and plans to teach this yoga.[109]
In 2009,[110] Moore and Kutcher launched The Demi and Ashton Foundation (DNA), a nonprofit, non-governmental organization directed towards fighting child sexual slavery.[111][112] Its first campaign was "Real Men Don't Buy Girls."[113] In November 2012, the foundation said it was announcing "a new name and refined mission"[114] as Thorn, which aimed "to disrupt and deflate the predatory behavior of those who abuse and traffic children, solicit sex with children or create and share child pornography".[110]

1976On the RoadBy the age of 14, Moore, a self-described "trailer park kid," has moved at least 30 times. Her parents, Danny and Virginia, divorce the following year, and Moore settles in L.A. with her mother, where she eventually drops out of Fairfax High School at 16. She works as a debt collector and takes up acting in earnest after reading scripts with a young German neighbor and aspiring actress named Nastassja Kinski.1980White Wedding DayMoore, 18, marries rocker Freddy Moore, 30, whose last name she adopts as her own. Their marriage lasts for four years, and ends amicably. "I'm not surprised she's now the star she is," he later tells London's Daily Mirror. "She's a genius." In 1982, she plays reporter Jackie Templeton on General Hospital. "She had street smarts," GH veteran Norma Connolly tells PEOPLE. "She learned fast."1984February 17Undress for SuccessMoore bares her chest in her first major motion picture, Blame It on Rio. Over the next 12 years, she will appear topless on screen five more times and nude on two Vanity Fair covers.Brat Pack UnleashedMoore plays the emotionally damaged Jules in the hit St. Elmo's Fire.

=======================================================
                Demi Kutcher, best known as Demi Moore, is an American actress who rose to stardom amongst a group of peers who were dubbed the Brat Pack.Moore was born Demetria Gene Guynes in 1962, in Roswell, New Mexico and spent much of her childhood and teenage years in Perryopolis, Pennsylvania. She had a difficult and unstable childhood culminating with her step-father’s suicide in 1980. Her mother was abandoned by Moore’s birth father while she was still pregnant with Moore. However, she soon married Danny Guynes, a newspaper advertising salesman. Guynes, a gambler with an unstable job history, made his new family move from town to town on numerous occasions. Moore's mother and step-father were alcoholics who often fought and beat each other. Besides these personal setbacks, the young Moore also suffered medical problems which included kidney dysfunction and an eye condition. She had ‘crossed eyes’, requiring two separate operations to correct. Moore's family finally settled in Los Angeles in 1976. When she was sixteen and ambitious to become a model, her friend and future actress Nastassja Kinski persuaded her to drop out of Hollywood's Fairfax High School to become an actress. In 1979, she met and married her first husband songwriter Freddy Moore. The marriage lasted six years and they divorced in 1985. In the early 1980s, Moore posed for a series of nude photographs. Although at first unnoticed, these photographs were eventually published in a German magazine and later in North America. Moore’s first major acting role was in the made-for-television soap opera 'General Hospital' on ABC. She played the part of Jackie Templeton during 1982 and 1983. Her initial movie break came with the Silvio Narrizano directed 'Choices' in 1981. This was followed by the 3-D science fiction/horror film 'Parasite' and a bit part in 'Young Doctors in Love' in 1982. A further career-building movie was the 'Blame it on Rio' (1984), in which she played the daughter of Michael Caine’s character. Fame followed in 1985 when Moore starred in Joel Schumacher’s era-defining hit 'St. Elmo's Fire'. A string of commercially successful movies in the 1990s ('Ghost', 'A Few Good Men, 'Indecent Proposal', 'Disclosure' and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame') turned Moore into one of Hollywood’s most sought after and expensive actresses. Moore became a household name and was rated as the highest paid actress in Hollywood. The role in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' made her the first Hollywood actress to reach the US$10 million salary mark. She became a pioneer for other actresses by being the first female lead to demand the same salary, benefits and billing as her male counterparts.Her super-stardom was assured in 1990 when she co-starred with Patrick Swayze in the classic film 'Ghost' for which she received a Golden Globe award for her performance. The on-screen chemistry between Moore and Swayze remains a cinematic highlight. A further acting highlight was her MTV Movie Award for best on-screen kiss shared with Woody Harrelson in 'Indecent Proposal'. Her public success was belied by personal problems and supposed instability. She was known as a member of the infamous “Brat Pack”, which also included actors such as Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe and Molly Ringwald. While starring in 'St. Elmo's Fire', Moore played a dual role as a cocaine addict, both on and off-screen. She was reportedly fired from the film at one point and then re-hired after receiving an ultimatum from the film's director and choosing to go into rehab. On-screen trouble again reared its head during the 1990s when Moore starred in a number of box office flops that included 'Nothing But Trouble', 'Mortal Thoughts' and 'The Butcher's Wife'. However, her performance alongside movie heavyweights Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise in the court room drama 'A Few Good Men' fully restored her standing in Hollywood. After a failed engagement to Emilio Estevez in the 80s, she met and eventually married Moonlighting star 'Bruce Willis' in 1987 in a Las Vegas ceremony presided over by singer Little Richard. The pair had three daughters - Rumer Willis born in 1988, Scout LaRue Willis born in 1991 and Tallulah Belle Willis born in 1994. The relationship was lengthy by Hollywood standards and lasted until 1998 when the pair separated and divorced in 2000. Although divorced, the two have never lost their friendship and remain close. Besides her movie career, Moore was a founding "celebrity investor" in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modelled after the Hard Rock Cafe and launched in New York on 22nd October, 1991). Fellow investors included Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and then-husband Willis. The restaurant chain became an international success with franchises worldwide. Controversy ensued when Moore once again posed nude. Images taken by the American celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz appeared on the cover of the August 1991 issue of the fashion magazine Vanity Fair. The stylish image showed Moore fully nude while seven months pregnant with her second daughter Scout LaRue. Intending to portray an "anti-glamour" attitude, the cover sparked intense controversy for both the magazine and Moore. Discussions took place across a range of media and hit the headlines for days. The negative public reaction resulted in some retailers pulling the magazine issue from newsstands while other outlets used brown paper bags for the sale of the magazine. The raw frankness of the image and the portrayal of a pregnant sex symbol led to divided opinions, ranging from complaints of sexual objectification to celebrations of the photograph as a symbol of empowerment. She was back on the magazine's cover the following year, nude again but foetus-free and sporting a layer of artfully applied body paint.She was again nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in the mid-90s when she produced and starred in a TV mini-series on abortion called 'If These Walls Could Talk', written by Nancy Savoca. Moore portrayed a single woman in the 1950s seeking a back-street termination. After a break from acting in 1997, Moore returned to the screen in 2000 ('Passion of Mind') and again tasted cinematic success in her role as the antagonistic villain in the 2003 film 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'. Her role as a femme fatale earned her praise for being on the wrong side of 30 and having an immensely lithe figure. In 2006, she appeared in 'Bobby', directed by Emilio Estevez, which featured an all-star cast including her current husband Ashton Kutcher - though they did not appear in any scenes together. She portrayed Virginia Fallon in the movie, which received mixed to negative reviews, but picked up a Hollywood Film Award for Ensemble of the year and a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture. In June 2007, 'Mr. Brooks' was released. Moore starred alongside Kevin Costner as a tough-as-nails detective on the trail of an obsessive suburban serial killer. The thriller received mixed reviews, but performed well at the box office and paved the way for her appearance in 'Happy Tears' (2009), an independent comedy-drama. She then teamed up with David Duchovny for 'The Joneses', which was a box office flop despite receiving largely positive reviews.In 2010, Moore stepped into a different world when she starred in 'Bunraku', a martial arts live action/animation, which also featured Josh Hartnett and Ron Perlman. Moore is scheduled to star in 'Margin Call', a 2011 independent drama featuring Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany and Zachary Quinto. 'LOL: Laughing Out' Loud will also see her star with Miley Cyrus and is set to be released in 2011. Moore turned her hand to directing for the TV film 'Five', which was shown on Lifetime on 10 October 2011. The TV film, which also has segments directed by Jennifer Anniston and Alicia Keys, shows that breast cancer can affect everyone regardless of age, gender and income. Of her directorial debut, Moore told the Today programme: "Part of what motivated me was wanting to bridge that divide that says, 'No, that happens to other people,' and in doing so, to share with others the value and importance of getting out of that denial." Having appeared in some 50 titles to date, Moore has over the course of her career collected more than ten awards and received over 15 nominations including two Golden Globes. Moore and Ashton Kutcher, the former 'Punk'd' and 'That 70’s Show' star, started dating in 2003 after meeting at a dinner in Manhattan. Although 15 years her junior, a strong relationship developed between the couple and, amid much press speculation and interest, the pair married in September 2005. The lavish wedding was attended by hundreds of people and included her former husband Bruce Willis and their three daughters. Moore's primary residence is in Hailey, Idaho, near the famous Sun Valley resort, although she spends much time in the Los Angeles area with Kutcher. She is a practicing follower of the Rabbi Philip Berg's trendy Kabbalah Centre religion and initiated Kutcher into the faith, having said that she "didn’t grow up Jewish", but went on to say that she has been "more exposed to the deeper meanings of particular rituals". In April 2011, the couple launched the 'Demi and Ashton Foundation" – a non-profit, non-government organisation which aims to fight child sexual slavery across the globe. On 23 April 2011, the pair appeared on Piers Morgan Tonight to be interviewed about the charity together for the first time. The foundation’s website enables the public to educate themselves about the issue, show their support and donate money. Moore and Kutcher are currently making headlines as accusations that the actor had a fling on their sixth wedding anniversary have surfaced. The actress has lost weight and rumours are abound that the pair will divorce. Moore is a passionate 'raw foodist' and vegan, creating an interesting contrast with her extensive cosmetic surgery including breast implants, numerous collagen injections, liposuction, cheek implants, eyelid lift, and a procedure to lift sagging skin around her knees. According to Playboy magazine, Moore is one of the sexiest movies stars in Hollywood history. In her personal life, Moore's relationship with her mother was rocky at the best of times, stemming from Moore's unhappy and difficult childhood. Both mother and daughter became alcoholics and at one stage checked into a drug-and-alcohol-recovery programme. Her mother's recovery efforts failed. In 1990, Moore footed the bill for an eight month stay in rehab, but the relationship ended when Guynes sold the story of their troubles to the media. Over the following years, Guynes humiliated her daughter twice with pictorials in adult magazines. This included her 1993 12-page spread in the porn magazine High Society (after being turned down by Playboy). She posed in front of a potter's wheel, parodying Moore’s sex scene with Patrick Swayze in 'Ghost'. In 1998, Guynes died from a brain tumour in New Mexico at the age of 54. In addition to being a successful actress, Moore was also the producer of the hugely successful 'Austin Powers' movies starring Mike Myers. For an actress leaning towards dramatic roles, the switch to comedy was considered a brave and inspired move. Now in her late 40s, Moore remains one of Hollywood's most alluring, recognisable and admired female stars. Her current industry standing allows her to pick and choose roles that include co-stars associated with Hollywood's A-list. Her longevity as a hugely successful female lead actor has only ever been matched by a handful of her peers.
